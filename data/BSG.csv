I was was raised on ST:TNG. Every Saturday at 10pm a new episode would premiere, and I can remember being an eager 8 year-old to watch it. 

Science fiction is more than just a ""cool story"" -- it allows us to place present problems into a ""future"" landscape. Science fiction also allows us to map our responses and consequences beforehand. 

ST: TNG brought up many moral problems -- The re-imagined BSG has done done the same and honed in on relevant struggles today. 

If you're a reader like I am -- and love Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, you know what I am trying to convey. 

BSG needs to be put back on television. It won awards and made money, yet they walked away. 

""Blood and Chrome"" isn't an ideal expression of BSG, but I feel that we as a community need to support it, promote it, and let the network know it will make them money.

And then someone says to the President of the United States, which is George W. Bush, ""They've been taken care of. Thank God you saved the world again."" And you turn, and you see who told him that, and it's one of the Cylons.

I think that contact with modern Earth society would've been very interesting. It would've better than the show's canon ending anyway.

I love pretty much all the characters, but one of them really stood out to me:

Laura motherfrakking Roslin. She is a badass without having to shoot a gun or fly a viper. To quote a Dos Equis commercial, 1/3 of her weight is gravitas. 

Her family's dead, she has terminal cancer, and like 40 people before her in the presidential succession were killed. And what does she do? She accepts the responsibility with grace. Godsdamn. Yeah, she made tons of retarded decisions, but most of those were attempts to help the human race hold on.

The scene i like the most was in ""Blood on the Scales"" (I think):

######During the mutiny, Zarek tells her that Adama was executed. Instead of crying like a little bitch, she's like FRAK YOU I WILL END YOU.

 Also from Daybreak:

######leaving sickbay to go to the hangar deck before the final battle. Making everyone else look like a pussy. 

I wish I could handle shitty situations with as much positivity and grace as her. Also my heart shattered during the finale, which I found to be a fitting end.

TLDR; Roslin 2012.

1368746976.0,79,self.BSG,1ehfcd,"I just finished watching the series! I gotta say, I actually LOVED the ending. [Spoilers!]",BrainsAreCool,93,14,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/1ehfcd/i_just_finished_watching_the_series_i_gotta_say_i/,"I'm actually extremely satisfied with the ending, the story, and the way it was told. I think I can safely say that I called the ending early on, which I'm pretty grateful for since it means I wasn't at all disappointed. Throughout the series I didn't really care for the the idea that there was some supernatural God or force controlling events in peoples lives. I found myself liking characters like Adama and John the most because they at least seemed to be the only ones able to keep their heads above the tide of confusion around them. For a while whether or not there are supernatural forces at work in the BSG universe was somewhat of a mystery. That is, until the hybrid started muttering things about a cycle, that's when it all clicked. 

There are no supernatural forces in the BSG universe. What's really going on here is some malevolent and controlling force is essentially farming the human race. All of this has happened before and will happen again. When the hybrid came back with that statement is when my mind started racing. Basically, the cycle is this: Humans have a tendency to make robotic life, humans make robotic life, and then that life seeks to destroy the humans. When the humans landed on new Earth everybody went their separate ways and they sent their ships into the sun. However... the centurions were given their independence and were sent away to be forgotten by humanity. Meaning that this perfectly orchestrated cycle was designed to do one thing and one thing only: produce new robotic life. 

I suspect that whatever this force is that's responsible for coordinating these events is probably a machine force of some kind which would explain why the hybrids can access it to provide us with occasional insight into their master plan. It would also account for their motives; they want to learn about their origins and better themselves. Human life probably created them and by forcing humans to undergo a cycle where they continually create new lifeforms they're able to learn more about themselves and grow exciting new robotic lifeforms like the centurions. Which I think is downright delicious science fiction. 

The Caprica 6 and Gaius Baltar had a shared vision and were unwitting tools for this force. It was Caprica 6 who gave the centurions free will thereby granting them independence to explore the cosmos alone. It was Starbuck who was a key pawn in making sure that humanity found new Earth, a planet which I suspect was probably terraformed  and seeded by this entity, force, civilization or whatever. Whoever these overseers are they probably also are responsible for baiting the cylons and teaching them about resurrection. It's even possible that they acquired and reprogrammed them to serve their own ends. Whether or not they're strictly interested in farming the human race for information is hard to know. Gaius and Caprica 6 were conversing at the end of the series about how things will turn out this time and how it might be different, so it could be possible that they're not exactly farming us for information but they could also be guarding us should we grow into something more. 

It may also be true that when the 5 came together they may have been granted access to this knowledge but failed because Galen Tyrol killed Tory Foster. But we'll never know. 

All in all I LOVED the show. I was extremely worried about the shows ending since I saw a few threads here and there (I didn't read them) about how people were angered by how things ended. I actually loved the ending I think it's great that different people seem to be interpreting the ending differently. However I think I'm fairly confident that I got the ending pretty much pegged.

Throughout BSG lore, the Greek gods are mentioned.  They are the religion of the twelve colonies.  Then I thought 12 colonies, 12 Cylon models.... 12 Greek gods.  What if each model corresponded to a Greek god?  I think number 6 represents Aphrodite because of the way she uses sexuality to manipulate people.  One is Zeus because of the way he commands the group.  Boomer might be Athena, just because that was her tag on Galactica.  3 or 5 could be Hermes.  The list goes on.  But it makes a certain kind of sense, how they would correspond.  Just some interesting food for thought.

There are also 12 titans in Greek lore, might be relevant.  Titans being a less refined group, i dunno just thought it was interesting",,False,self,t5_2qlvu,False,,,True,t3_10qvq5,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/10qvq5/i_recently_had_a_startling_thought_about_the/,

So we're going to start our own drinking game. My suggestions:

Take one drink anytime:


- Someone says ""Godsdamnit!""

- Laura Roslin takes off her glasses

- Helo looks bewildered

- ""Frak!"" is said


Take two drinks anytime:


- Tigh smiles

- Someone mentions what a great pilot Starbuck is

- Starbuck hits Apollo

- Apollo hits Starbuck


Take three drinks anytime: 

- Adama destroys a model tall ship

- Tigh and Starbuck get along

Baltar and Six enter the Opera House, and this music starts. Six talks about ""the music of life."" My first time through the series, I totally missed the significance of this.

Rewatching it now, I immediately notice that the theme that forms the base for the Opera House music is almost identical to the theme that forms the base for All Along the Watchtower. Bear McCreary is a musical genius.

(Spoilers)",trevdak2,55,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/1ibae7/met_michael_trucco_anders_and_tahmoh_penikett/,"First of all, both of them are awesome and nice. It was great to see a BSG actor on the east coast.

Some interesting facts I learned:

* The sets were mostly real-scale and HUGE with minimal greenscreen. Both Helo and Anders very rarely had to do anything with green screen. The CIC and hallways in the Battlestar were so expansive that Tahmoh actually got lost in them and had to call for help to find his way out.

* Trucco found out he was going to be a cylon only just before filming the episode where it's revealed. Aaron Douglas spoiled it for him before he could finish reading the script, (""with a shit-eating grin on his face""). Trucco called Ron Moore and asked what was up with that, and Moore responded ""Yeah, I know. Weird, isn't it?"" as if he had no control over it either.

* The toughest scenes for Helo to film were season one having freezing rain poured on him in Caprica, or shooting Athena so she could rescue Hera (Rapture, S3E12), or the scene where he and Tyrol rescue Athena from being raped. His favorite scenes were running and gunning with Katee in season 1.

* The toughest scenes for Anders were sitting in the tub as a Hybrid at the end of season 4... He had to do 3 hours of makeup at the beginning of the day, and 1 hour to get out of makeup at the end of the day. This was towards the end of filming so a lot of people were giving their teary goodbyes and he had to sit in makeup. The goo was unpleasant and all he could wear was ""a peach-colored g-string"". His favorite episodes were the first ones and the last ones because they were bookends on such a major point in his life. He gave a great anecdote of Edward James Olmos (Bill Adama), being the patriarch of the group, pulling everyone together and saying ""This is going to be the best frakkin show you ever do"". Trucco did a perfect EJO impression.

* Helo wasn't originally written in to box in the boxing episode. He had to go complain to the producers three separate times before they stuck him in there and let him put his Muay Thai experience to use.

* Anders wasn't totally sure why he was stuck in a viper for a few episodes, but he thought it was totally friggin awesome.

* Since he spent almost the entire first season on a separate set, Tahmoh was a bit of an outsider with the rest of the cast for a little while.

* Michael Trucco didn't actively avoid watching the shows on air, but he didn't go out of his way to watch them either. He hasn't watched it at all since it aired.

* Some girl asked Tahmoh ""whether Adama would have killed Cally if he found out if she was leading the resistance against him."" Tahmoh and the entire audience had no clue what she was talking about. If anyone could shed some light on this I'd love to hear it.

I saw the original BSG movie and like it but while the new series was running I had never heard of it. When people would refer to BSG I thought they were talking about the original movie and series and had no real interest in it. That is until I saw the new series on Netflix and thought I'd give it a shot. I just have to say what a great sci-fi experience. It was a well acted, well shot and well written epic adventure. 
I just browsed this thread for a few minutes and noticed quite a few people calling for another series or some other form of rehashing. I think that would be a horrible mistake. It was a beautiful story with a beginning, middle and end. Watching some other story line within the BSG universe would feel like a waste since you know the final chapter. 
The ending was satisfying and a conclusion in all senses of the word. I don’t know why you would want to try and add to it. I know this is all just opinion and you can disagree all you want, but if I had a seat at the Quorum I would vote to leave it as it is and appreciate a modern epic science fiction adventure.

The missing three will give you the five who have come from the home of the 13th. (Anders is there, and the Hybrids are aware of Ellen's existence on the ship. This is to establish the suceeding pronouns.)

You are the harbinger of death, Kara Thrace. (Kara's death and rebirth foreshadows the deaths of the Final Five)

You will lead them all to their end. (Based on the fact that the last multiple noun is the final five, the pronoun 'them' is the final five. Refering to the final five, Kara leads them to the end of their race, the first biological cylons. Also refers to the end of human and cylon races as they genetically merge)

End of line. ( Computer talk, never mind my crazy ramblings. ~~The end of the journey for both races. Hybrids 'see' jumps, which are the bending of space and time to move in a straight line through the folds of the galaxy. End of line = end of jumps.~~)

Any thoughts?

Edit: New thought on the harbinger of death part. Was Kara's death, or actually her rebirth the last one in the timeline of the show? I think it was, but I've clearly been wrong before.

I'm freaking drained, physically and emotionally. I feel a little empty after investing so much in this show for the past  couple of weeks. There hasn't been a show that sucked me in and made me care about the characters like BSG.

I've spent the last 3 hours reading posts on this subreddit and finding articles and videos about the series to fill the time. I guess I'm in the minority here since I really enjoyed every single episode of season 4 and the ending. I teared up in the final episode a few times, Bill Adama and Laura's relationship really affected me for some reason, probably because they are both such great actors.

My favorite characters probably in this order:
- Adama (of course)
- Starbuck (actually kind of liked her ending, will explain later)
- Helo and Athena

Although I tried to stay away from spoilers, I did read a couple of minor ones, no big deal. When it comes to Starbuck, I thought I was smart when I deduced that her dad is Daniel; apparently that's been debunked by the writers. Even still, I don't mind leaving that a little too open ended.

Overall, awesome show. It's going to take me a while to get over it.

I get what they were trying to do with it, the whole social commentary/religious thing, but I mean, seriously? Your decision, after all this time fighting for the survival of the human race, is to 

######""break the cycle"" by taking all of your spaceships and *flying them into the sun*, then setting off on foot to wander around in the wilderness until you find somewhere to pitch a tent?

######Most of the reason I loved the shit out of this show is how *real* everything seemed. I was blown away at points with how exceptionally the society in the fleet was developed, and how balls-on accurate everything seemed. Honestly, at points it felt like a documentary about the future history of the human race. Or a dramatic re-enactment of it. Stop reading this paragraph, it's getting stupid. Moving on. 

######Logically, the ending makes no sense at all. At the end of the show, there were almost 40,000 survivors, right? Most of these people were born and raised in cities, then spent a few years(?) living inside spaceships. There is absolutely zero chance that more people would survive out in the unexplored wilderness than would survive inside their damn spaceships. *This is an uncharted planet!* I mean, for a group of people so defined throughout the show by their tendency to disagree with each other, they sure went along with that shitty plan pretty quietly. 

######Not to mention that almost none of the insane character development that took place over four seasons got resolved! Gaius and Caprica got their ending as Adam and Eve, seeing as (according to that brief bit in the present where they show the news article about the human remains) they apparently were the starting point for most of the human race. But a bunch of people were just totally left out.

Please tell me someone agrees with me. There's just so much *wrong* with this ending. It was an awful way to end an otherwise incredible show.",,False,self,t5_2qlvu,True,,,True,t3_pj2v0,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/pj2v0/just_finished_battlestar_and_im/,

I love the storyline - the BSG being humanity's last remants on a journey to find the fabled Earth... it oozes drama and a space-opera genre setting which keeps me grounded in the tangible while still allowing me to suspend my disbelief.

But even as I'm finishing my second time through the series, I can't help but feel a little disgruntled at the execution.
I remember reading about how the writers refused to drag it out and milk it for more seasons like some other shows (cough *SG-1*cough), but I really wish it didn't feel so rushed.  ######The ending felt so... artificial. They spend 3 and a half seasons depicting the search for the 13th colony, and when they find out what happened to it, the ship falls apart and within a few episodes, by a stroke of plot-device magic they find a habitable planet that, supposedly, we currently inhabit. And don't even get me started on glaring holes in logic and unanswered questions. Why didn't they treat Roslyn with the half-cylon blood a second time? What is the deal with Starbuck, why do they leave her so shrouded in mystery?  Where did she go when she ""died?"" 

And that's not all. When I go from season 3 or 4 to season 1, I feel like I'm watching an entirely different show. The transition is too rapid. I realize this is supposed to illustrate how people change,  but honestly it feels like the writers started caving under pressure and then snapped back, or else they were making it up as they went, or else lost funding and just tried to tie it off as neatly as they could. I liked the ending, I thought it was brilliant and made most of the loose ends not matter so much... but they are still loose ends. And it does feel like there was a gap or a redirect or something not planned from the beginning that really messed with the story. And I don't just mean all the frustrating things that happen in season 4... does anyone else resonate with this?

Honestly this show is the only one I can think of that made me tear up at the end, specifically around the ""So much life"" point. Closing out with this show was/is almost heartbreaking.
When I started I had no idea what to expect. I'm no stranger to sci-fi, but for the most part I had limited myself to ""campy"" shows like SG-1, SGA, and a little Star Trek. Of course I've seen SGU, but this isn't the time or place to discuss everyone's issues with that show. The intensity blew me away. I was completely and totally unprepared for any of it.

I really enjoyed it but no one i know watches it so i have a few meandering thought and questions. this is all off my head so it probably wont make a lot of sense.... **spoliers ahead by the way**

Does anyone know if the writers had a similar situation to the writers of Lost? I.e they had an idea of what they were going to do, but they got told to add a couple more seasons in the middle so then they had to flesh it out on the hoof? It seemed that in the middle they were just making stuff up.

* Kara - I'm sorry but i hated her for i reckon.... 90% of it. 
* Sam - Best Pyramid player in the 12 colonies gets beaten by Starbuck first time they meet. C-Bucks rule! (yer right...) Why did nothing happen to him when he shot Felix in the leg! 
* Boomer - i thought that her and Athena's were 2 of the more interesting characters and not enough was done to explore/blur the lines between human/cylon. It's like they forgot all about Boomer's character for 2 seasons and then only brought her back for a bit to take Hera away.
* Bill Adama - thought it was ridiculous how he kept Tigh on after he found out he was one of the final 5. There is a photo in the best of r/bsg about how it's more realistic that Star Trek. Well yes probably, but Lee held about every title of authority in the series and broke god knows how many rules that by the end it was just unbelievable. 
* Tigh - my most hated character to be honest. basically spent the entire show gurning and drinking and not a lot else. Why did Six have sex with Tigh?!?
* Baltar - thought he was a parody of himself for most of the show. I really liked his story when he thought he was losing his mind and if Six was real or not, but when he became a religious leader....come on. 
* Lee - get some better fitting suits.
* survivors on other planets. So Sam et al were some of the resistance on Caprica...ok. firstly i thought there was a full radioactive fallout. k, ill look past it some people survived on what was basically a pretty untouched world. where there only 50 survivors on the entire planet and that's it and they all found themselves. what about the other colonies?
* Frakking is without doubt the most annoying word. Every time it was said it made me lose my immersion in the story and just think it was stupid. I know it was probably done to make it slightly more family friendly (airing/certifications) but just made me wince every time. 
I think i mentioned above that i thought hte best story lines were the ones that blured what it meant to be human. i.e. Boomer coming to terms that she might be Cylon. or Six's love for Baltar and i think more should have been done to pursue that. Id did seem that the final 5 (well 4) came to terms with being Cylon pretty easily compared to Boomer in series 1. those 5 being the final 5 didnt fit too well for me to be honest. 


Oh man there were loads of other things that i have already forgotten. rant over.... im so sorry for the garbled mess above. I really liked the show overall, but i loved the first season and by the end i felt that it didnt live up to what i thought it was going to be. Still one of the best out there though so im not trying to overly knock it! 

bsg love. So say we all.

Edit: another thing I don't get.  So why did the final 5 conceal who they were from themselves? It was of no benifit for themselves. I know it was touched on but how did Saul have hair when he was younger, at what age does he ressurect? Do Cylons age? How did he get to Caprica to join the military/meet bill? Someone must have dropped him off there once. Maybe im looking into it too much....",,False,self,t5_2qlvu,1375987369.0,,,True,t3_1jygh3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/1jygh3/so_i_have_just_finished_watching_all_series_in/,

Lots of nice quotes and general over view of what he talked about. This part in particular was especially interesting to me:

*Olmos finds inspiration for his roles in an unlikely place: music. “Music is the key for me, to develop characters,” he said. “I have to find my music before I can actually even start to work.”*

It went on to say that he was shopping in Vancouver and randomly picked up an album of a woman named Deva Premal, and that was what he needed to connect with Adama and the story.

*“I played it from the very first day I got it, to the very last day that I worked on Battlestar Galactica. I played it every single day, seven days a week, to stay inside my character and to keep Adama alive and well.”*

Thanks to Wikipedia I learned that Deva Premal creates ""meditative spiritual New Age music which puts ancient Sanskrit mantras into atmospheric contemporary settings."" hmmm, Sanskrit? But isn't there Sanskrit in BSG?

After some simple googling, I learned that the [main title of the UK version is in Sanskrit](http://tviv.org/Battlestar_Galactica_(2003)/Season_1_Soundtrack), and that [funeral service at the end of Miniseries](http://en.battlestarwiki.org/wiki/Language_in_the_Twelve_Colonies) has a prayer in Sanskrit. There could be more connections but those were 2 that I found quickly.

So anyway, [&gt;here&lt;](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6zCF358Aa4) is a youtube link to one of her songs. It definitely has, to me, a BSG-vibe. Sounds like it could have a home in the show, and it was interesting listening to some of her other pieces and imagining EJO using it to ""channel"" Adama.

My gf and I are rewatching this show. I forgot how amazing it was. I finished watching the show the first time before I realized the internet was good place to talk about shit.

About the ending, most people were a lot more pissed than I was. I could accept the mystical nature of it even if I didn't really get how it worked. 

But now rewatching the show I have suddenly realized the ending does make a lot more sense than I realized. 

Reason I ask is because we just watched the infamous ""Maelstrom"" episode. And it was during this episode that I realized what I think happened to Starbuck. It is pretty clear that she did in fact die during this episode. It is also fairly apparent that the Cylons intended her to come back and bring them to Earth. 

Basically my theory is that all humans have some basic capacity to receive projections. Six claimed only Gaius could because he was some kind of angel, but that was just the Cylon's religious interpretation of the fact that he held a special place in society due to his celebrity and scientific knowledge. So Kara's hallucinations were actually projections, and when she returned after Maelstrom, she was basically a projection into the human's minds because they wanted her to guide the humans to Earth. Some of the Cylons always wanted this, but not all of them, which is kind of why the Cylon Civil War happened. Over time they were more motivated to ally with humans than conquer them.

There is another theory that says the Starbuck's visions were actually Daniel in disguise. Daniel being the Cylon that was ""boxed"" before the beginning of the show. One of the models escaped boxing and knocked up Kara's mom somehow. That would explain all the talk of her being special, and it would also explain why her mom was so bitter and angry (other than being a raging alcoholic). She was part of the fleet and she got pregnant by a Cylon and she would feel angry at herself about that. So then when Kara died in Maelstrom her half Cylon-ness allowed her to download. That would also explain the whole piano player thing post-Earth. The problem is this doesn't explain why she just disappeared in the last episode. Nor does it explain why her father would appear in a vision to her as a different Cylon and not just explain it to her. But maybe she did see that, and that was why we saw a little girl looking up at someone just before she died.

So it's gotta be some combination between these two. What are the prevailing ideas? Any links ppl can point me too? And don't just say it didn't make sense or the writers just made shit up. I really don't think that's what happened, and I also don't think that's nearly as fun in appreciation of the show.

At first it was slightly above average in quality to me--some of the characters really got on my nerves. I warmed up to a few right away and loved them throughout the series--Bill Adama and Saul Tigh were my two favorites, and Starbuck was my least favorite. But once Season 1 was winding down everything was cranked up to 11 beyond that point.

The premise was so *bleak*. It's probably the most depressing show I've ever seen. Throughout seasons 1 and 2 I had multiple theories going around in my head about how the Cylons had somehow mathematically predicted everything and were ten steps ahead of Galactica and the fleet at any given time. It felt like watching a fly with his wings cut off scurry around in a jar, oblivious to a ten-ton hammer danging a few feet above waiting to crush it.

I've never hated anything more in a fictional setting than I hated the Cylons. They were the *perfect* antagonist. They pushed all of my buttons, and that seething hatred lasted throughout the whole series. It's frakkin' scary how well those writers pitched them as villains. I don't want to get into any specifics about events during the show for fear of spoiling anything, but my opinion did change about the Cylons after a while. I realized I couldn't hate all of them.

So now I'll move onto my questions. I have been curious about the original BSG series. I'm aware of some differences between the two series, but does anyone prefer it over the re-imagining? Are there some things it does better than the 2004 show? Is it considered kosher to forego watching it or should I make an effort to try and watch it?

It's big, it's got big ideas, and covers a lot of ground in four seasons. However, it's the small moments, episode to episode, that make the show great. It's these moments that really showcase the amazing talent that worked on this series (both writers and actors). 

Here's a few of my favorite moments. What are some of yours?

######I love chubby Apollo. It's so bad, it's good. Always makes me smile. His jumprope is obviously some magical artifact that should be passed down through the generations. 

######I love Saul Tigh. He could easily be a one-dimensional character, but winds up being very well developed. I love that he is serious about committing to something. When he decides to be Bill's friend, he sticks with him no matter what. When he decides to kill traitors, he kills his wife. When he decides to drink, he drinks all the alcohol. I especially enjoyed watching him take down Bulldog. A cranky old drunk beats the hell out of a man that has been doing push-ups in a cell for years. 

######When Laura tells Bill to 'Open to page 61'. Lots of subtle things in that scene that add another layer of humanity to two of the strongest characters in the show. 

######Laura's response to the request for surrender. God damn, this woman is amazing. Her well of resolve runs deep, but we know she has limits. At this point, she thinks she has lost everything that matters to her, and she just gives Gata &amp; Zerrik the finger. 

######All of the scenes where Bill &amp; Saul are either laughing hysterically or beating the hell out of each other. You really get a sense of their relationship outside of the CIC. 

######When Starbuck rescues Apollo from the mutineers in the hangar bay. It's an epitomical moment for Starbuck. Any other time in a situation like this, everyone backs down. Starbuck shoots people. I love it.

######Gata's interview for the documentary. It's so contrary to everything else we've seen about him. Yet, it works. ",,False,self,t5_2qlvu,False,,,True,t3_ndycl,http://www.reddit.com/r/BSG/comments/ndycl/my_favorite_moments_spoilers/,

&gt;Galen Tyrol got one of the worst lots in all of Battlestar Galactica. First it turns out that the woman he loves is a Cylon. Then she gets killed just when he starts to resolve his feelings toward her. Then a twin with her memories shows up, but is in love with another man. Then he narrowly escapes a death sentence. Then he has recurring dreams where he’s committing suicide. Then he has a tumultuous marriage with the woman who killed his former love. Then he finds out that he’s a Cylon. Then he thinks his wife committed suicide. Then he finds out she was sleeping with another man and that he’s not the father of the child he’d been raising. Then his former love comes back, only to dupe him into helping her abscond with a child. Finally, he discovers that his wife was actual killed by one of his fellow “Final Five” Cylons. It’s a pretty rough go, to say the least.
