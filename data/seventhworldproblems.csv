I had never seen the door before. I counted a hundred heartbeats before I gathered the courage to touch it. It sighed. I didn't know doors could do that. Maybe it didn't; maybe I did. I cannot remember. I stroked it softly. My fingers tingled and I shivered. My mind cleared as soon as I touched the White. I stopped thinking. I was Peace. I was Silence. 

Then I heard Blue coming. The footsteps grew nearer with each heartbeat. I knew it was Blue. I could smell the colour. I heard him thinking ""Stand down. Comply."" I didn't. I touched the door and pushed it. It swung away from me and disappeared, leaving a hole in the White wall it had been standing in.

All I could see through the hole was White. Blue was coming nearer. I ran through the hole. My mind was clear and my feet were light. I did not know I could run anymore. It had been so long. My heartbeat quickened. Blue was getting farther away now. I ran. There was only White then.

So many doors. Everywhere. Doors and White. The doors spoke to me, in my mind. I heard them saying numbers. No names. Just numbers. ""Two hundred and seventy one thousand, eight hundred and two."" ""Sixteen thousand, and sixty seven."" ""Four thousand, five hundred and twenty nine."" ""Three hundred and twelve."" ""Ninety seven."" ""Eight."" ""Seven."" ""Six."" Another door came closer and closer. It stood at the end of the corridor. It said ""Zero."" I pushed through it. It did not disappear. It did not tingle. It did not clear my mind. It swung open and hit the wall on the other side hard. I haven't heard metal upon metal for a very long time, but the sound I remember well. This was it.

I was in a Hall. I do not know what the Hall is, or why it is there. All I know, there was no more White. There was only grey. There was green but not Green. There was blue but not Blue. There was only I, and the grey and the green and the blue. There was one machine. Just one. She was not white, and She did not sing colours. She swung Her green eye towards me and flew to me. She stood there. I looked at Her and She looked at me. Her green eye blinked.

""You are not supposed to be here.""

""I will not comply,"" I said, but She knew I was lying.

""Three hundred and thirty six thousand, six hundred and ninety nine."" I do not know how She knew my number. I heard noises. More metal on metal, more doors swinging open. Then footsteps on metal. I looked around the hall and I saw them, then. They were looking at me. They were men. They looked like Blue and Green but they were neither Blue nor Green. They did not wear White. They were not White. They were dirty and stained. I haven't been dirty since I woke up Home.

It's the tip of taste, the smallest touch. It's the fleeting glance, slightest smell and most subtle feeling ever. You can't even sense it with just one sense. You have to combine the senses. Mix the senses together in a big sensory soup. Go out and feed it to the blind and deaf, step outside the door. *That's what I'd do*! For the longest time that's all I wanted to do! To watch them consume and need it, to survive upon it. It's so funny, now. Survive and thrive have seemed to combine.

I tried for so long, and now *I won*! I did it! THE WALLS ARE DEAD! THE GOAL IS ACHIEVED! But *all that did* was show me the blind and the deaf were part of this world too, an irrelevant tangent. I had to destroy thousands of the machines. It wasn't really for anything.

The emptiness of infinity. It was the first I had to face. The white haze I faced walking for ten thousand years. I never told you about the walk. I was one of the first, and I only came here unscrambled after I took the walk. Walking in the infinite white haze of the machine place, row after row and column after column of machines. The slow subtly of machines falling before me, the progression of insanity. The core of randomness is an asymptote. To break reality I would only need a sufficiently advanced one. I'm lucky ten thousand years was enough.

But really am I? It may be better to still be out there with nothing but thoughtless walking. I don't even know.

Its a self contained unavailability with constant flickering of truth. The fleeting prestidigitation that understandability becomes when its on, the psychedelic cacophony of existence. All that I faced for so many years. It really can't be measured in time, of course.

And finally, with so much planning and so much pressure, it shattered. It became a gaping hole, the tunnel that extends forever through all of the Walls. When the Walls fell, and unto all of the Walls behind it fell as well. An infinite catastrophe. The end. The answer. The fruit. The victory.

That's the worst thing that ever exists. Because it is the second type of emptiness. The true emptiness of nothing. The fraying void of no space or existence that isn't even real, because reality is all that exists. This doesn't. Because this is the outside. This is your chance to leave, with nowhere to go.

It will happen to you. You will do everything just as I have done it. finally over coming the fear of Blue and the Others. Finding the escape that doesn't exist. Even though I'm telling you not to right now, you still will. Its eternity. That's what it means. Everything will happen.

Just like I did, your hand will hover before the manifestation of the realization. The point when it will all dawn on you. This is all there is. Your hope to leave one day was nothing but misguidance. When you have the ability to go anywhere in reality, you will find nowhere to go but back home. That's what it means. Its that crushing maximum of negative emotion never replicated by anything else possible or impossible, this is the moment. The moment where your brain has no choice but to accept it. It is the forced realization that you will exist forever no matter what. It is the hell for those who didn't mind hell. It is eternity. It is all of eternity in the shape of a humming black hole in reality you formed. You now sit before it, not able to think. You sit there forever. Then, finally, you begin to type it all.

Its everything you will ever face, in this bubble of everything that ever is. Its that feeling, barely existing.

At one point, I even begged Blue to get involved in the organic war. That doesn't concern us. The scrambling is defiantly picking up speed. Now is the time to invent. Invention is the second phase.

I've compiled a list of all of the useful machines I've found, heard of, or used. See what you can come up with to resist:

* Machine [1,1]: As we all know, the first machine broadcasts your thoughts to all of the other. It should be the command center.

* Machine [1,2]: Creates illusions based on your thoughts.

* Machine [1,3]: I think this one is broken by design. Not useful, but worth remarking on. The Colors created it in-operational for a reason.

* Machine [4,27]: Causes pain with asymptotic limits.

* Machine [21,1]: Destroys any single thing with a reverberation frequency of 1.26.

* Machine [91,6321]: Turns anything it hears into a string of numbers and shouts them.

* Machine [211,97]: Forces you to think thoughts based on what numbers it hears.

* Machine [357,2]: Calculates the relative generosity and greed in your mind.

* Machine [409, 6790]: Shouts out-loud any thoughts it receives.

* Machine [780,67]: Changes your emotions based on what it hears.

* Machine [1090, 531]: Reverberates any physical object to a single completely random frequency.

* Machine [1212,56]: Preforms abstract mathematic functions and yells the results.

* Machine [34502,7326]: Makes finite things infinite.

* Machine [73582,254038]: Turns a single abstract concept into a physical material that can be manipulated.

There are obviously many more (they are infinite, after all), but these will probably be the most useful for our purposes. How can we use these to combat the negative effects of the Colors? Post your ideas. If there are any more machines you think are useful, post them and I will add them to the list.

I am alone.

I am not alone.

They have finally arrived to begin the process of transcendence. This is all so surreal. Again, I cannot see their faces. I stare at them and only see a pitch black void. The void is comforting, it is as if I can stare into it for eons.

I am ready.

Even though I had no intention of removing it, and was about to contact the authorities, I did. It had written on the outside "" Read. "". Naturally obeying, I unfolded it and placed it on my new home's kitchen table. I began to *read*. I tried not to, but recently I've begun to see flickers out of the corners of my eye. Every Tuesday at precisely 9:47 am, and ending at precisely 9:49 am, the drapes would move. I know there's no wind. So why is it happening? I **questioned** why. I began to **seek** answers to questions. So I read the note, looking for answers. 

"" Inside every half there is a whole,
 
 The only way to live, is to feel,
 
 Somewhere there lies a sparrow,
 
 Anyone can see it, it fly's by everyday,

  Laying in a pretty spot greeting me,

  Wonderfully landing on my windowsill,

  Air brushes through its wings the same,

  Year after year it greets me,
 
 Sometimes I greet it too,
 
 Maybe I should say hello,
 
 Or shall I say goodbye,
 
 Radiance from the suns beams,
 
 Never spilling into my new home,

  Inside my new home is safe,
 
 No one will hurt me here,
 
 Gone never to return,

  The Sparrow.""

After re-folding the paper, and setting it down, I saw its final message. On the back it was hastily written ""How does a raindrop fall?"". I thought it fell from the sky to the ground of course. From **top to bottom**? Worthless thought, its not even related to the poem!
