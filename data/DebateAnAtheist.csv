Abrahamic(? word idk) believers firmly say that God is Benevolent, Omnipotent, and Omniscient. I'll let this video do my arguing. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rC2Nvo_I3os&amp;list=UUupX3k88Z1cRYCDuCPrmxlg&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp

Everyone who agrees, contact Answers in Genesis and challenge Ken Ham to come here and debate us.  (I can't find contact info on their website.)  

Obviously, this is a better solution than The Science Guy debating Ken Ham:  Debating us doesn't get Ken Ham any notoriety or legitimacy since none of us are famous.

And last but not least:  Ken Ham doesn't NEED to debate The Science Guy (or any other real scientist) to get his clock cleaned.  I'm confident the users of /r/DebateAnAtheist can handle this easily.

Since Ken Ham likes to issue debate challenges (and then when they are not accepted by 'insert famous atheist in the news here' he crows about how they are afraid, etc.) let's call him out.

Join us here Ken, or admit yourself a coward.

It's atheism vs theism. When you make an argument for YOUR religion, it should be one that other religions can't make.

A good point towards debating your religion is probably not a question. ""If God doesn't exist, how do you explain-"" NO.

Another reason that particular example was bad is that you don't need an answer for everything. ""I don't know"" is a valid option.

Atheists don't hate God. They're not rebelling against him. Lacking appreciation for God's actions isn't really applicable. They don't worship Satan. They don't believe they're going to hell, or heaven for that matter. Jesus dying on the cross either didn't happen or doesn't matter.

How good something is doesn't matter when it comes to truthfulness.

Data can point in all different directions. Be very careful, especially when determining that one thing causes another.

If you have to somehow change or ignore large amounts of facts, laws, well-tested theories, or evidence in order to prove that your book or part of your book is merely POSSIBLE, you may want to reassess your beliefs.

Just because it's possible doesn't make it probable.

Giving a possible explanation for something doesn't make it evidence, and certainly not proof.

Evidence isn't always good evidence.

Remember, it takes outside influence to become religious. Agnostic atheism is the default belief of a child who has just gained the ability to make a conscious decision for themselves but has not put any thought into the matter yet. The important part to take from this is that the burden of proof lies with the one making the claim. If you're trying to prove your religion, it isn't up to the atheist to disprove it on their own.

Remember, that which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

Believing in something doesn't make it true. Liking something doesn't make it true. Being unable to be proved false doesn't make something true. The truth doesn't get made, the truth was there before you were.

Science and religion are not wholly incompatible unless your interpretation of your religion makes it that way. If you're going to try to say that science is wrong, you'd better come prepared. See also: extraordinary claims, extraordinary evidence.

People use science to figure out what is true, not to make a truth up. There's no bias for or against god. If the evidence existed, more people would believe it. Science doesn't ignite evidence, it uses it.

Belief isn't something you can just choose. If it is, then there's a problem in the way you believe things.

To you, your holy book is important and informative and true and holy. To us, it's a book.

What I propose is to upvote such posts so they show up in the front page showing them for their lack of research and the fact that almost 100% the time each of their points are challenged in a civil manner, multiple times from various points of view. Yet they almost always lack a reply by the OP.

1372575743.0,78,self.DebateAnAtheist,1hcs14,I Have Questions about Atheism.,oasker,92,14,140,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1hcs14/i_have_questions_about_atheism/,"Hello reddit,

I'm a Christian and I was hoping people here could help me better understand some aspects of atheism. I've watched countless debates with great atheist minds like Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Daniel Dennet, Lawrence Krauss, Peter Atkins...etc but I feel as though Im missing something. I've done my best to study all facets of both sides of the argument regarding the existence of God, but of course I can only see things through my own bias. I just want to make sure I dont have a case of ""confirmation bias"" syndrome, and if I do I'd like to be cured! 

Questions: 

1.) What scientific evidence does atheism present in the argument against God?

*I know to some this question will seem ridiculous, but it seems to me as though many arguments Ive seen atheist use begin with a scientific fact, and then make a philosophical leap that does not necessarily follow. Please be as specific as follow, syllogisms may help clear things up.


2.) What is the strongest philosophical argument against God's existence?


3.) What reason does an atheist have to behave morally?

*Note I am not saying an atheist CANNOT behave morally. I understand evolution is the origin for many atheists. I am more curious as to why an atheist who believed that would continue to act morally when at times it comes at the expense of their pleasure. I hope this does not sound too crude, but if morality is essentially relative and therefor pointless, why not just maximize the amount of pleasure that can be experience? (Again, I do not mean to draw straw men of atheist, please rebut me if my understanding is wrong.) 


4.) How would an evolutionary process lead to humans general goodwill toward one another and the species as a whole?

*The survival of the fittest mentality does not seem to fit here. Wouldn't the earliest species with this trait would not survive very long in a world that does not feel quite so compassionate?
 

5.) I've heard it said that religion is a product of evolution, but this seems counterintuitive to me. How and for what purpose would religion be implemented into the framework of evolution?

6.) Do you consider atheism a religion? Why or why not? 

*Dictionary.com defines 'religion' as such: 'a set of beliefs concerning the cause, nature, and purpose of the universe, especially when considered as the creation of a superhuman agency or agencies, usually involving devotional and ritual observances, and often containing a moral code governing the conduct of human affairs.'

*Note that the aspect of superhuman agencies are not required to qualify an ideological framework as a religion.



Thats all i have off the top of my head, all responses appreciated!

He sent me this.",iPoopedInYourHat,85,6,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/mfnaz/so_im_having_a_discussion_with_this_pastor_who/,"You asked a lot of questions that seem to indicate that you aren't familiar with the Christian responses them, so I'll provide some quick answers and then we'll take it from there to see if you're interested in going further:

1.  Your argument on the impossibility of God from omniscience doesn't follow because your argument is a straw man.  Premises 1 &amp; 2 of your argument are false as it pertains to the Christian God, thus your conclusion doesn't follow.  God's omnipotence is defined as God being able to do that which is consistent with His character and decrees.  This means that God cannot do some things:  (1) He can't deny Himself, (2) can't lie to His covenant people, (3) can't be tempted with evil, (4) can't cease to exist, etc.  Thus, omnipotence must be defined in accord with historic, Christian orthodoxy, otherwise you're just setting up a straw man.     

2.  Eutyphro's Dilemma has been answered for thousands of years by Christians, yet unbelievers still use this argument.  With all due respect, this tells us that atheists are failing to read Christian apologetic responses to their arguments:  http://www.str.org/site/News2?page=NewsArticle&amp;id=5236  Philosophically astute atheists (i.e., Graham Oppy, etc.) don't use these types of arguments because they've been refuted for centuries.

3.  ""Direct evil: such as God killing children throughout the bible."" - God doesn't ""kill children throughout the Bible"".  There are three places in Scripture where God commands the complete annihilation of a people group such that it would have included children:  Humanity (Gen. 6-9); the Canaanites (Deut. 20) and Amalekites (1 Sam. 15).  All of these texts are judgment texts wherein God brings judgment because the culture was so debauched that it was irreparable and it failed to heed God's call to repent.  See here for discussion, historical context, and explanation:  http://www.epsociety.org/library/articles.asp?pid=45&amp;mode=detail

4.  ""Evil by design: such as designing a planet which would produce natural disasters.""  - The world is the way that it is because our first parents told God to shove off; and He obliged.  This not only affected us morally, but affected the entire created realm; hence a fractured creation full of natural evil.  

5.  ""Second hand evil: A God who designs free-will has designed a potential and perhaps even a proclivity for his creation towards evil acts."" - First off, we don't have libertarian free will; we have free moral agency.  The two are not the same.  People are evil because our first parents told God to take a hike and that act plunged the entire creation into a mess.  Now people's moral agency is used for good or evil.  The problem wasn't God, the problem was humanity wanting to be God.    

Question:  If there's no God, where does your objective standard of good and evil come from by which you judge God in a world without an ultimate standard of good and evil?

6.  ""Also, the results of studies show that prayer is ineffective outside of the placebo effect."" - Documentation?  As a pastor, I have personally experienced miraculous answers to prayer many times such that it could not be explained via naturalistic mechanisms.

7.  ""What was God doing in the billions of years before humanity?"" - Existing.  Psalm. 90:2 

8.  ""Why is there so much extra space?"" - Not sure how this is relevant to the existence/non-existence of God, but Genesis 1 and Psalm. 19 provides some insight.  

9.  ""What was there before god?"" - This question begs the question by assuming God had a beginning because He's contingent upon something outside of Him for His own existence.  But God is a se.  Dawkin's arguments notwithstanding, God never had a beginning but necessarily exists.  

10.  ""What created god?"" - See above.

11.  ""If the Bible/Koran/insert-holy-text-here is not the literal word of god then all of it has to be discarded as a complete work of fiction."" - This is just a bare-naked assertion without any argument or question.  What do you mean ""the literal word of god""?  Do you think Christians read their Bibles in a wooden, literalistic fashion?  Some uninformed believers may do so, but all OT/NT scholars and students of Scripture read it in light of its cultural and historical background, genre, date of composition, etc.  The same principles used to interpret any ancient document should be used to interpret the Bible.  The fact that some believers don't interpret it this way doesn't mitigate against its truthfulness, it mitigates against the erroneous method the uninformed believer uses to read the ancient text.  

12.  ""Without the Bible there is no reason to believe that a god exists."" - Actually, your arguments presuppose things that could only be true if God existed.  Assuming logical realism, your attempt at using logic to refute the existence of God requires God to even attempt an argument.

13.  ""All of the theories we have work fine without invoking this unnecessary factor."" - This begs the question by assuming that God is unnecessary.  But that's the very question that remains to be answered.  Occam's razor only applies if we multiply entities unnecessarily.  What remains is for you to show that God is unnecessary instead of merely asserting it.

14.  ""The way I see it, all the people throughout history have had some form of god and this is the ONLY reason that religion exists today. It stems from a time when we were less intelligent but still had the fierce need to understand and is now a relic that should be discarded. The only reason it holds so many people back from thinking and acting is because it persuades people using fear.....our natural fear of death.  It is a complicated and unnecessary compensation for our common fear of death and the unknown.""  This is all question begging and mere assertions.  With all due respect my friend, assuming that ancient people were less intelligent betrays your ignorance of ancient people.  The languages and cultures of ancient peoples were often much more complex than anything we possess today.  This is why Greek students can take 3 years of New Testament Greek and still can't read through most of the New Testament without significant technical helps.  The OT teachers of the Law (Pharisees) would often memorize entire books of the OT in Hebrew and Aramaic and could quote entire chapters of Scripture in the original language right off the cuff.  The Greeks were just as sophisticated with their intellectual abilities as intinerant philosophers known as sophists would parade the countryside looking for opportunities to impress people with their ability to speak and debate with eloquence, rigor, and intelligence.  Ancient peoples didn't have modern conceptions of science, but they weren't ""less intelligent"".  Far from it.  

The existence of the divine has been held by all ancient and modern cultures simply because within our species, there is an incessant awareness of the divine.  This has been made obvious to us via the external created order and via an internal awareness of the divine as well as through a functioning conscience (Rom. 1:19-21; 2:14-15).  Evolutionary explanations for these faculties fail on many levels, but I don't have time to discuss those things now.

I'd be glad to get lunch with you sometime and chew the fat so that we can discuss these things at a greater level.  I used to be an atheist so I greatly appreciate and understand the atheistic/agnostic/skeptical mindset.  Take care my friend.  Thanks for the e-mail.

He gave me a piece of anti-gay literature while I was walking through Birmingham, UK to pay off a library fine. When I had the flier thrust into my hands and looked at the words on it, I couldn't help but object to it. I said ‘I don't agree with any of this at all’. He asked why, and the first thing I pointed out was the first bullet point had a wholly ridiculous assertion: Couples in ‘real marriages’ are less likely to have abortions than sam-sex couples. I told him how ridiculous this assertion was. The second point was that gay people could never raise a child well, and I asked why. I was very nervous.

His response was ‘common sense, isn't it?’ and I said ‘is it? why can't they bring up a child as well or you or me?’

And that's when the debate went into a wholly frustrating direction. He said that God made one man and one woman in the Garden of Eden. I said that Eden isn't a real place. He said to prove it, and I explained that we know that humans share common ancestry with the other species on Earth.


He asserted there was not a shred of evidence for evolution. I said that the fields of genetics, geographical zoology, geology, palaeontology and general comparative anatomy all provide overwhelming evidence for evolution. He gave me some macro/micro evolution crap, and I explained that those weren't scientific terms, and that macro-evolution is just evolution across 4 billion years. Then he asked for a single example of macro-evolution happening. I told him about how we understand on a molecular level the exact places at which mutations occurred that separated us from the other great apes. He said that all was doing was pointing out similarities between creatures genes. He said ‘I have atoms and so do stars. Does that mean I am evolved from stars?’ .... ‘Yes!’. Then he said ‘All of Shakespeare's works contain full-stops. Does that mean they evolved from one another?’ I said no, because they don't reproduce.

He replied that this was just an analogy. I told him it was a terrible analogy.

Then he repeated this argument but with cars and bikes both having wheels, therefore they evolved. He said that fruit flies share 99% of our DNA, but we are not related to the fruit fly. I said we are related to the fruit fly, and it's actually probably more like 60% of our DNA is shared with the fruit fly. He said that scientists had never been able to grow bacteria that was a new species because being a new species means to be unable to reproduce with one's own siblings. I told him that scientists had found gradual variation in bacteria lots of times, and that bacteria don't mate anyway.

So I mentioned palaeontology and how he could head down to the Natural History Museum and see lots of fossil evidence. He said there were no transitional fossils. I explained that all fossils are transitional, and the majority of the 250,000 extinct species we've discovered through fossils would have descendants who became modern species.

He said that this was just evidence for the great flood, and gave a load of other ‘geological evidence’ for the flood, which unfortunately I didn't really have a response for, not being a geologist. He then brought up the Cambrian Explosion, and I didn't have enough knowledge of this topic to comment either, rather just had to sit there and let him spew that this was ‘proof’ of creation, because it was at this point that there were ‘actual species’. I explained that throughout all of evolution, every organism was an ‘actual species’.

Then, he came out with a real fucking gem. ‘Prove that I have a grandfather’. I looked at him incredulously, and then explained methods I'd use to determine he had a grandfather, including simple deduction ‘All humans have parents. You are a human. You have parents. Your parents were human, they have parents. Parents parents are called grandparents, therefore you have a grandfather.’ and by suggesting looking at family history etc. Every time he just said ‘that's not proof, that's not proof’. I asked what the point was. He said if I couldn't even prove that he had a grandfather, how could I possibly have evidence that he was descended from simpler organisms? He said it was impossible for science to have evidence for anything. How he manages to function without accepting evidence for things like ‘stepping into traffic is dangerous’, I don't know.

Then he gave a crappy argument from irreducible complexity, which I explained was not a problem, and that the eye is just a REALLY well adapted light-sensitive cell. He said no simpler light sensitive cells exist. I explained that plants all respond to sunlight. He said this was impossible, as for light sensitive cells to evolve, the organism would already need to have vision (????).

Another little gem was that since Darwin was unaware of Mendel's work on genetics when he wrote *On The Original Of Species*, evolution couldn't possibly be true. I obviously explained that genetics *confirms* evolution, and just because Darwin had it before he knew of it, doesn't make Darwin wrong. He even said Darwin himself didn't believe in his own theory...

I occasionally tried to bring the discussion back to the homosexual rights thing, but he persisted saying that he would first prove the existence of the garden of Eden using ‘logic’. 

He brought out the Kalam Cosmological Argument. I responded that cause and effect happen only as a consequence of time, and that since time is a property of the universe, cause and effect doesn't necessarily happen *to* the universe — we can only be sure it happens *within* the universe, and that just because we don't know how the universe began, there's no reason to conclude ‘Wizard did it’. He said ‘how do you know time is a property of the universe?’ I explained that well supported theories based on real experimental and natural data like General and Special relativity show that time is affected by movement through space, gravity etc. He said ‘Argument from authority! You're just quoting Albert Einstein!!’ I explained it would only be an appeal to authority if I'd said that was true *because* Einstein said it. Rather, I was saying it was the best explanation because empirical evidence supports it.

Then he said ‘cause and effect does not need time’. I said ‘Yes it does.’ He said ‘NO! 4th Law Of Logic: Cause and effect!’ I said how can cause and effect possibly occur without time? He said ‘Easy. 1+1=2. That was cause and effect’. I said no it wasn't, it was just an abstraction.

At which point, I realised I should really leave the conversation there. I have never spoken to someone so frustratingly.... yeah. I knew he'd think he'd beaten me (especially considering he was a lot older than me, and tried to talk down to me quite a lot (he expected me to buy that Causality was the ‘4th law of logic’).

He shook my hand and said god bless.

I'm sorry, I needed to rant this to you. I'll probably fill in exposed gaps in my knowledge like the Cambrian Explosion.

am going to start by identifying myself, i've been brought as muslim, and am still muslim, i have doubted religions, and god, but my humble reasoning couldn't wrong them, especially god. 
what i want today, is to be taken as ME, don't argue with me following stereotypes, if you have something you doubt about MY believe, ask ME, don't take every thing you know from media, or terrorists and apply it to me, i wholeheartedly don't hate any atheist, never ever, and that is my islam.

so ask me anything, i'll respond as honestly as i possibly can, but i also expect you to be honest or there goes the last place i thought was cool, am not a scientist, nor a muslim expert, just a person who could never understand why all i've thought and learned about and thanks to my beliefs is related to peace, and why is it that everyone seems to not understand life as i PERSONALLY did. 

**edit** : aside from the lack of upvotes to this thread (T.T), i'd like to thank everyone for their good minded discussions, i just want to understand more, and you to understand more, and it's going pretty well i hope, thank you, really.

**edit** : here, i got the chance to speak ""even if not perfect english"" with people who are truly nice people, a thing one does not really face that much in real life, so to everyone, thank you, and am sorry if couldn't answer correctly to someone's question, but i want you to believe am trying as hard as i can to be as honest as possible, am only responsible for myself, so i want you to understand ME, and that there is at least someone who even though being muslim, will be proud to have friends like you.

**edit numba three!!!** : so many comments yet i have to see one without meaning, thank you, but remember this is me saying that am muslim and here i am, so when talking about muslim stereotypes be sure at least one isn't like them, ""but i know you know am not the only one"", either way, am only representing myself in an attempt of mutual understanding, i don't want to prove anything, i just want you to understand me, and me to understand you, so that we don't put each other in the bubble the media put us in, :D

**fourth an last edit** : tired as hell, i didn't expect this to get big, but am really thankful for everything, one or two people did not understand that my motif is ""good for humanity"" and that if someone shares this, he would be my friend regardless of his believes, so i just ask to be seen the same, and that there are many of us, just like another post in this subreddit about a christian guy who pretty much has the same views, the thread started well, until people started debating the existence of god and truth of islam with me, which is not my purpose nor am prepared or qualified to discus, go discuss that with isaac newton or some other religious scientist, or you might as well believe and put hand in hand with hitler ghenkis khan and stalin, after all they are not religious, they can't be bad, but am bad. :D

*so to finish this, i'd like to say that i was very happy with the feedbacks, and that people are actually willing to discuss regardless of how prepared they are to understand, and please, this worlds needs us to fight against people who are the source of problem, not fight against a religion that i ""assumed following some of your questions"" don't know anything about, i've really came in peace, and many of my kind and people want the same, the rest is on you, to believe in my intentions or not. i'll stop responding cause i already got my feedback, and mainly because am tired to be honest, but i'll still upvote everyone for as much as i could.

**okay, the fourth edit was not the last but this one** : this edit is caused by thing that actually caused me to get tired, as someone was going around the post, not believing someone muslim could ever be good, so, and because all i want is understanding i want to clarify his misconceptions and actually went to ask the people who brought me as a muslim to begin with, and here is what me father said : ""in times of war, you were killed for apostasy, just like traitors are killed now, it had actually nothing to do with sharia, but rather because someone who named himself muslim and ate from limited resources and lived between them, in a time of war, just switched the damn sides, and i guess maybe it's stupid to kill a muslim because he killed a non muslim while we have 10 thousand and them being far too many"" as for for now, a time where (discussing around tables) replaced war, at least for everywhere except american government who are controlled by mass profit companies, it is rather considered a crime to kill someone for something like that, same goes for gays, now we know they not like that because they chose not to populate the muslim nation, now we know it is genetic, and know as we are already 7billion on earth, it doesn't matter anymore. so what i deducted from my parents and the muslim scholars i trust in, most senseless killing in islam was done i war times, and generally for war causes. but again this is just to clear the mess, it is not my point, as crime or not, i'll never hate some for apostasy or homosexuality, let alone the killing, and this is me, so for the guy concerned about that, as for everyone, please, now focus on the main thing. understanding each other for a better tomorrow.

I'm writing this in an effort to break past this  wall and hopefully reach a common communication between myself, a Theist, and Atheists. To be clear; I don't actually care about being right, I care about finding commonality. I hold to the belief that the major thing standing between us is language, not belief. 

Just as a note: I don't adhere to Fundamentalism of any sort. Attempting to interpret or fit my words into a limited Fundmentalist context will lead us to a different place. If you don't think Religious texts can be interpreted any way but literally, then we will end up having a very different conversation, which will wind us back to this.

 There is a type of Atheist that will say ""Prove the existence of God."" My response to this is ""Prove the existence of Love."" I have recieved four rebuttles, all of which seem to fall short. 

 1) This is just word play. 

 This is the one I understand the least. Someone has experienced something that doesn't fit into their previous experiences, and, upon review and research of what that experience might be, they feel confident resting on the concept that is called ""God."" Other cultures have created different words for this concept, of course, but it makes sense that someone raised in a Western Culture would use Western words to describe their experiences. 

 This statement seems to be a deliberate misunderstanding of the term ""God"", or at least requires a fundamentalist adherance to a specific idea, or doctrine. 

 2) Love's just a concept or idea, and those don't exist. 

 I think this is an incredibly limited way of looking at our existence. Everything that has become physically manifest began as an idea. Even something as biologically basic as a baby begins as an idea first. Ideas and concepts shape us and guide us, and to say that they aren't a part of existence is extremely small minded. 

 3) We can observe the effects of Love, if not Love itself. 

 This is an outright duplication of an arguement for the existence of God that has been in use for several thousand years. Observing the effects of God has been in the theories of almost all Theologians throughout the entire existence of the concept of God. If we accept this arguement for Love, then we should accept it for God as well. 

 4) Love is a chemical reaction that we can observe, and have done tests on. 
 
 This is the most common rebuttle, and also the most interesting to me. The assertion is that there have been scientific tests done on humans which show, explicitly, that love is created through a chemical reaction. 

 Now, my first reaction is ""Can I see these tests?"" I've looked around for them myself, to no avail, and no one has been kind enough to link them to me. This forces me to speak from a place of admitted ignorance about these tests, so I can only percieve what might have occurred. 

 I imagine that they connect someone to a series of brain imaging equipment and take note when that person claims to experience the sensation of Love. I'll give this test the benefit of the doubt and assume that what the subject claimed to be Love is actually Love. 
 
 It strikes me that if we accept that Love exists, using this scientific method, then the exact same procedure should be able to be used to prove the concept of God. We should be able to connect someone to a series of brain imaging equipment and take note when that person claims to experience the sensation of God. 

 If we can prove the existence of Love this way, shouldn't we also be able to prove the existence of God in the same manner?

I originally posted this in AskReddit, and was told that decorum demanded I repost it here. This is the original text that I posted in the wrong forum:

I hope this does not come off as offensive, because I genuinely don't understand, but would like to. My understanding of love is that it comes from the soul, and my understanding of the dogma of atheism is that there is no soul. If everything human beings experience is the mere byproduct of hormones, how can genuine love exist?
Edit: I regret using the term dogma, since it is distracting everyone from the question. I actually googled it first and got ""A principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true,"" and figured it did not have to be a religious belief, but just an unequivocably true belief.

EDIT:

The tenets of my pretend theology are, but are not limited to the following:

God exists omnipotently, omnisciently, and omnibenevolently. God built the world to operate on natural processes. God only affects any life through these natural processes, never intervening. God exists as an infinite being on which all things are contingent.

The bible was inspired, not dictated, so people wrote the best they could with the lens they were given. Because of this, some things in the Bible may be erroneous. The bible should mainly act as a set of experiences to learn from, weighing all hardships and biblical joy by individual merit.

Morals should also be determined by individual merit.
Prayer is irrelevant. Chaos is a natural force in the universe. People exist not as a special creature, but merely as a microscopic cog in a cosmic mechanism, churning out all possible realities infinitely, with no clear beginning or end.

But don't atheist themselves deny the legitimacy of these religions based on the same exact line of reasoning? and if so wouldn't that make atheists just as ignorant? I mean at least i can understand agnostic, but atheism seems almost just as culty and filled with assumptions and selective interpretations based on the bible. I know i did a poor job of explaining my question but please only reply if you understand my question...

I mean, you are rejecting something because of the way someone else selectively decides to take literally because they have made horrible selections. The text itself isn't so bad, you don't read any other ancient text and get upset that it doesn't seem literally true. Why do so with the Bible. Why must everyone take it so literally.

To be honest I have mixed feelings about it. Which is most likely because I might not fully understand it. A really, really short summary on what I got from it is that while our brain has the “freedom” to make a decision, the decision is predetermined by the constraints. We only feel like we have free will. It is an illusion.

But at the same time I think this capability of our brain to select what it deems to be the best option is indistinguishable from the notion of free will.

I agree with Sam on a lot of this, and he's mostly right about everything. So I'm just wondering what are all of your thoughts on this, and if I'm wrong about anything that may be preventing me from understanding and fully agreeing with free will being an illusion as a whole?

He ends this saying ""The illusion of free will is itself an illusion.""

------

&gt;**I understand that people make a choice**

Is that choice free? Why do you do the things you do? Do you recognize that you have been influenced and changed by every experience you have had during your life? Do you recognize that every experience you have had was causally dependent on the circumstances that you were born into? If you were born at a different time and a different place and to different parents you would have had an entirely different set of experiences and they would have influenced you completely differently and due to this you would be a completely different person. In fact, this is exactly why people are all different. We are who we are due to the experiences that we have had which are all due to the circumstances that we were born into which none of us had any control over.

We don't have the type of free will that you think we do, we are all shaped by the environment that we inhabit throughout our lives and that was determined by when where and to whom you were born.

&gt;**When Adam was created there was no sin.**

By this surely all you mean is that no one had sinned yet... big deal. No one had flown in an airplane yet either.

&gt;**Adam was incapable of sin because there was no way to do it besides the one commandment that God had for him, ""do not eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil"".**

So... he was capable of sin then...

&gt;**Now we will be made totally clean when we enter heaven because of Jesus and there will be no tree to eat from so we will be incapable of sinning.**

Why was the tree there to begin with? Didn't God create the garden? Didn't God put the tree there? Then didn't God actually temp Eve, not the snake? The tree didn't have to be there, did it? Isn't Satan just a tool used by God, a scapegoat, a fall guy? Wasn't it actually God that tempted Eve to sin, after telling her not to. Wasn't it God that did not create Eve with the knowledge of good and evil, knowledge that is necessary to know that it was wrong to eat the apple, that it was wrong to disobey God? How could Eve know it was wrong to disobey God if she did not possess the knowledge to determine right from wrong, which was imparted to her only after eating from the tree?

&gt;**so we will be incapable of sinning.**

So we won't sin only because we won't have the opportunity to? Is that really meaningful? God gave us the opportunity to sin on Earth by placing the tree (and the snake) in Garden, but he won't give us the opportunity to sin in Heaven? Is our will free if our circumstances are designed to restrict us? If we are born in a prison cell do we have freedom? Does it matter if we would sin or not if we can't possibly do so?

&gt;**God punishes people because they're guilty.**

God created us, and he created the garden, and he tempted Eve by placing the tree and the snake in the garden. God knew before he created us that Eve would sin, he didn't have to put the tree in the garden but he did on purpose, and so He caused Eve to sin on purpose, and so he caused the ""fall of man"" on purpose, and so He caused all sin on purpose, and so he purposely made people to be guilty, and so he purposely made people so that he could punish them.

&gt;**It's totally fair.**

It's not at all fair if you consider the story you're telling me in the context of the attributes that you apply to God and if you think about it for more than a minute.

&gt;**The difference is that we as Christians are spared not only because we follow him but because the law is that because of sin you must die.**

He made the law, He made sin, and He made us... He engineered this whole song and dance to occur exactly as it is occurring. He made the rule that if we accept Jesus we are spared from his punishment, but he made us to sin, and he made us to be punished. He could save all of us if He wanted to, but He will only save those that bow to Him.

The way you present God makes him sound like a sadistic asshole to anyone who spends any time thinking about the story as a whole, rather than individual components of it in a vacuum.

I am a Christian, but I don't believe hardly any of the nonsense that you are asserting. I don't believe that God possesses omni-properties for one thing, which gets around a lot of these problems, but I also do not believe in a literal interpretation of Genesis, because it is a children's story. Christians that take these things literally embarrass the rest of us and make our beliefs seem ridiculous.

1356790334.0,48,self.DebateAnAtheist,15mhob,UPDATE: Debate challenge postmortem.,SeaBrass,64,16,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/15mhob/update_debate_challenge_postmortem/,"This thread is a follow-up to the original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/134l0y/my_super_religious_father_believes_he_knows_more/) in which a young atheist asked for volunteers to debate his overbearing Christian father.  I agreed to do so, and we made the arrangements to debate via messages.  

As often happens in these situations I never received a reply from the father to my introductory remarks.  A few weeks later, I got another message from the OP explaining that my introduction had stumped his father, and that he refused to continue the debate.

Here are my introductory remarks:

------------------------------------

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. While I am an atheist I do believe that the question of the existence of god is one of the most important questions that we can ask, and that it is worthy of our best efforts to find the truth. If there is some kind of god who exists and who cares how I live my life enough to punish or reward me, then I want to know about it.

One of the biggest problems in religious debates is the tendency for each side to tell the other what they believe. I will make every effort not to do this. For example, I will not assume that you believe that the Bible is inerrant, that Jesus is god and rose bodily from the grave, or that evolution is false. In return I ask for the same courtesy. Do not assume that being an atheist means that I have no morals, that I believe in nothing, or that I worship Satan. None of these statements accurately describes my beliefs.

I was a Christian for fourteen years before becoming an atheist (not counting the years when I was a child and the years before I made a conscious decision to become a Christian). I had a “born again” experience and spoke in tongues. I preached the gospel to friends, family, and strangers, including on overseas missions trips. I faithfully attended church and was deeply involved in church leadership including teaching Sunday School and leading Bible studies. I fully understood the distinction between having a relationship with Jesus and following rules legalistically. I studied apologetics intensively and debated with non-Christians on a regular basis. And it is because I value truth that when I could no longer accept that Christianity was true I left the faith.

I consider myself to be a gnostic atheist. That is, I both believe that no gods exist, and that I have sufficient evidence to say that I know that no personal gods (of which the Christian god is only one) exist. I reject every god hypothesis that I have studied thus far, including the god of the Bible and the Christian god more generally. It is incorrect to assert that I must know with certainty that no gods exist in order to say that no gods exist. If absolute certainty and knowing all facts in the universe is the standard of proof then we are all agnostics.

I believe that claims should be subject to the outsider test. This test provides objective criteria to determine which, religion, if any, is true. Without a standard for determining which religion is true we cannot know if any of them are true. The outsider test is based on a few principles. First, we tend to believe what we wish to be true. Second, we are subject to confirmation bias, which causes us both to seek out evidence which confirms our prior beliefs while ignoring counter evidence and also causes us to look upon evidence that we accept more favorably while being more skeptical of opposing views. Third, neurological studies have shown that how certain we feel about a belief is unrelated to whether or not that belief is true. And fourth, the most accurate predictors of a person’s religious beliefs have consistently been shown to be their place of birth and what religion their parents practice. Religions tend to be clustered around certain parts of the world, which is a strange thing if one is clearly better than the others. Due to these influences, the outsider test requires that we should treat our own beliefs with the same level of skepticism that we apply to the beliefs of others. For example, if you have certain reasons for rejecting Islam or Mormonism, you should test Christianity by the same standards. If Christianity fails this test, then we do not have good reasons to believe that Christianity is true. And I do believe that Christianity fails when it is not given preferential treatment to shield it from criticism.

What the Christian needs to show, then, is that the preponderance of the evidence indicates that their version of Christianity is true. It is not enough to prove that Christian belief is merely possible, as arguments like the Cosmological Argument seek to do. The Christian must show that Christianity passes the outsider test. If Christianity fails when met with the same objections that you use to reject other faiths, then it is irrational to accept Christianity as true. The Christian must also use religiously salient arguments that lead to the conclusion that their specific god exists, and not just that an impersonal first cause, a most perfect being, or some kind of “higher power” might exist.

To conclude my introductory remarks I want to say a few words about speaking with your son. It is not possible to force someone to believe something. If you are overbearing and arrogant in preaching your beliefs, then the best that you can hope to achieve is to have your son pay lip service to Christianity as long as he lives under your roof, and then turn his back on you completely at the first opportunity. If you care at all about having a relationship with your son, then you need to tolerate the fact that he may not believe the same way as you do. Maybe you are concerned about doing your duty in trying to lead your son to Christ because you feel that it would reflect badly on you or cause you to receive a lesser reward in heaven if you do not try to convert your son, based on passages like Ezekiel 33. If this is the case, then I think that you can rest easy in knowing that your job is done. You gave it your best effort, and now you can wash your hands of the matter. But I hope that you are not so callous and self-serving as to think that way. I am sure that you are an honest man who prays for his son to be saved, therefore, if the Christian god exists and Christianity is true then you do not need to fear the consequences if your son examines the facts for himself. If the evidence leads any reasonable person to believe that Christianity is true then the facts should bear this out.

Thank you again for your time. I look forward to speaking with you further.

For instance:

1) Occam's Razor. There are an infinite number of theories that are consistent with any finite set of data. Why should I believe the simplest? Despite scouring academic writings on the subject, I have yet to see any convincing mathematical justification of the belief that simpler theories have a higher probability of being true. The supposed justifications that do exist are either quite literally faith-based (just give simple theories higher prior probabilities and don't question it) or frame the problem inaccurately.

2) The classic problem of induction. Why is it simply assumed that our future observations will stay the same as our past observations? It is not necessarily true, nor is it a necessary assumption to hold in order to obtain true knowledge (like the assumption that at least some of your perceptions are accurate). Why is it not acceptable to believe some proposition like ""the laws of physics will remain stable up until the year 2100"" when the proposition that ""the laws of physics will remain stable up until forever"" seems equally unfounded? One could use occams razor to wave this problem away, but then you would be left with the problem of justifying that.

Of course, everyone intuitively believes that simpler theories are usually correct and the future will usually resemble the past. But if you justify these beliefs by appealing to intuition, then why can't the belief in religion be justified in the same way?

Come at me.,RockLobster89,71,24,193,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/nb6gz/im_a_new_age_spiritual_hippie_come_at_me/,"Okay. Just found this subreddit, so I'm not quite sure what to expect, except lots of downvotes. From what I've read, it seems like people like to downvote the OP whenever they make a retort in the favor of religion/faith/god, etc.  Don't get me wrong, some of these downvotes are %110 warranted - people need to learn how basic logic works.

All that said, I'd like to have a gentlemanly conversation with you about my beliefs.  I am not religious in any way - I believe that believing in a religion, going to church and all that works for many individuals to help them cope with what they cannot understand, as well as give solace in times of heartache.  That said, I believe the structure of most organized religions indoctrinate fear, subserviance, and ignorance on a mass scale. In some respect, I think of religion like a pure form of any political system - In small groups, they tend to work perfectly. On a massive scale, they tend to crumble.

Personally, I'm what most would call ""New Age,"" which admittedly casts a wide net.  The thing that sucks about defining ""new age"" is that it covers everything from people who meditate for five minutes a day to people messing with crystals to people who channel multi-dimensional cat people - So I'm just going to throw my personal take on it all, then have the hivemind dissect my worldview piece by piece.

Most of my beliefs come from the writings of Neale Donald Walsch, author of ""Conversations with God: An Uncommon Dialogue,"" as well as the meditations of Alan Watts, along with my own personal little take on them.

Some basic tenents of my beliefs - ""God"" is synonymous with Love, Freedom, Limitlessness, and Consciousness. I believe there are levels of consciousness, therefore, levels of ""godhood."" Absolute Consciousness (what we are before birth and after death) really doesn't ""exist"" in the universe - it IS the universe, completely conscious of itself, being everything, yet ""doing"" nothing.

Ergo, I believe everything stems from, and ultimately returns to consciousness.  If you're trying to buy a car, the more conscious you are of what that entails, the more likely you are to get it with ease.

From a philosophical standpoint, I'd call myself an idealist. Meaning, while most hard-nosed scientists will say that consciousness is simply some weird epiphenomenon that arises out of neural firings, and that the material world is all that REALLY exists, I (along with others) choose to explore the opposite possibility - that everything we've ever known, or ever will know, about this universe is nothing but Consciousness - as beings grow in consciousness, their ability to manipulate the material world around them increases. 

Finally, the last tenent of my beliefs that I want to talk about here: We are all one. I realize how hippie and douchey that sounds, but the best explanation I can find would probably be [the parable of the egg](http://galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html)

So, come at me with science, reddit. Unlike most believers, I'm completely willing to discard any belief I have if a newer one comes along that makes **more** sense. While materialism, in my mind, makes *just as much* sense, I prefer idealism - it just rings truer to me as far as the nature of consciousness no longer being dismissed as ""iunno it just happens, but it doesn't really exist.""

Ninja edit: **TL:DR** God (read: consciousness) doesn't exist? Fuck that, you don't exist.

Edit 2 - wow, awesome conversation so far - I like the questions, and the comments are what I expected. For the sake of ease, from now on I'm going to refer to ""consciousness"" as ""god."" Please bare in mind this is not the traditional bearded judging sky god that most religions espouse.

Edit 3 - Okay y'all, I'm putting this one to bed.  I thought this would be downvoted to oblivion, apparantly I got to the #1 spot fairly quickly - that said, I don't have the time, focus, or patience to answer all the great questions left. I highly recommend ""Conversations with God"" for those of you still curious about my definitions of God, consciousness, etc.  As someone put, it's a great story, but so is LOTR. So, in some way, I think I'm a theist in the same way as a LARPer thinks he's an elf. I know it's all bullshit in the grand scheme of things, but I'm a good guy, not hurting anybody, and encouraging people to love one another through a ""god"" parable since a lot of people can't understand the concept without it. I'm looking into all the philosophy links posted, and like I said, if I find something that rings truer to me, I'll adopt it without hesitation.

Most people limit themselves to that position because of: ""Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence"".

I don't think this holds true: Absence of evidence is evidence of absence. And once we have collected a huge amount of evidence, we can say: We know of that thing's absence.

Let's take the case of the Dodo. It is not only known to be extinct. It is proverbially extinct: Dead as a Dodo. We know them to be extinct about as certainly as we know anything.

And yet you, my agnostic brethren, would have to argue that we don't know that. That we can't ever say: ""We know Dodos to be extinct"", even after earth has been shattered by an asteroid. After all you don't accept any evidence for nonexistence.

I consider that strange. When I look for something, and I don't find it, I do consider that as one little piece of evidence for its absence. And once I have looked for Dodos hard enough, once my heap of evidence is high enough, I can say: I know they are gone.

There is a huge confirmation bias, I won't deny that, but this vagueness simply encourages me to look deeper and find explanations. There is also a lot lost in translation and reading in the original arabic does make some things which sound ridiculous sound more logical as there are often very subtle or archaic meanings behind the words used. I think the consensus is generally the same so thought a general response here would be good-

1) Obviously Harun Yahya isn't my only source- denying evolution and the holocaust is clearly stupid so I questioned him and looked at many more books and sources. Both sides- I've read stuff like The God Delusion- I wanted to come to an honest decision. My entire journey was just too boring for internet so decided to just go with the first stepping stone.

So-

2) What I've mostly managed to conclude is that these debates never have a winner. There's a reason I haven't become an atheist and my friends haven't become Muslim. We always reach the same impasse where facts and what we think we know can be manipulated to support the conclusions we already have. I know scientific knowledge is never proved, only disproved- as I have yet to be completely certain that God doesn't exist, I believe that He does perhaps because I was brought up by: rational, smart, good parents who taught me what my religion teaches and nothing they've ever taught me seemed bad to me (the cretins who misinterpret and use their religion as an excuse to be a disgusting excuse for a human or who judge others because of religion anger me more than almost anything else) so I accepted it. 

When I questioned it, I didn't find anything that completely disproved the existence of a God- though I fully agree that innocent people don't deserve to suffer and I can't even begin to try and understand why God would let them, but I can try and do what I can to help reduce their suffering as a fellow human being (and I do. I volunteer abroad, I teach children in poverty and raise money for local people in third world countries- I don't think I'd have the right to say anything if I didn't practice what I preached), and (biggesttheistcopoutevercomingup) hope that they'll get justice in an afterlife. 

I don't think religion and science have to be at loggerheads (moronic idiots who use religion as a shield for their stupidity, and science are a completely different kettle of fish however) so I'm going to continue as I am, still questioning and always open but I think it is true that because I want to believe, I'll interpret things differently. 

There is always going to be an element of blind faith to religion and as irrational as it will probably seem, I accept that and still believe in God. I don't expect you to agree with me as I respect that as atheists, from the same information you have drawn very different, but just as unshakeable conclusions- but I hope this goes at least a small way to dealing with this sort of war atheists and theists have going and that some time, everyone will just gtf over it and just accept that some people believe and some people don't and it really doesn't matter as long as they don't use either as an excuse to be a twat. 

But I love the deep and indepth comments and discussions you see when you start talking about religion so I'm going to go ahead and leave this open. I just don't really think it's something you can debate successfully over the internet.


ORIGINAL POST----

I've grown up in a pretty scientific family- standard Asian with everybody being either a Doctor, Lawyer or an Engineer- and I was raised in a country in Europe where being atheist is far more common than not. Most of my closest friends are atheist (I find I get on far better with scientists who, as a general rule, tend to be pretty sceptical about God). My point is-

I would never believe in the existence of God just because somebody told me it was so. When I was about 14, after a pretty heated debate with one of my best friends about religion where we managed to conclude that the ""WELL WHO CREATED THE PARTICLE WE ALL EVOLVED FROM?!"" argument wasn't valid- I asked my Dad. 

He told me that it was good I was questioning things because our religion wants us to think and come to our own conclusion that we believe it. Despite what the majority of the world seems to think, nobody's supposed to be able to FORCE you to be a Muslim. 

So basically, he gave me some of the books by this guy: http://www.harunyahya.com/ which were all about just how much science is crammed into the Qur'an: Stuff like embryology and the science behind third-degree burns that it just wasn't possible for humans at the time the Qur'an dates back to to have known. 

I know that to atheists this may sound stupid, but after many months and much reading and research, I decided the Qur'an was the proof I needed. There was science in it that humans simply couldn't have put in there, and so I was willing to accept it came from someone with knowledge beyond ours. Hilariously, a friend of mine suggested aliens (if you don't believe aliens exist, you're a moron)... But for now, I'm going to go with God. 

I guess I should just get to the question now- if there was what appears to be scientific proof supporting the existence of a God, would you still disbelieve on the basis of your current reasons for not believing?

i am not trying to have a response written for me. i'd like to see what other like minded people would say if sent something of similar intellectual caliber. i am not going to sum this up with a tl;dr... if you want to take the time to read it, it is up to you. i apologize in advance if this is not something i should be posting here, but other than my own reading and very few atheist friends, i have no where else to turn to get insight.

this first letter is a my response to a few initial emails, and lacking the real foundation of our previous discussion, i am willing to provide any clarification that may be needed.







&gt; you should know, i'm still learning how to disagree with people

&gt; i would also like to point out that, while i certainly haven't studied the bible to the extent that you have, i do know quite a bit about it, and i have a decent understanding of ""christian thinking"". i have not always been atheist. i believed in god for most of my life, or at least thought i did. i often feel that i always questioned it, but there were times that i knew, without a doubt, that god existed and cared for me

&gt;i don't often say a whole lot to you about how i feel on the subject. for the most part, i think you've only heard a fraction of that which i hold in reserve... waiting for serious discussion. you have, on a few occasions that i recall, sent me lengthy messages that are... weighty... with your highly intelligent and well thought out words. i haven't, for the most part, really tried to discuss them with you. at least i don't feel that i have

&gt; if you want to discuss the idea of god, or christianity, we must first throw aside the assumption that it is true- i could be wrong, but i think that you might use the bible as proof of that. i do not know that god does not exist, but i also do not know that he DOES exist. i will not discuss it under the assumption that either is true. but which is more likely? i think that for a god to create something as complex as the universe, he would have to be complex enough himself to question where he came from. so who created the creator? which is more likely... humans evolved from the machinery of the universe, or humans were designed by a god that knows what will happen? and if a god knows what will happen, what is the point of sending them to live a life that he knows they will live, only to punish them for rejecting him? 

&gt; these are not questions that i need answered. they are questions that i only ask in question of the ridiculous ideas themselves. these questions only exist because humans have invented the ideas of gods. i feel that there is a perfectly acceptable replacement: life itself. i exist as a product of 13.7 billion years of evolution. whether that is from a complex creator, or by sheer chance, i do not know. but i strongly suspect that we mere humans are important enough in the grand scope of the universe, to be the sole purpose of such a creator. i find that idea to be arrogant and a direct insult to rational thought

&gt; what i want is to talk about these kinds of things in person. i feel that we can have good, in depth discussion and debate

&gt; while i feel that my intellectual capacity is less than that of yours, i do not believe that mental faculties alone are solely responsible for religious belief or the lack of it

&gt; logic built from the ground up seems to be a dangerous thing to me. it tells me that evidence means next to nil if it presented. that your ideas, if put under scrutiny, or even disproved, will hold in the face of said investigation. that if 2+2=5 was proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, to actually be false, that your logic would tell you to ignore the evidence and maintain that 5 is sound

&gt; i am glad we are friends. but these are some of the reasons i have a difficult time discussing religion or god or christianity with anyone that believes

&gt; and so i end up sharing demeaning links in a facebook status, and alienating myself from those that disagree. wrong? absolutely. that is why you won't see those kinds of posts from me any more-

&gt; but this is the extent that i am willing to discuss it online. we need to see one another, have a few microbrews, and talk long into the night. i think that would lead to a much better conversation

&gt; with or without the beers. guess it doesn't matter 

&gt; i hope that i haven't said anything offensive. i have no intentions of insulting your intelligence. i hold you in very high regard, michael

&gt; i'll be in salt lake this saturday. i doubt i will have time for any serious discussion, but nonetheless, it would be fantastic to see you

&gt; -david




this is his reply:




&gt; David,

&gt; Thank you so much for your fascinating letter.  I've been thinking a lot about it.  We didn't get to hang out on this visit, but I thought I would give you a response and some things to think about before we talk face to face.  This sort of dialogue is invaluable for me to understand how you are thinking, and I'm sure the same holds true for you.  We'll meet soon, and will be able to go into great length about the topic du jour-- religion and spirituality-- but I want to bring up some preliminaries which are absolutely essential to a clear discussion.  

&gt; One thing I like about these talks is that they invariably involve the fields of science, reason, math, logic, argumentation, and philosophy-- fields I'm sure we both hold very dear.  

&gt; Knowledge 
When you speak to me, there is no need to self-deprecate regarding your intelligence.  You are a smart person!  While I believe my knowledge of math, science, and reason is indeed more sophisticated than yours, it is only because I have spent the time studying these disciplines in a rigorous academic environment.  This hasn't come easily, but has been the result of work.  

&gt; I am currently in a fascinating physics class-- a class that has challenged some of the ways I think about science.  I find myself often musing that “David should be here.”  I think you really ought to consider studying the sciences at a university at some point, because you would really enjoy it, and it would benefit you tremendously!

&gt; A couple of your remarks require examination.  Most curious is your remark about logic built from the ground up being a dangerous thing.  I think your idea stems from when I told you Lewis builds his argument from the ground up, after you had said you disagree with his logic.  

&gt; Logic itself is not mine or yours.  I may use the process of logic on a different set of assumptions, leading you to disagree with my conclusions, but unless I make a logical fallacy (a deviation from the known rules of logic), you cannot disagree with the logic: your disagreement stems from the assumptions.

&gt; The remarkable thing is that logic itself is so robust in its ability to show the conditional truth or falsehood of a claim, it defines all of the mathematics.  I find no weight in your example of 2+2=5 being arrived at by logic, since addition is a defined operation whose properties we arrive at by a logically sound proof.  Any idea you find in the mathematics is subjected to what we call a proof.  In writing a proof of a new theorem in mathematics, you start with a concept that is already defined and proven, and you make baby steps toward the theorem in question.  Each step must be logically equivalent to the last.  Propositional logic is, without question, the foundation of mathematics.  If I tried to prove 2+2=5, it is logic that would forbid me.

&gt; You seem concerned that a person clinging to logic would refute empirical evidence.  This is silly, since our method of attaining empirical evidence is called science, and science itself is based in mathematics, which is in turn based in logic.  (I have a number of scientific papers and articles to share with you from my classes.  On this issue, see these two papers by R.W. Hamming, and E. Wigner: http://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/Hamming.unreasonable.html 
http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html “The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences”)

&gt; Previously, I had thought that science gives us proof of something-- a viewpoint I operated under when I responded to Cabe's post on global warming a number of months ago.  Naomi Oreskes has a very well-written paper in the journal “Environmental Science &amp; Policy” discussing this exact issue. http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/ccallender/index_files/Phil%20148/oreskes.proof%20and%20policy.pdf  “Science and Public Policy: What's Proof Got to Do With It?”

&gt; In fact, science does not prove things, and we don't need it to.  I could show you my recent homework in statistical inference (another mathematical discipline built in logic) as a basic example to further illustrate how all this works.  

&gt; We notice something about our world.  We form a null hypothesis-- how we previously thought the world works-- and an alternative hypothesis-- what we now think is going on.  We take data by some experiment, seeking to minimize experimental error.  We examine that data through a statistical test at a certain significance level, meaning we try to minimize both type I and type II error-- type I error being the incorrect rejection of a true null hypothesis, and type II error being the failure to reject a false null hypothesis.  Minimizing type I error usually increases the probability of type II error.  We settle upon an acceptable probability of type I error, say 10% or 5% or 1%, and based on that, we run our statistical test and either reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.

&gt; How Do We Do Science?
We never, in fact, prove the alternate hypothesis!  Rather, we get strong statistical evidence in favor of one interpretation of the data over another.  And that is really all we need in order for science to function as a model of our physical world.  Science is not about proof, and it doesn't have to be in order to be extraordinarily useful.  Don't misunderstand me (and do read Oreskes' paper)!  I am not, for instance, making the common misguided statement about certain scientific disciplines that “Well, it's only a theory.”  I know science a lot better than that.  But neither should you make the statement, “It is fact.”  It is a really awesome model of our physical world with great explanatory and predictive power, and we've been able to arrive at this model through looking at a small piece of reality and making confident inference about the rest through a logical process called mathematics and statistics!  That's amazing!  

&gt; In their landmark paper on Punctuated Equilibrium (http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.pdf)  , prominent evolutionists Niles Eldridge and Stephen J. Gould enter into an important discussion of the epistemological underpinnings that led them to postulate punctuated equilibrium through allopatric speciation as the chief mechanism of evolution.  Pay attention to the heading “The Cloven Hoofprint of Theory.”  This demonstrates how we create the aforementioned alternative hypotheses.  “All observation,” Gould notes, “is colored by theory and expectation.”  He later notes, “Almost all of us adhere, consciously or unconsciously, to the inductivist methodology.  We do not recognize that all our perceptions and descriptions are made in light of theory.”  They go on, and develop their ideas, which you as an evolutionist should read if you haven't already.  Their remarks echo some of the ideas of the philosopher Thomas Kuhn and his concepts of “paradigm shifts.”

&gt; Dark Matter
One important question I have for you is this: Are you only willing to accept as true that which you can measure through subjection to observation and statistical inference?  If so, your epistemology is stuck at a level that will not admit true, but unobservable pheonomena.  For instance, Zach was telling me about how scientists have recently discovered dark matter as a web that holds everything in the universe together.  He claimed that they had measured it.  I had to stop him there.

&gt; As you may know, dark matter is so called because we cannot see, observe, measure, or otherwise detect it.  So what is it?  It is a mathematical construct that accounts for the way the universe behaves, under the assumption that gravity is exactly what we think it is.  It is an object that makes the math work out right.  Something with mathematical properties similar to what we call “dark matter” could exist, explaining what we see, or gravity could be fundamentally different than Einstein believed it to be.  

&gt; Zach replied that since he had seen a graphical representation of dark matter on Discovery channel, a trustworthy source, he knew dark matter exists.  I replied that dark matter does exist-- as a mathematical construct which may or may not correspond to the way things actually work, but right now holds more or less great explanatory power.

&gt; I encourage you to think about how you know the things you know.  Because mathematics and physics are such intellectually inaccessible subjects, it is very difficult for the popular press to communicate these ideas to the layperson in a way that is true to the subtle, important nuances of the fields.

&gt; Your Assumptions and Mine
If we are to discuss God, for reasons I mentioned above, the restriction of our knowledge to observable facts is untenable.  I present one more reason here.  (We first have to straighten out what we mean by “God” when we are discussing him, but assume I mean the Christian definition of God-- I'm not interested in proving the existence of the Hindu pantheon or the distant, unrelational god Allah.)  If God is by Christian definition a being uncontained by the universe-- if the universe is his idea, then a system (science) that observes the physical universe and infers things about it simply does not have the necessary machinery to say anything about this God, positive or negative.  It is impossible, because of what science is!  

&gt; This is why I am so adamant that you learn better what science is!  I think you'll acquiesce-- you “fucking love science!”  

&gt; Rather, in our upcoming discussions, I propose that we take the following approach: you assume your system of thought and its resulting worldview is true, and I will do the same with mine.  You ask me one question, and I will ask you one question, back and forth.  If your system of thought or mine contradicts or fails to explain some aspect of the world in which we live, it will be duly noted.

&gt; A Remark about Christianity
Before we meet, we must give a treatment of the nature of Christianity itself.  Again, I believe not simply in the existence of a god, but the existence of a particular being with certain features.  We have to be talking about the same thing if our discussion is to have any significance.  There are many faiths professing to be “Christian” by virtue of their holding certain beliefs about the person Jesus Christ.  Christianity is well-defined on its own, through the Bible alone.  

&gt; My father, up until he found Christ while I was a toddler, belonged to the Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as the Christian Science Church.  I don't know if you are familiar with their religion, but it is based partly on the Bible, and heavily on Mary Baker Edy's “Science and Health with a Key To the Scriptures.”  My grandmother remains a member of this church: a church with such outrageous ideas it deserves neither the title Christian nor Science.  Do we call them Christians because it is in their name, or because they believe Christ existed?  Do we call them scientists?  

&gt; My uncle, until very recently, belonged to the Jehovah's Witness church.  They too use (an unscholarly-translated version of) the Bible, and they too have extra-Biblical documents which they count as scripture, and which truly define their religion.  Was my uncle a Christian?  As he has now come to know the truth of the gospel, he would tell you no, he was not.  

&gt; My grandfather was a Mormon.  As you are a former Mormon, you no doubt know that the Bible is not the only, or even the primary book that the Mormons count as scripture.  They believe in the Bible “as far as it has been translated correctly,” which actually means “as far as it agrees with current LDS doctrine.”  Forget for a moment that the Bible is a spiritual treatise-- as far as humanity's study of ancient documents goes, the examination of the original Hebrew and Greek (and a little Aramaic) in which the Bible was written, as well as a textual and historical criticism will show that the ancient writers of the Bible do not say the things these three faiths claim that the Bible says.

&gt; I do not doubt you had sincere faith in the LDS worldview as a child.  Now that you have left that church, I know we are in agreement about the absurdity of many of the claims that LDS makes.  I want to stress to you that LDS and Christianity are, at the very best, only superficially the same, while fundamentally different.  I can go into this more, but rather than make this letter too long (which it looks like it will be), I'll refer you to a very good exposition of the subject by Pastor Mark Driscoll: 
http://pastormark.tv/2011/10/18/is-mormonism-a-cult 
He does a fantastic job of explaining this issue.

&gt; My point is that your foundations in the LDS church do not give you an accurate view of what the Bible says, for under that system, its meaning is obscured and the Mormon is led into a system that is not Biblical at all.  Neither are you aware of many aspects of the worldview we call Christian thought.  I mention this largely because it was evident in your letter that the hypothetical god you mention in your letter does not have the properties of the God of the Bible.

&gt; If you hear only one thing, hear this: Christianity is not a religion in the way LDS, JW, or Christian Science are religions.  These groups require membership in an organization, and adherence to certain rules to be a “good Mormon” for instance.  Christianity is not about being a “good Christian”.  It is not a man-made religion operating under a mere man's authority; it is a system of belief where the believer affirms the Bible, and all it says, and is part of the Church that operates under Christ's authority alone.  The Christian Church is not an organization like the LDS Church: rather, it is the group of people who have surrendered  their lives to Christ because apart from him we can do nothing.  We no longer need a fallen human intermediary between us and God, for our intermediary is Christ!  We need no additional scriptures or doctrines.  It is all contained in the Bible, a document entirely consistent with itself (a claim I am prepared to demonstrate, given any challenge).  

&gt; Final Words
I look forward to meeting with you.  We have a lot to discuss.  Hopefully this letter  makes you think.  I did not go into Christian arguments, but provided you the background we will need to have a rational discussion of these issues.  I apologize if it contains grammatical mistakes or is disjoint in its organization, but I don't have time to really proofread it.  

&gt; I look forward to a conversation with you at a higher standard of thought and rationality-- I expect nothing less from you.  

&gt; Yours Truly, 

&gt; Michael

Why are your standards better than mine?  I can prove the existence of the Flying Spaghetti monster based on the logical argument of objective tastiness.  If he didn't exist, who gives you the authority to judge?

EDIT1: So far, no one has been able to answer the question. I am not interested in knowing that you don't believe in objective tastiness, or that your tastiness is subjective. I already know it. I am also not asking about your opinion of tastiness. I am asking you about your authority to judge other people's food on tastiness and where does it come from. So far, as per 6:13 PM GMT-3 Time, no one touched the topic of authority, and merely gave non-answers around the topic. 

2) Why do you believe that pirates can fly, when there is no evidence for it?

EDIT1: So far, no one that believes that pirates can fly have come forward. While I am sure that those exist, they seem shy from providing an answer. I have little interest on the excuses of those that claim to not to believe it, but find it more likely than cats that can fly for any reason whatsoever. The point here is evidence, and lack of it, not your opinion of the subject. Since no one that believes the theory has appeared so far, as per 6:16 PM GMT-3, no answers to the question have been provided.

EDIT1: While I am glad that many people decided to engage in the discussion, it would be far more productive if people actually answered the questions instead of circling around them.

I went through this whole religious and political deconversion last year and adopted free-thought and liberalism at roughly the same time. I was adamantly pro-choice until a few months ago when I was forced to write an argumentation paper for the pro-life cause. It really changed my perspective.

Abortion is wrong because it destroys life; you say you're pro-choice yet where is the child's choice?

**Edit/Update:** Hello! I'm afraid nobody has so far provided any evidence to support the Jesus myth idea. Some have referenced some new theories - in particular that Jesus was a creation of the Essenes, and grew from their expectation of a Messiah. 

Unfortunately this does little to explain the references to Jesus by Paul, and all the other NT writers, who weren't Essenes. Also no-one has provided evidence of Jesus in Essenian literature.

Let me start by saying that this is probably a bit of a read, and that I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read through it and provide any of the answers i'm looking for.


For context, i've been in a discussion with my older brother about science and religion. I respect him as an intelligent person, and he is in fact studying at university to be a professor, i dont know exactly what the subject is called, but i know he teaches greek, and specializes in the bible. He has been in school for quite a few years now.


He beleives in an old earth, and evolution and all that fun stuff, and beleives that the genesis story is just a myth or metaphor and not a literal representation of how the earth was created.


Anyways, in the course of our discussion I posed several questions to him, and his answer is what I need help with. I know in my head that many of the things he says are just wrong, or not being applied properly, however, by myself I am not informed enough on the subjects to articulate the exact reasons or correct him without doing a whole lot of extra reading.


I'm hoping that you fine folks who might have a better knowledge and more readily available references might be able to help me address his main points.


I'm going to put down the question I asked him (or sum it up anyways) and then his answers, copied and pasted (with his permission).


**My question:**


*Who decides which parts of the bible are taken literally and which parts are no longer relevant? Who decides that one book is just a myth or metaphor while others are accurate historical recordings? Why do we not still follow the rules books that were clearly meant to be laws (like leviticus and deuteronomy) but other things still relevant, who got to make that choice?*


**his reply**


 *This is a good question about who decides how to read literature in what way. The bible is a library, not a single book. 66 books, many authors (lots who are anonymous) with many genre's represented. Knowing which parts are ancient history, which parts are not, etc. and how to thus read them is based on both internal and external evidence - which is true of any literature. It would be altogether surprising if that many authors writing that much all wrote the same types of works all meant to be read the same way.
As far as internal evidence, we have simple things like rhyming that clue us in to poem's or poetry. Headlines before a paragraph clue us in that we're reading the news, etc. The external evidence is the more important though. You and I know intrinsically to read a history textbook different than a comic strip because of the medium. We would also potentially spot something like alliteration or metaphor's and similes because we've been taught. For a simple biblical example - the book of proverbs are short pithy sayings of proverbial wisdom. They aren't meant to be taken as ""true for all eternity.""*


*For the more ""controversial"" portions, we learn how to read and understand them by also comparing with similar types of literature from that period. By comparing back and forth we come to understand their characteristics. So for example, the Gospels are similar to greco-roman biographies. They exhibit the traits of these and were researched and written by similar standards. Jesus taught in parables - stories made up on the spot to make a point (or several points). Parables were used by lots of ancient writers and teachers. We shouldn't read them as literally true stories.*


*As far as Genesis goes - it is labeled as primeval or primordial history/saga/myth. There are other creation epics like this in ancient literature. These creation stories explained the origins of the universe for the people who read it. There is little doubt that those who read it believed that is how it happened - they had no reason not to think so. And they were also aware that other cultures around them had different creation stories, which informed their worldview. The Genesis creation story is not the earliest either - it likely was written as a correction to other dominant creation myths, which were usually based on polytheism and gods fighting one another, etc.*


*As far as Leviticus and Deuteronomy - this is a slightly different question, but a good one because non-Christians so frequently don't understand this. In this case, the belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus are central. The New Testament teaches that Christ is the end of the law. That his sacrifice on the cross was the last sacrifice that needed to be made. This means that much of the Old Testament laws in those law books no longer apply. That doesn't mean ALL are thrown out - much of the moral law still stands because they are upheld in the New Testament.*


**my question**


*since you acknowledge science and the facts of evolution and an old earth, how do you tie that in with your beleif that we live in a fallen world full of sin? Who made the first sin? was it the original single cell organism, was it the first creature to walk on 2 legs, was it the first homo sapien? Humans didnt just pop up overnight, so when was sin introduced?*


*Or was the story just meant to illustrate the first 2 humans that sinned? in that case, again, which humans and at what stage of the evolutionary chain? We as animals have been killing and having sex and all kinds of sinful things for hundreds of thousands of years, did god just pick a spot along the line and declare that we are now all sinners?*


**his answer**


*As to the Adam and Eve story — I'm undecided on this one in some senses. First, I do find it interesting that as far as genetics goes, they have identified mitochondrial eve - the woman who existed 200,000 years ago whom we are all related to. Last I read, geneticists seem also to agree that modern humans all came from the area of the Mediterranean. So, scientifically speaking there is an Eve at least - and although we don't have the proof, someone had to have impregnated her :-)*


*I think, more than that though, is that the story of creation and the fall are not to be read as scientific documentation. It represents the reality that as human beings with free will we are inclined to choices that drive us away from our creator. It is an archetype-type story. Even if you don't believe in God, you can't deny that we as human beings often make choices that are detrimental to us - it is human nature. Once you have your own child, you'll see that you don't need to teach them how to do bad things and disobey - they just do them, often to be outright defiant :-). *


**my question**


*talking about how I dont understand how someone can claim to have a strong interest in science and at the same time beleive in a divine creator who controls everything*


**his reply**


* From my journeys through this whole science and God discussion I have run across very few scientists who say they are incompatible - that type of rhetoric is primarily confined to the new atheism (i.e. dawkins, hitchins, dennett, and all their disciples).*


*I must say, I am equally as baffled that anyone could hold to the atheistic faith. How is it the everything came from nothing? Cosmologists tell us the universe began to exist 13 billion years ago. The logic is this: 1) Everything that begins to exist has a cause. 2) The universe began to exist, therefore 3) the universe has a cause. Furthermore, science has revealed, amazingly, how delicate this whole universe is and how it just so happens to have all the exactly correct properties so that it could not only expand but support carbon-based life forms. This is called the ""fine tuning"" argument (of which the anthropic principle is a part), and it is what caused Antony Flew (THE atheist of our grandparents generation) to become a theist later in life.*


*Finally, it is a pretty basic premise that life cannot come from non-life. Science has attempted to explain this and fine-tuning, by pushing the past back as far as they can. In other words, given enough time the impossible (life and the universe springing into being randomly) can become possible. But we can't push back any further than the big bang. So now the faith of the atheist sits upon the multiverse theory (i.e. there are an infinite number of other universes) to give us even more chance for the impossible to be possible. But even if the multiverse is true, they still argue it began at the big bang. And it still doesn't solve the issue of how something (this time millions and millions of somethings) came from nothing. So frankly, I'm just as mystified at an atheistic worldview !*


*I thought you might find this interesting - I met a trained biologist (who is a Christian) who only holds loosely to evolution. He isn't that impressed with the number of transitional forms in the fossil record. He said speciation and adaptation are very well attested, but transitional forms not nearly as much as he'd like to see before firmly holding to a theory.*


That last reply of his is the one I would most like help tackling.

Specifically, is it really accurate to say that most scientists dont think that religion and science are incompatible? He also tends to make comments like that quite often, claiming things like ""most scholars agree"" or ""the consensus is"" when talking about the accuracy of the bible for example.


I honestly dont mind people having religious beleifs, and I only get into discussions like this with him when I see him making claims that try and tie his beleifs in with science, and then I have to speak up.


I'm interested in any comments anyone can make on his points, in particular that last one, in order to help me formulate a response to all of this.

However, this seems to miss what's happened in epistemology in recent years with respect to fallibilism.  In epistemology, fallibilism is the thesis that we don't need to absolutely certain of something in order for it to count as knowledge, and the position is largely accepted among epistemologists.  In almost any particular case there is *some* possibility that we could be mistaken, yet we still have quite a bit of knowledge, so it must be the case that we can know things while reserving the (unlikely) possibility that we are mistaken.

On this proposal, I *know* the Lochness Monster doesn't exist, even though it's a *remote possibility* that I could be wrong.  If I'm wrong, I'm wrong about two things: the Lochness Monster existing, and the fact that I knew it.  Presumably, however, I'm right, and, given that I think this, I can say that I *know* the Lochness Monster doesn't exist.  

I think it's probably more likely that the Lochness Monster exists than God (Since, as I see it, the Lochness Monster is at least *physically possible*), and so I would say that I also know God does not exist, and I would say this *with an even greater degree of confidence.* 

This is a much stronger claim than agnostic atheism, but, given that I think it's defensible, I think it's the path an atheist should take.

-------------------------------

Edit 1:  Of course, one needs to be clear on what is *meant* by ""God"" before they claim to know that it doesn't exist.  If someone says that God is ""mystical unity"" or ""transcendental love"" or something like that, we shouldn't say that we know these things don't exist, but rather question why it is appropriate to call these things ""God.""

Edit 2:  In a conversational setting, it might lend itself to more confusion and less productive conversation if one walks around saying ""I'm a gnostic atheist, I *know* there is no God!"" .  It might likely be more productive to simply identify as an atheist from the outset and clarify the position when needed.  The point here is that explicitly identifying as a gnostic atheist could be a move that one could employ in certain circumstances.  Perhaps if someone says ""But you don't *know* there is no God,"" you can claim, ""No, I do know, and you're being unclear/inconsistent about your usage of what it means to know something."" This won't be the most useful move in *all* arguments, but if you identify as a gnostic atheist (and I think it might be right to do so), the move is an honest one that is available to you and might well be useful.

-Science is unable to prove anything. All it's for is disproving. However, since it's unable to disprove the existence of a god, a god must exist.

-The universe is constantly expanding. However, what exactly is it expanding into? There must be something beyond our physical realm that the universe is expanding into, thus a god can and likely does exist outside.

-Everything has a creator from the universe to the earth. Therefore, the universe was created by a god.

-Christians have no burden of proof due to faith. They don't have to prove that God exists; atheists have to prove that God doesn't exist.

-Science can only explain so much, thus there is room for a god. Therefore, a god exists.

by TIMOTHY KELLER

[Introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xn11k/would_rdebateanatheist_be_up_for_a_book_review/)

[Chapter 1: *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xsm46/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

[Chapter 2: *How Could a Good God Allow Suffering?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/zizxu/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

**Chapter 3 - Christianity is a Straitjacket**

&gt;The Christians I know don't seem to have the freedom to think for themselves. I believe each individual must determine truth for him- or herself.

Like chapters before this one I started out hopeful.  I thought this chapter might resonate with me, or at least address me and my worldview.  It became quickly apparent Keller was going to take this a different direction.  

Rather than truth being something we need to investigate on our own and not take on authority, Keller attacks a strawman.   He always misses the mark when he tries to represent the atheist position

&gt;In this view, ""freedom' means that there is no overarching purpose for which we were created.  If there were, we would be obligated to conform to it and to fulfill it, and that is limiting.  

His representations of atheism remind of the serpent in genesis.  He mixes truth and lies, he is deceptive.  He uses most of the words I would use but he twists them to mean something entirely different then what my actual position is.   He continues the strawmans for several pages.

&gt;If you say all truth-claims are power plays...

I don't.  If you want to read his rebuttals to the strawman (which I didn't even find that impressive) feel free but the first half of this chapter was not written to me or any skeptic I know.  

He shifts gears and starts playing his favorite card.  'I know you are but what am I'.  Basically the wrong he has been accused of he claims is done by everyone.  *Community Can't Be Completely Inclusive* is the heading for the next section and his example is priceless.  

He compares an anti-gay organization to a pro-gay organization.  

&gt;Consider an illustration.  Imagine that one of the board members of the local Gay, Lesbian, and Transgender Community Center announces, ""I've had a religious experience and now believe homosexuality is a sin.""

Eventually this board member is kicked out of the club.  He then tries to argue that this exclusion is the same as the anti-gay club kicking out the pro-gay board member.    Intollerance towards intollerance =/= intollerance.  I am so frustrated with this rhetoric and it blows my mind that Keller used this line of reasoning.  It isn't the first time I have heard it, but those that do use it I view as the lowest common denominator within Christianity.  A good example is when Mormons cried persecution because of the backlash they recieved for their prop 8 support. Keller disapointed me severly in this chapter and he reached a new low hear.  Its obvious this book is not written to skeptics but rather Christians who already aggree with him.

The chapter finally gets interesting when he starts trying to make his own case.  Not because his arguments are well thought out but because it gave me something to address.

&gt;... confinement and constraint is actually a means to liberation.  If you have musical aptitude, you may give yourself to practice, practice, practice the piano for years.  This is a restriction, a limit on your freedom.

Say what?  Half way through the chapter I was willing to grant Keller that Christianity is not a straitjacket.  Not because he had addressed any arguments I might have on the subject but because I honestly don't find that topic all that compelling.  I am more interested in its truth value.  However once Keller started giving his viewpoint and stopped attacking a strawman I started to agree that Christianity is a straitjacket.  His defense of the topic was more damming then the strawman's attack on the topic.  He makes the most oximoronic/paradoxical statements (""liberating restrictions"") throughout and then concludes with the worst possible metaphor.

But before we get to the metaphor I loved this strawman he created.

&gt;The popular concept--that we should each determine our own morality--is based on the belief that the spiritual realm is nothing at all like the rest of the world. Does anyone really believe that?

LOL, ya this book is not written to me (or any other skeptic), I honestly don't know who he is talking to.  He continues with a hypothetical interaction between him and a 'skeptic' to prove how easy it was to stump the skeptic.

&gt;One of the most frequent statements I heard was that ""Every person has to define right and wrong for him- or herself.""  I always responded to the speakers by asking, ""Is there anyone in the world right now doing things you believe they should stop doing no matter what they personally believe about the correctness of their behavior?"" They would invariably say, ""Yes, of course.""  Then I would ask, ""Doesn't that mean that you *do* believe there is some kind of moral reality that is 'there' that is not defined by us, that must be abided by regardless of what a person feels or thinkins?""

**NO!!!!!!**  (I screamed at the pages, but of course...)

&gt; Almost always, the response to that question was a silence, either a thoughtful one or a grumpy one.

PWNED!! Keller just pwned the idiot strawman, good job Keller.  I don't know if he is just lieing or if there is a strong selection bias for idiots in Keller's life.  I actually think the latter true, I mean honestly who is walking into churches and debating the priest about subjective morality?  

Anyway lets get onto his awesome metaphor so Keller can help us visualize how free Christianity is.

&gt;One of the principles of love-- either love for a friend or romantic love-- is that you have to lose independence to attain greater intimacy.  

&gt;You cannot enter a deep relationship and still make unilateral decisions or allow your friend or lover no say in hou you live your life.  To experience the joy and freedom of love, you must give up your personal autonomy.

&gt;healthy love realtionships involve a mutual loss of independence

So according to Keller, Christianity is as restrictive as a terrible relationship.  Rather than addressing this I will just let Keller keep digging.

&gt;For a love realationship to be healthy there must be a mutual loss of independence. 

however

&gt;If only one party does all the sacrificing... the relationship will be exploitative and opress[ive]

&gt;At first sight, then, a realtionship with God seems inherently dehumanizing. 

(the first relationship he described was dehumanizing enough, but God relationships take the cake)

&gt;While this may be be true in other religions... it is not true in Christianity.

how so?

&gt;God has said to us,... ""I will change for you.""

And you just opened up a can of worms that you will not address.  Keep digging. 

&gt;St. Paul writes, ""The love of Christ constrains us""

but its not constricting...

Keller makes the best case that 'Christinaity Is a Straitjacket.'  He is obviously writing to Christians however I would find even many Christians disagree with Keller's viewpoints on this topic.  Thats a might deep hole you got there Keller.  So to summarize Christianity *is* a straitjacket or a shitty exploitative realtionship.

My belief is mostly based on the awe the majesty of the universe instills in me, my own personal sense that there is something greater than myself, and most of all a logical deduction that I can't believe in an uncaused cause, that there has to have been something to create all this.  Believe me, coming from my background I understand disbelief in organized religion, but it seems like a lot of what I hear from atheists is an all or nothing proposition.  If you don't believe in Christianity or a similar faith you make the jump all the way to atheism.  I see belief in God boiled down to things like opposition to gay marriage, disbelief in evolution, logical holes in the bible, etc.  To me that doesn't speak at all to the actual existence of God it only speaks to the failings of humans to understand God and the close-mindedness of some theists.  It seems like a strawman to me. 

EDIT: Thanks for the thoughtful responses everyone.  I can't say you've changed my mind on anything but you have helped me understand atheism a lot better.  A lot of you seem to say that if there is no evidence of God that doesn't mean he doesn't exist, but he's not really worth considering.

I have many questions, but my big one is: why question Jesus' historical existence?  

Other questions include: If you don't believe he existed as a human, why not?  Do you believe in other historical figures that cannot be proven by physical evidence?  Do you believe in the existence of the actual humans described in stories of heroes from other legends, including but not limited to Hercules, Beowulf, Socrates, Joan of Arc, Black Hawk, Paul Bunyan, etc?  In all cases, of course I don't believe that the stories told about them are necessarily true, but I believe there's a *possibility* that they're based around a real person that people made up stories about and passed down.  I don't sit around and ask people to prove that any of them existed, and I can't figure out why I would.  Who cares if they actually existed?  It doesn't make any difference to my day if someone believes that Hercules was actually a person at some point.

I'm sorry if my questions come across as argumentative, but I really just am horribly curious.  The whole idea that people question historical figures' existence has completely blown my mind--I feel like I just swallowed the red pill and jumped down the rabbit hole.

Any friendly Atheists care to offer answers to this questioning Christian?

He had some points that I would like to discuss here.
Note: I believe him to be mistaken in his thinking I was aggressive. I did not swear and  merely called him out for preaching.
Anyway, this is what he said:



Despite your puerile and somewhat aggressive messages, I have still decided to reply today, especially as I returned home earlier than expected.

You wanted evidence. I will supply it. And I will expect proper refutation of each and every part of the evidence with counter-evidence that is equally as compelling, or you have failed and I suggest you eat your vile words. it's quite simple.

There are many routes to take, of course, from teleological, cosmological and moral arguments through to the Resurrection, historicity of the scriptural (and non-scriptural) accounts and so on. But it will be enough for this stage to look solely at the teleological argument as a start. But remember, unless you refute this with actual evidence that is equally (if not more so) compelling and counters these arguments totally, you have failed at the first hurdle without even managing to look at the rest of the evidence.

So:

Part 1: Evidence for Design and therefore a designer God.

First, a little about me, and why I have authority with which to speak on the matter (do YOU have any authority to counter it i wonder?). I spent nearly 30 years in science, both in research as well as education, but mostly in teaching at high level - chemistry, astronomy and cosmology. I hold two science degrees. I took early retirement and am now a priest in the Anglican Church having also a diploma in Christian Studies and a degree in theology. So I am not an armchair critic like so many here on Youtube, who, having read a Dan Brown novel or two, feel they are experts on the Christian Church. Nor am I a card-carrying Creationist who, in my opinion, have done more harm to the cause of Christianity than any atheist has ever even attempted to do. I am now a priest with a scientific background as opposed to my previous career as a scientist who was also a Christian.

So, to the question in hand about your need for evidence, I will present it using simple logic and reason, together with evidence from the universe (and hence God's creation) itself. But first a few misconceptions must be ironed out...

1. Science and 'proof' or more correctly, the absence of it

Regarding the validity of God and an assumption that science can 'prove' things, this is wrong. Apart from the discipline of mathematics, and despite what some might claim, science can 'prove' nothing. That is not scientific method. Instead, science makes a hypothesis based on an idea, then obtains evidence to support it (or not), and then makes a conclusion based on that evidence. If the evidence and logical (logical, mind you) corollaries to that evidence are overwhelming then it becomes an accepted scientific 'fact' - until it is refined by something better later. As an example, Newton's laws of motion became known as 'fact' (hence the word 'law' as opposed to 'theory') until refined for high velocities by Einstein centuries later in his Special and General Theories of Relativity. They are still not (and never will be) 'proven' but the evidence strongly, and some would say, irrefutably suggests that both Einstein and Newton explain certain aspects of the universe with integrity and reliability.

So, any scientific approach HAS to be concerned with hard evidence, and, following that, assessing the likelihood (LIKELIHOOD, mind you, not certainty) of something being fact.

2. Arguments that could be tabled

There are a huge number of arguments supporting Christianity, not just historical or social, nor scriptural or anecdotal. as I said above, there are arguments involving morals, teleology, grace, the resurrection and a host of other things. But let's look briefly at the teleological argument as a 'taster'. Establish this FIRST, and if it whet's your appetite, then maybe the other arguments could follow. However, all I ask is that you don't dismiss this in sweeping meaningless puerile statements, just because the argument s compelling and irrefutable, but you don't happen to agree with it because you don't have the guts to meet Christ's challenge.

As I said above, if you don't agree, then I can only accept a rebuttal if you come up with a counter-argument that is equally as persuasive. I think that is fair. Just stating,. with an arrogant ignorance that it's 'rubbish', without giving an equally persuasive argument as to WHY you believe it's rubbish, won't do. Understood?

So, first, evidence for design.


3. Evidence for design

First you must realise that the Big Bang was never the accepted theory for the beginning of the Universe by most scientists (including Sir Fred Hoyle, one of the most lauded cosmologists of the 20th century) for a long time, despite a moment of Creation being an established dogma of the christian church, and, though postulated BY the Church because of its description in scripture, and, indirectly, by people like Einstein in his Special and General Theories of Relativity, it was ridiculed, not only by the likes of Hoyle, but by many even in the Academy of Sciences in the US and the Royal Society in the UK. As a result, Hoyle's 'Steady State' theory was put forward as factual for decades in the early to middle 20th century. The universe had always been here and always will.

It wasn't until Wilson and Penzias (Google them and their horn antenna, pigeon droppings and so on) came along and actually discovered the background radiation from the moment of Creation/Big Bang that the greatest scientific minds had to rethink their beliefs in the light of evidence to the contrary. The Big Bang dictated that not only matter, but space and even time itself had to be created 'ex nihilo' (from nothing). There was NO before the Big Bang as, according to Relativity, even time itself had not been created. ""Science"" sometimes (more often than you think) gets things VERY wrong.

This was shown conclusively by Einstein in his Relativity theories. At the Big Bang not only matter and energy were created but dimensional space and time also. When we see galaxies moving away from each other today, they are not doing so by flying through space that is already there; it is the space ITSELF that is expanding - space that was at one time at the singularity of the Big Bang - taking these galaxies with them. And Creation from a singularity (whatever that really is) 12.5 billion years ago or so, meant that there was no 'before' this - just like there is no temperature colder than absolute zero, nor could, by definition of what temperature is, there ever be a colder temperature.

However, during the first microseconds of the universe's existence ('the Plank Epoch') literally hundreds of the most fundamental constants and parameters were put in place and set in stone. And they are still exactly as they were at the moment of Creation, keeping the universe ticking over like clockwork. I'm not talking here about nice, sentimental thoughts about our planet being ""just the right distance from the sun for life as we know it"", and so on, as there may well be millions of planets out there equally able to support life of one form or another and with the same conditions as here on earth. No. I am talking here of THE most fundamental constants that make the universe tick - the most fundamental constants that, without which, we would HAVE no atoms let alone life made from them. Constants like the Plank Constant, Boltzman Constant, Gravitational Constant, the mass/charge ratio of an electron, and so on are what I am talking about here.. And ALL these are set EXACTLY within MINISCULE tolerances that allow the infinitessimally unlikely event of life being able to evolve. Anywhere. Anywhere in the universe.

This is known as the Anthropic Principle.

Life requires molecules complex enough to allow biochemical reactions to exist within cells. This is the basis of physiology of any living organism, from a simple one-celled bacterium to a whale. Spectroscopy shows that the elements on earth are identical with those spread across the universe; a carbon atom in your brain is identical with one found in the Queen's tiara and is identical with one found, say, in the 'second star on the left' of the Andromeda Galaxy. And all heavier atoms like carbon, oxygen, phosphorus, nitrogen and other elements necessary for life are produced within stars by nuclear fusion before being spewed out into the universe by novas. Your body is made of material once spewed out by a collapsing star. And carbon is the ONLY element in the universe that is able to form complex molecules by virtue of its unique atomic structure, with amazing 'coincidence' caused by many of these fundamental constants put in place at the Big Bang. Silicon, of course, can also form some basic macromolecules, but nowhere near the extent that carbon can - and certainly nowhere near the complexity of protein, enzymes and so on, or, in fact, ANY chemical that can be considered as a possible contributor to the basic requirements (eg excretion, reproduction, growth etc) for something to be called 'alive'.

Therefore ALL life forms across the universe (if there are any others apart from here) MUST be based somehow on carbon. And it's no use saying that maybe if the universe was different life would take on another form. Sadly for atheists this is not possible as the only element in the universe that is CAPABLE of producing the complex molecules for life is carbon, as it is the only element whose atoms have both an outer electron level half full AND where the energies required in its atoms to complete the outermost molecular orbital are perfectly appropriate for producing long chains of carbon atoms and hence complex molecules. You may know Silicon and Germanium can do this to some extent, but, as I said, nowhere near the extent needed to build giant replicating molecules like DNA. Carbon's nature exists, and is able to form such molecules, ONLY in the infinitesimally narrow ranges dictated by the Anthropic Principle.

The parameters between which carbon is able and not able to form complex molecules are remarkable close. The temperature range, for example, in which these compounds can exist and react is very small. Yet the average temperature of the universe is JUST right to allow this to happen. But this is just one simple 'coincidence' to illustrate the rest:

4. Anthropic constants

Back to the constants, OK? I cannot speak to all of them here (although I AM able to having taught cosmology!), because that would take up too much space and time (if you pardon the pun), so let's take just one -- the gravitational constant, G, since you mentioned in in your email.

G has a tiny value (0.0000000000667300 approximately) but the fact remains that it its value was a fraction of one percent higher (actually less than 0.03%), then stars would form more quickly, be hotter, but would burn out long before life in one of their associated solar systems could evolve. Moreover, they would be unlikely to form novas and spew out heavier elements into the cosmos. If the constant was a tiny fraction of one percent of its value SMALLER, all stars would be red giants, and be neither hot enough nor able to go nova again not only being unable to support life but not even to be able to produce the heavier elements in the first place. For this universe, the value of 'G' is absolutely and exactly the value it should be to enable a universe like this to, one day, support life. We can calculate the tolerance as a percentage simply by looking at the values of G at its extremes - between zero (no gravity anywhere in the universe) to the value that would just prevent the big bang. Even if we looked at ten times the indicated tolerance of around +/- 0.3% before life could not exist, this represents statistical and mathematical odds of 3330:1 against it's value being by chance. Not a huge anount, but significant.

But if you do the same with, say, the Planck constant, with the same tolerance percentage, this raises the odds to the product of the two figures (3330 x 3330) : 1, or over 11,000,000 to one against BOTH being just by chance. But there are not just two constants set in stone at the Big Bang. There are over eighty, and ALL with similarly fine tolerances, and all set at EXACTLY the right levels or strengths to enable life to exist. In fact, if only ONE of them were to fall outside this narrow range, life could not evolve anywhere - it's no use saying that the others might 'compensate' in one way or another. And the odds against this happening by chance are astronomically high.

The odds have actually been calculated knowing the number of constants involved and the percentage tolerance within each. The chances of these constants being all 'just right' occurring purely by chance (or the odds against the universal constants being outside these fine tolerances, whichever you prefer) is well over 10 to the power 90 against. Now considering the number of ATOMS in the known universe is 10 to the power 80 or thereabouts, this number is 10,000,000,000 times greater. Therefore the universe being as it is is not just unlikely. It's beyond all doubt (unless you are particularly stubborn) a product of something that is not simply chance. You can be pretty certain that this is no coincidence unless you put aside all common sense and ignore mathematical statistical analysis (although I would not be surprised if you did, believing in little green men as you do). So it seems that the fine tuning is done for a reason - and that reason, of course, is so that life can exist, or why set those tolerances at the particular levels they are? it is almost infinitely more likely - if the universe were left to chance - that life SHOULDN'T be able to exist. So why does it?

The point is that we ARE here. Against ALL odds this universe has enabled us to be here. It is as if the universe, at the Big Bang, KNEW we were coming. The universe has managed - either through an unbelievingly small chance, hit the nail right on the head, or there is an element of design making life possible.

Moreover, these are the odds against life-enhancing conditions being by chance ONLY for the fundamental constants. There are a host of other parameters too, like the unique characteristics of the carbon atom, the rate at which time itself flows, and new developments with the discovery of dark matter that raise the odds against chance higher still. Some say that for dark matter alone it raises the odds against the universe being by chance to 10 to the power 250 against (1 with 250 zero's after it) although as we know little about dark matter the figure may be just a few zeros out!

This so-called Anthropic Principle, as explained above, can be tested and verified by looking at the evidence of the constants and the Planck Epoch (the first few seconds after the Big Bang), and has been time and time again.

5. Multiverses dismissed

There is, of course, the old chestnut that the universe is 'one of many' or 'one of an infinite number' and ours just 'hits the right spot'. However this 'multiverse' theory, is not scientific as it cannot be tested.

Humanity is bound within the spacetime of our own universe and cannot test the theory that there are multiple universes of which we have no part. Therefore, the theory cannot be tested scientifically. If I had lived before the days of spectroscopic analysis, I could have equally said that the stars were made from marshmallow, or the moon from cheese. These theories would be equally valid as they could not be tested then. But nowadays I can easily be proved wrong because the spectroscopic analysis of starlight tells us otherwise, and NASA has been to the moon to prove it isn't made from cheese. The problem with the multiverse theory, however, is that it NEVER CAN be tested fully unless we actually step outside our own universe - which we cannot. There are speculative ideas out there in electron transfer and so on, but none of these will ever be able to be tested. So, as it can never be tested and so it can never be regarded as scientific evidence. It's fanciful speculation, pure and simple. In fact it's speculation to the point of saying that a green-bug-eyed monster made the universe; anything so that an atheist does not have to say the 'G'-word. So please put that out of your mind as 'evidence' of any integrity or reliability. It's interesting also to note that there are as many 'multiverse' and 'string' theories as there are 'multiverse' and 'string' theorists. Not all of them can be correct! And NONE of them CAN be shown, with evidence, to be correct as none of their theories can be tested.

So, it seems, the only conclusion we have to arrive at, by looking at just one piece of evidence (the fundamental constants) from among many I could cite, is that either the Big Bang is a random event that by some crazy way utterly defies unbelievably astronomical odds against forming life, or that there is an element of design within the universe. If you believe the former then you are more gullible than I care to mention. The evidence FIRMLY and IRREFUTABLY points to the latter.


6. Design and nature of designer - 'God of the gaps' dismissed

The problem for atheists who accept the scientific evidence here (and it is absolutely compelling) is that, if there is design, there MUST, ipso facto, BE A DESIGNER. Nor am I talking here of a 'God of the gaps', where, because we do not understand something, we fill the space with 'God'. We DO understand the Big Bang remarkable well. we DO understand the Anthropic Principle. And it irrefutably points to design. The ONLY logical and honest corollary of this must be that if there is 'design' then there MUST be a designer. Period.

So, the universe is either

(a) a random structure, produced by a series of random events:

If this is so, the evidence does not bear this out. The fundamental constants and laws necessary to allow the fine-tuned conditions for life to exist anywhere are obvious for all to see. Even events that appear 'random' are subject to the universe's Laws as described in Chaos theory. You can refute this if you wish, but ONLY if you can come up with a VALID alternative that is equally plausible, based on the evidence we see, and which cannot be refuted. No personal or prejudiced opinions, please.

Or (b). There is evidence of design in the universe. And if there is design, then there MUST, by the very definition of the word, be a designer.

Those are the ONLY two alternatives.

7. Nature of the Designer

As to the nature of that designer, Dawkings, of course, insists that if there is to be a designer then he or she must have existed before the Big Bang and, as Einstein pointed out, as there was no 'before' the Big Bang, he or she could not exist. But of course that argument is heavily flawed as it relies on any 'God' being constrained to time as we know it. The fallacy of a designer having to be more complex than its creation is something continually peddled by people like Richard Dawkings and his disciples (who have little realy knowledge of relativity - just as Dawkings has little knowledge of it). He doesn't believe in the God of his books, but then neither do I. In fact I hardly recognise Him the way Dawkins describes 'it'. Neither Dawkins nor I believe in HIS God. It certainly isn't the God of the Bible nor the Christian but something that Dawkins has made up in his own mind as his own, rather naive and misguided, perception of God. Dawkings may be an excellent biologist - but outside his own field, he's a pretty ignorant (and, some would say, arrogant) individual.

But that's by the way.

Dawkins' claim that any designer must be more complex than his design means that, if true, the designer is the subject of cause and effect the designer designs and therefore has to exist BEFORE the designed universe. This idea is nowhere to be seen in the Christian faith, nor in scripture. Anywhere. And it never HAS been despite what some atheists (who have listened to Dawking's naive views rather than researched it for themselves) believe. Nor is it allowed in Einstein's relativistic view of the Big Bang for that matter.

Christians (and Jews and Muslims) have always accepted an 'eternal' God. Eternality does not mean 'goes on for ever within time' but means 'exists outside of time'.

This is not as far-fetched as it sounds. As an analogy (though not a perfect one, but it will give you some idea), according to Einstein, time slows down more and more the closer one gets to the speed of light. At light speed, time stops. So a light ray can be thought of as having absolutely no concept of time -- it is eternal in the true sense of the word, and therefore not subject to cause and effect in itself. However, it is able to react with things IN time (like our retinas, a leaf to begin photosynthesis, or a photographic film). Moreover, if something exists eternally like this, it cannot have any element of matter or mass, as mass becomes infinite at light speed.

So we are left with the problem of evidence not just pointing to a designer, but a designer of a very specific nature. Any designer MUST have the qualities of an ex-temporal existence as he/she/it could not be in the position of designing BEFORE the Big Bang as there was NO 'before'. Similarly, to exist in an eternal state, the designer could not have mass nor be made of matter. Also, as the rules set at the Big Bang are continuing to maintain the universe, the designer MUST have some way of interacting, whilst outside spacetime him/her/itself, with the universe WITHIN spacetime.

8. Summary

So, to summarise:

1. Evidence points irrefutably to design within the universe. This is shown clearly by the Anthropic phenomena as well as many other areas not yet touched on (but if you wish, we can discuss them)

2. The concession of an atheist in that design is possible must mean that the honest, logical corollary of this is that if there is design, there must, ipso facto, be a designer. Anything else is not being honest and true to the evidence.

3. The nature of the designer must be such that whatever he/she/it IS means that the designer must be outside the normal spacetime; eternal, and yet able to interact with the universe -- including us -- WITHIN spacetime. Thus Dawkins' claim of a designer there 'before' the design is irrelevant as there was NO 'before' the Big Bang, and thus no need of a designer to be there 'before' anything.

4. However, the evidence still bears out the need for a designer in the first place.

So, whatever you call this 'designer' the evidence points firmly to his/her/its existence. Note I have hardly mentioned (except to quote Dawkins) the 'G' word. Evidence for God as the answer to this designer question is also overwhelming, but that is the topic for another discussion, where we would have to consider a number of extra areas listed at the start of this message. These include the ACTUAL nature of God as believed by humans for many thousands of years, as opposed to the Dawkings model of a 'god' that bears no resemblance to actual belief. In addition to the other criteria, we also need to look at the Resurrection, grace, love, historicity of ancient documents, and more, and, yes, scripture, although that is just one small part of the evidence.

But let's leave it there, with the design/designer/nature of designer for the moment. More another time if you wish.

I would welcome your comments. However, please don't stoop to insult, profanity, ridicule or further abuse. That shows a weakness of argument and I will refuse to respond to anything that vaguely smells of this sort of cyber-abuse. If you choose this latter path I will have no hesitation to block you.

I've been a closet atheist around her and her family, with a general ""live and let live"" attitude toward their beliefs.  Well, my wife has been doing the bible study thing and the light bulb went off during one of her study groups.  This began when she questioned why one denomination of faith is more true than others when all lack evidence and must rely on faith.  

She had another bible study recently and actually asked questions this time rather than taking explanations on blind faith.  She found the responses unsatisfactory.  I thought I'd pose one the questions here for you guys to answer.  I'm trying to remain somewhat neutral in her theological journey - I'd like her to make her decision on her own, but happy to point her towards places like this where she can find satisfactory (non-faith-based) logical explanations.  If you can please explain to her the logical fallacies inherent in this argument, it would be appreciated.  I'm trying to show her this is a sub that she can come to if she has further questions.  Many thanks!

Here is her question:
I. If God is omnipotent, then why has God conducted so many tests of man's will throughout the bible?  An omnipotent being would undoubtedly already know whether man was going to pass or fail prior to the test.

The study guide explained to her that God chooses to limit his ability to see the future.  This did not sit well with her and I suggested to pose it here for the group to respond.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: As others have pointed out below, this questions God's omniscient capacity rather than omnipotent capacity.

Al ot of you are saying people from all religions die for their beliefs like Al Qaeda etc. But those people are having faith, hypothetically, if the disciples did exist, they weren't relying on truth but ""proof"" from Jesus. The authors of the bible were essentially the creators of Christianity. They aren't basing their belief on what someone told them, but what they ""saw"". Now, as atheist, you have to believe that the authors of the gospel were lying when they wrote about the miracles of Jesus (eg: turning a basket of fish into 5000). But if they were lying, then they wouldn't martyr themselves for a lie *they told* (which doesn't even benefit them.) 



Now if you noticed, i put ""hypothetically existed."" So what if they didn't exist and their martyrdom was also fake. 
Well here's a list of secular sources which document the existence are martyrdom of the authors of the gospels: 


- Tacitus  (a roman)

- Flavius Josephus.

- Citations from Lost Documents.

- Rabbinic Literature

- Other Early Graeco-Roman Sources.

I have been thinking about this question ever since I had a debate with a religious friend of mine.  Before I was an atheist, I was always pretty big on human rights and absolute morals, but I didn't attribute them to God necessarily.

I became an atheist for all of the usual reasons like a lack of evidence, the abundant evidence that man created religion, and my refusal to just take things on faith.  As I became more educated, I saw that science had an explanation for almost everything, and even where science didn't have the answer, I was compelled to trust the scientific method as opposed to just attributing mysteries to God's mysterious ways.

My question is, what right do I have to call something right and wrong if there is no authority on the matter?  For instance, I still vehemently believe in many different kinds of human rights, and I believe that those rights are a fundamental part of humanity.  The right I believe in the most is probably equality of opportunity, and yet I'm aware this is entirely a product of being an American and being raised in Western culture.  So is it possible to reconcile being a positive atheist and yet rejecting moral relativism at the same time?  Do I have any power to say something like female genital mutilation is wrong, or is everything relative?  I would appreciate other atheist or agnostic opinions on this.

Religious person here (I identify most closely with Protestantism). 

I recently got into a small debate about religion and the existence of god, and it came down to this:

There are two options, there is a god, or there is not. 

1. If there is not, after we die, our cells die and break down, our bodies degrade, and our consciosness, and therefore our existence, fades from the world. Our entire reality dissappears, and we simply become nothing. 

2. If there is, we have a chance at continuing existence, possibly coming closer to understanding the nature of out existence and the truth of our universe. 

I just don't see why you would opt for option one. It just seems strange to choose to believe that we really are insignificant and that you will someday cease to exist.

 I know I can't prove there is a god, but its always going to be about faith. 

(also, I'm not talking about biblical gods. I don't want bible quotes tossed around in here. I'm talking about a higher power, whatever it may be.)

EDIT: Alright, Pascal's Wager. I get it. I don't hold the same beliefs as this gentleman. He and I are not the same person. Please, I'd appreciate it if you would debate with me and not Pascal.

It goes like so:

1) Atheist accuses God in the Bible of being immoral for sending people to hell, killing them like in the OT, etc.

2) Christian accuses atheist of ""cherrypicking"", because if they're going to criticize God, they have to assume that he exists. If he exists, then you have to accept that he's omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent. If you accept that God is some of these things but not others, then you're cherrypicking the Bible.

3) Since God is defined as omnibenevolent, he decides what is moral and immoral, and since he is the standard for objective morality, he's automatically right and we're automatically wrong. The debater in question even responds when I use a standard such as the pleasure/pain principle that ""no one cares what you think"", because God's perfect and I'm not. When I attack the definition of omnibenevolence as being arbitrary and his conclusion on God circular (since he defined him in such a way where he's perfect and everyone else is wrong), he keeps trying to force this assumption down my throat, saying I HAVE to accept it, lest I be cherrypicking and illogical. To use an example, say you're taking the SAT, it doesn't matter whether you care if Jonny has 3 apples, you have to accept that premise, as is. You can't question it. Since it's how he's defined in the Bible, you have to accept it, period.

4) Also, when i cite God's actions are arbitrary and not based on reason, he just goes on about how we don't know God doesn't have a reason. He's omniscient and we're not, and therefore we don't know what he knows. I know this is an argument from ignorance, and I've called him out on this, but whenever I do, he tells me this is my problem because I have to accept this premise in order to criticize God. He keeps dismissing the fact that these claims have not met a proper burden of proof, and reiterating I have to accept them because to criticize God I have to assume he exists, which means I have to accept those premises.

I know this is a lame gotcha argument. I just wanted to bring it to this subreddit's attention, to see how otheratheists would approach it, since I've gotten into several very long debates with several people over the argument involved, and after going back and forth for literally several hundred posts, I end up giving up out of sheer stubbornness on the other side, and the fact that these guys literally don't care what I have to say. Why do I end up getting in these debates again and again? Because whenever I criticize God's actions in the Bible, they always start the debate again, and when I give up, they go on about how I don't care about logic.

I can go on r/atheism and leave with my faith strengthened from the ignorance I see there, but in subreddits like this one, I see a few legitimately valid points. But even with those points, I'm always left with a few points of my own that leave me clinging to Christianity, and these are the ones I have questions about. First, I don't see how a logical human being can believe in the universe at one time being nothing and then exploding into existence. The only concept that was self created is a deity fitting the description of God. But if you believe the universe was self created, doesn't that make it a deity? For me it's more logical to believe in a deity being responsible for what's all around us, instead what's all around us being the deity itself. Especially considering the amount of evidence, however possibly unreliable and possibly corrupted, in historic documents and the Bible pointing towards a God deity. But again, it's only possible. Likely, unlikely, it's like everything is a possibility. However small the chance. And it's obvious to even atheist and agnostic historians that Jesus was at the least a historic figure of some kind. And it's the Liar Lunatic Lord argument that always makes me rationalize he must be Lord. So I'd say I solidly believe in Creation, and a deity Jesus, not a historic one. But I question the integrity of the Bible itself. It's possible, yet unlikely, that it's 100% truth. And even the strongest Christians will admit it is a 100% truth that's also an incomplete truth. Which makes sense. What part of the truth it has is true, but it's also got many questions left unanswered. Which is fine by me, I'm not omniscient anyway. But the fact of the matter is that the likelihood of the portion of there may be to be uncorrupted is slim. But isn't it still a likelihood, however small? I couldn't be an atheist. Not with these unanswered questions. So, I'm asking for answers, for debate, and possibly even a strengthened faith or a better placed, more specific faith. from answered questions.

AUNT:
1st, know that I love you.  Nothing you ever say, think, believe or do will ever change that.  
Having said that, I think you'd better read up on what you believe before you declare a belief in it.  The theory of evolution (which I can disprove and would love to discuss any time you're ready), makes my life worthless.  In believing this theory, you are believing that I am worth nothing and holding back the human race.  That is the exact theory Hitler worked off of.  Think long and hard before you believe this to be truth.
Regardless, I love you.  And this is breaking my heart more than you could ever begin to imagine.



S.O:
lemme start off by saying that I love you too, very very much.  My belief in the theory of evolution isn't from an uneducated stand point, for the past 3 years I've done extensive research and weighed all opinions and discussions I could lay may hands on before I made anykind of assumptions or beliefs, and frankly Christianity just cant keep up in a world of scientific studies.  I dont mean any disrespect but how are you so sure you can disprove evolution?  The facts of evolution both on the natural adaptations level and on the cellular level are very compelling and the ignorance I find in the church towards a lot of people's hard work is very concerning. This is a topic I would love to discuss with you in person so I wont make this email too lengthy (at work right now). It breaks my heart that you believe life is worthless and meaningless without a diety running the cosmos, although I can relate to those feelings from a few years back but now I see life as that much more precious and fleeting. something to be apreciated every minute of everyday. It seems to me that southland church is heavy on blaming evolution for Hitler's deeds, which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. When I hear someone say that all I think is; okay how about the thousands of ""holy wars"", genocides, genital mutilation, consent of slavery, condoning rape as the spoils of war, etc done in the name Christianity. If you hold evolution accountable for that crime you must hold Christianity to the same standards.
 
I'm sorry I am causing this grief for you, and its for that reason I haven't spoken to anyone in the famly about the way I feel and interpret the bible unitl recently.
 
i would love to discuss this personally with you
 

AUNT: 
Honey, I'm sorry, but all the rapes in the name of war, genocides, etc that you mention were not done in the name of Christianity, but by people that claimed to be acting as Christians, yet did everything the exact opposite of what we are actually taught as Christians.  It is those situations that give Christianity a terrible name, and the enemy a stronghold for non-believers.  The entire Christian community and belief system can not be held responsible for the ridiculously stupid things people have done &amp; claimed in the name of God.  Human error and stupidity can not be blamed on our God.
As far as Hitler goes, you have not quite done enough research.  It is in his very own book, in his very own words where he claims his belief in evolution is why he was attempting to create a superior human race, helping evolution along and eliminating the races of people he hated, the elderly, the sick, and the diseased.  I was not saying you call my life worthless due to a lack of ""diety"", but instead because Hitler said we will help &amp; speed up evolution by killing off the diseased like me.  My arthritis itself is then what evolution would call worthless.  From his belief &amp; evil works, his cousin began eugenics.  That is the elimination of unwanted genes, diseases and deformations by abortion and euthanasia to help evolution along, once again to create the perfect human race.  So by those standards, I should be killed off. And so would all the people that ((Me)) takes care of.
Scientifically, all that has been proven is that there is no true evidence, that there had never been a single ""simple"" cell that could have started life without an outside source (God), and as well, Darwin himself before he died said that the non-existence of proof of the In-between ""evolving"" of species disproves his entire theory.  Aka, he was wrong.  Absolutely none of his theory is based in science, that is by it is called a theory.  The very definition of that word speaks volumes.  Instead they are spending billions to prove this theory to be wrong.  Saving us tons:). All we have to do is sit back and watch it happen.
Christianity isn't supposed to be proven by science.  That's where faith comes in.  Believing in the unseen.  But I can't call it entirely unknown.  I have felt God's presence in my life, He has done incredible things for us.  I don't need science to prove what I can already feel and what we've witnessed in our lives. I just pray you feel that too before it's too late.
(Also, if you're looking for ""proof"", try studying the bible and all the prophecies that are now coming true in Israel and so many other things.  If you want to disprove something you need to know the facts on both sides.  ""there will be wars and rumors of wars...floods, famines, earthquakes,"" etc, etc...  Read your bible, then turn on the news.  All the ""proof"" you'd ever need.)

Ultimately your replies will provide me with advice on how to help him best approach the situation. We all have different styles in debating and I'd like to take in yours !

Having a curious and uneducated mind I wanted to compare what they say to what I find on Reddit.  As I said, I am very uneducated when it comes to evolution so I thought perhaps my friends on Reddit could help me.

The presenter’s aim was to compare both evolution and intelligent design to form predictions based off what the two theories state. He would then take these predictions and compare them to the evidence we find. If you could help me out with responses to these statements I would greatly appreciate it. My friends are taking me to the creation museum in a month and I would enjoy having challenging questions to ask based off the information below. Also don’t feel like you have to answer all 4 questions, if you feel you have a strong argument for only one then please state that and let the others be. I appreciate your help.

1.	Are the building blocks of life simple or complex?

a.	Evolution predicts the basic building blocks of life: amino acids, DNA, RNA, proteins, etc. would be a simple process that gets more complex as life evolves.

b.	Intelligent design predictions of the complexity or simplicity of the building blocks of life can go either way.

c.	The evidence given: based on what we observe in the natural world the evidence leans toward life beginning with complexity and not evolving into complexity- They showed this video ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdBJt6sdDfI&amp;feature=relmfu) to demonstrate the complexity.

i.	Additional claims made during the discussion: How were the cells able to reproduce without this complexity?



2.	Do animal &amp; plant phyla (body types) appear in the beginning or at the end of the timeline? 

a.	Evolution predicts animal and plant phyla will gradually transition or develop into a different species through small changes. Therefore the phyla (body types) will appear gradually over time.

b.	Intelligent design predicts that the a variety of phyla will appear at the same time.

c.	The evidence presented was when we look into the fossil record, during the Cambrian period, there appears to be a sudden appearance of dozens of major complex animal types with no trace of gradual steps.



3.	Do we see evidence of life forms appearing to change over time?

a.	Evolution predicts that we will see transitional changing over time. Darwin predicted innumerable transitions would be found in the fossil record.

b.	Intelligent Design predicts that we will not see transitional changing over time.

c.	To this date no transitional evidence has been found.


4.	Would biological forms come with assembly instructions?

a.	Evolution predicts the amino acids would arise and organize themselves without DNA.

b.	Intelligent design predicts the DNA process would be started by a creator.

c.	The evidence suggests amino acids need DNA to produce proteins. Amino acids have been unable to organize themselves into proteins on their own into a meaningful sequence. The chances of amino acids sequencing themselves into a meaningful code are astronomical in a single celled organism. Better explained in this video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tb6xdaC9hrM&amp;feature=relmfu)

1301408198.0,33,self.DebateAnAtheist,gdxtn,What the Ontological Argument means,johnflux,36,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/gdxtn/what_the_ontological_argument_means/,"Hi guys,

  A few times the Ontological Argument has come up, and debate seems (to me) to get a lost a bit because not everyone knows what the words in philosophy mean, and because they don't even have a clear meaning in philosophy.

**'possibly'**: This has TWO different meanings:

1. We don't know if something is true or not.  e.g. It's possible that P=NP.  We don't know.
2. Something really is possible - the universe allows it.  For physical things, this would be like saying it's possible for me to wiggle my toes.  I may or may not do it, but if I wanted to I absolutely could.

The ontological argument uses the second definition, but using it in a way that sounds like the first.  As an analogy, under the second definition I can say ""If P=NP is possible, then P=NP is true"".  This sounds confusing, but is obviously true.  We just don't know if P=NP is ""possibly"".  If the universe allowed P=NP then it's not a logical contradiction, so it must be true.  (This might be slightly confused with something like the Axiom of Choice, but no such confusion is possible for P=NP so let's not go there).

**'necessary'**:  This has TWO different meanings:

1. A necessary truth.  E.g. 1+1=2 is necessary true - it's a logical contradiction if it's not true.  1+x = 2  is contingent - it depends on the value of x for its truth.

2. A necessary being.  This is a 'thing' that must exist in all possible worlds.  Presumably this comes down to the definition of ""exist"" and ""worlds"", and I haven't seen anyone try to define these words properly.

So using the second definition of both, you can see why you can say ""If a necessary being is possible, then it must exist"".  It's like saying ""If P=NP does not lead to any logical contradictions, then P=NP"".  Once you put it like that, it becomes blindingly obvious and nothing to debate about.

**'being'**: This has TWO different meanings:

1. In philosophy it means ""thing"" or some such.  The universe is a ""being"".  A piece of wood is a ""being"".  I haven't seen any proper definition.  Is energy a being?  Is time a being?  I have no idea.

2. In every day usage, it has means something alive.

So again the Ontological Argument ""uses"" this confusion to make you think it's proved a God, rather than the more obvious conclusion that the universe itself is ""the being"" or something like a m-brane  or what have you.

**'contingent'**: This has TWO different meanings:

1. Contingent can mean that it relies on something else for its truth value.  E.g.  3+x = 4   relies on the value of x.

2. Contingent can mean that it relies on something else for its very existence.  E.g. a cat relies on its atoms and the universe around it to exist.

Under the first definition, it's obvious that contingent and necessary are opposites.  A logical statement is either necessary (2+2=4)  or contingent (2+x=4).  It's not at all clear what it means to say that the universe is contingent under this definition.

Under the second definition, it now /sorta/ makes sense to say if the universe is contingent, but it's not at all obvious that it is or isn't contingent.  But something no longer has to be either contingent or necessary under this definition.  For example, you could have something that doesn't rely on anything else for its existence (a bubble universe that just popped out of nowhere for no reason) so it's not contingent, but it didn't have to  (so it's not necessary).

**'maximally great'**: This doesn't seem to mean anything without becoming a tautology. A cookie for anyone that can define this, including any of the terms that they use that differ from a normal dictionary definition. (Including the word morality).

Anyway, so my point is that in future such discussion, the *first* and top voted question should be '**define all your words as exact as you can**'.  Then you can replace those words with the definition that they gave, simplify, and find that there's no argument at all.  The whole argument relies on confusing words.

1369141130.0,28,self.DebateAnAtheist,1erepl,How do you justify the consumption of meat?,SketchyLogic,56,28,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1erepl/how_do_you_justify_the_consumption_of_meat/,"This doesn't strictly relate to the subjects of atheism or religion, but given how this subreddit is full of skeptics with a grasp of logic and ethics, I feel that this thread is suited to here. If there is a more applicable subreddit, I would be happy to move on.

I am not a vegetarian. I enjoy eating meat, and would not be averse to slaughtering my food first-hand, if I were in a situation that required it. But I find it impossible to morally justify my choice to eat meat from a logical standpoint. I've made two assumptions:

1. The deliberate, needless killing of an animal is a morally reprehensible act. I certainly wouldn't argue that an animal's life has equal worth to a human's, or that we are obliged to sweep the ground at our feet to reduce the killing of ants, but I don't think I could be convinced that the act of killing of an animal for the express purposes of mild convenience or fun is morally justified. To clarify here: I wouldn't consider the death of field mice in the harvesting of wheat to be immoral, because the death of field mice is an unfortunate, unavoidable consequence of a wholly separate act (the harvesting of wheat); by contrast, the ""harvesting"" of pork directly necessitates the killing of a pig.
2. Most humans living in the Western world are fully capable of healthily living on vegetarian or vegan diets. Soy, oats, nuts, spinach, and similar foods are rich in nutrients that make up the vast majority of what you lose from not eating meat.

If the two assumptions hold true, then it must follow that anyone choosing to eat meat for the purpose of convenience or deliciousness would surely be participating in an immoral act.

The best personal argument I can come up with is one of utility. That is, the tastiness and convenience provided to me justifies the loss of the animal's life. But this is terribly weak reasoning, as it seems to imply that tastiness is somehow a measure of good, so much so that enough of it can justify any evil act. This line of thinking also leads to bizarre situations when extrapolated - if one meal provides a certain amount of tastiness, would whale therefore be the most ethical food to eat, due to its high meat-per-death ratio?

I think this issue bothers me so much because I am knowingly going against something that I can't morally justify on a daily basis. If I have no respect for my own moral reasoning, then what purpose does the reasoning serve, other than mental masturbation?

I would be happy to hear your thoughts.

**Edit:** I've been getting a lot of great replies, but I've also had a lot of questionable ones too. Some of the most common arguments in this thread have been:

&gt;It's delicious.

This is inarguable. But unfortunately this is not a moral justification.

&gt;It's biological/natural/we've been doing it for thousands of years.

This is the naturalistic fallacy. It is a terrible argument with no grounding in observable evidence, and can be used to justify everything from herbal medicine to gay-hating. Stop using it.

&gt;I need it.

There are vegetarian Olympic athletes. You do not *need* meat; it is just the most convenient way of receiving the necessary amino acids.

&gt;I am a moral relativist / I do not care for morals.

Fantastic, but this does not address my dilemma.

&gt;You don't seem to have a problem with killing plants...

This is debatable, but most people draw a clear legal, moral, and philosophical distinction between the lives of humans, animals, and plants. We are similar biologically, but divided by factors like intelligence and consciousness.

The better arguments below have taken a consequentialist standpoint, pointed out that the difference in the evils committed between a vegetarian and a meat-eating diet are not so different, and that therefore such a distinction is placed arbitrarily. I don't know if I'm convinced by this view (I suppose because I place a greater value on intent), but it is a much more valid approach than the above arguments.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,1369360805.0,,,True,t3_1erepl,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1erepl/how_do_you_justify_the_consumption_of_meat/,
1366296470.0,32,self.DebateAnAtheist,1clwdh,Young Earth Creation (AMA),tmgproductions,187,155,1272,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1clwdh/young_earth_creation_ama/,"Your mod **Pstrder** encouraged me to post.  I’d rather make this a little more like an Ask-Me-Anything if you are interested.  If insulted, I will not respond.

I am a young-earth creationist.  I believe the world was created in six literal days approx. 6000 years ago by God and those methods are accurately recorded in the pages of the Bible.  I believe God cursed that original creation following original sin and forever altered it to resemble more of what we observe today.  I believe a worldwide flood decimated the world approx. 4300 years ago.  I do not believe there is a single piece of evidence in the world that contradicts these positions.  

I do acknowledge that there are many interpretations and conclusions about evidence that contradicts these positions, but I believe those positions are fundamentally flawed because they have ignored the witness testimony that I mentioned above.  I believe science itself works.  I believe sciences that deal with historical issues are much different than modern observational sciences.  I see historical sciences (like origins) like piecing together a crime scene to find out what happened.  If we tried to piece together what happened at a Civil War battlefield by just using the rocks/bones left behind we would probably get a coherent, compelling story – but when you add in the eyewitness testimony it completely alters the story.  In science we call it adding additional information.  I believe the creationist position has additional information that alters the current story of origins.

Here is the **TL;DR** of my entire position:

1.	Creationists and evolutionists have the same evidence (same bones, same rocks, same earth), but come to different conclusions due to different starting assumptions used to explain the evidence. 

2.	Evolutionists have a starting assumption of uniformitarianism of geology and biology.  This basically means that the rates and processes we measure today have remained constant and unchanged for all of history.

3.	Creationists have a starting assumption of catastrophism.  This basically means that if the Bible is true, then there are three very important events (a 6-day literal creation, a cursed world following original sin, and a worldwide flood) that intrude and disrupt the assumption of uniformitarianism. 

4.	Therefore, if the Bible is true – uniformitarianism fails, and so do all conclusions (macro-evolution, old-earth) that flow from that assumption.  

I do not believe any form of theistic evolution is logically defendable.  I believe the only defendable positions are YEC or Atheism.  Granted, I fully accept and realize that my starting assumption is that the Bible is true.  I do not wish to make this entire thread about if the Bible is true or not (like every other thread) but for conversation purposes here is my abbreviated position on that:  

1.	Science would not be possible in an evolutionary worldview (constants/laws cannot evolve), therefore they must come from an intelligent mind.

2.	The God of the Bible is the only account with a God that exists outside of time, space, and matter (first cause) and has a thoroughly documented historical creation account that works with the evidence we see today.

I realize all these positions raise many more questions.  I have written a FAQ of the Top 20 questions I normally get about creation/evolution[here]( http://gracesalt.wordpress.com/faq/).  I have also expanded on my defense of the Bible [here]( http://gracesalt.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/is-the-bible-really-reliable/).  I will be happy to answer any questions here as long as the tone of conversation remains cordial.  For example “what do you make of chalk deposits”, “what do you make of radiometric dating”, etc.  Thanks! 

I will not entertain comments such as:  “just go take a class”, “it’s people like you who…”, “everyone knows ____”, etc.  Those are easy logical fallacies.  There is never a justification for undermining someone’s belief system.  I have laid out my beliefs.  Feel free to respectfully ask clarifying questions.

**EDIT** - because of the amount of replies I will not be able to comment on multi-pointed questions.  Please pick your favorite, the others have probably already been asked.  Thanks!

**EDIT 2**  - I'd be interested to hear if anything I presented here made you consider something you never had before.  I'm not looking for conversions, merely things that made you go hmmm.  Feel free to message me if you'd rather.

**EDIT 3** - I apologize if I did not respond to you, especially if we've been going back n forth for a while.  Everytime I check my messages it says I have 25, but I know its more than that - I just think that's the limit Reddit sends me at a time.  When the thread calms down I will go back through every comment and jump back in if I missed it.

**EDIT 4**  - per Matthew 10:14, if I stop conversing with you it does not imply that I do not have an answer, it more than likely means that I have put forth my answer already and it has been ignored.

**EDIT 5** - I realized since my comments are being massively downvoted that it may seem as if I am not commenting on anything asked.  I assure you I have (including the top post), I've commented over 300 times now and will continue to but they may not show up at a first glance since they are being downvoted too far.

**FINAL EDIT 6** - I will continue to slowly from time to time work through many of the comments here.  I have in no way ignored any that I feel brought up a new question or point that hasn't been mentioned several times already.  I wanted to wrap this up with **one more attempt to clarify my position:**

It usually turns into something that isn't productive.  I'll give it another shot:

If there is not Supreme Being or a Prime Mover, what started the creation process?  Everything in the universe is moved by something else.  There is nothing that moves on it's own.  Everything is the result of something else.  This being the case, what is the scientific basis that says creation is a lone entity that started without something else?

Edit: Just so there is no confusion about where I'm coming from I am a devout Catholic.  I believe in evolution, science, and everything else most atheist do about the creation of everything.  The main difference is I believe God started everything.

Edit 2 :  This seems to be coming up often so I'll address it here.  I keep getting the question of how was God created.  I don't believe God was created for the simple fact that there must be something that is eternal and un-created for existence to even happen.  If there isn't an un-existed entity, then there was never a beginning, something everyone can disagree with.

ME: I can't. I'm a developer, not a scientist. I'd need tools to measure the air. And saying I can't leave my chair is a weird constraint. I'm sure I could find a lot of information about the nature of air.

HIM: So you're not sure there's oxygen in the air?

ME: No, I'm sure there is. There's an overwhelming amount of evidence of there being oxygen in air.

HIM: But you can't prove it. So you only *believe* there's oxygen in air. There's no such thing as a scientific fact. All claims have doubt, so all claims are beliefs. It used to be a scientific fact that it was impossible for humans to have an airborne aircraft, but look at us today! It used to be a scientific fact that the universe was constant, but now it's relative!

ME: What exactly are you trying to prove? Science has never claimed to be infallible, and science constantly seeks to root out false claims.

HIM: What I'm saying is that scientific ""fact"" is absolutely worthless. Scientists can't be sure that what they're saying is the truth, so why believe them at all when they say anything? It could change in 10 years from now. They could be throwing out pure bull right now. The universe might not even be relative!

**--&gt; So how do you react to such nonsense? I feel like there's not much of an argument to hold on to here. So his opinion is that scientific fact is worthless. How can I attribute worth to science? Or is this just malarky I shouldn't even bother trying to argue?**

----------------------------

**Arg B**

HIM: But even if science is worthless, it does serve to prove religion true time and time again.

ME: How so?

HIM: Well, religion proved that there could be multiple universes. In the Bible it makes references to a Kingdom of God and a Kingdom of Heaven (ED: [Luke 17:20-21](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+17%3A20-21&amp;version=NIV), [John 18:36](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2018:36&amp;version=NIV)). These are the other universes. Science proved that there could be multiple universes, so science proved religion true. And that's not the only time! People used to joke about the God concept - ""How can God be everywhere at once? Religion is bull"", ya know? But here comes along Einstein who says that if someone can travel faster than the speed of light, he could be everywhere at once. That proves that God can be everywhere at once - omnipresent. Science seeks to prove what religious people knew all along, so we religious people just wait and wait and eventually Science comes around to the right conclusion - like a four year old.

**--&gt; Fairly sure this is an ex nihilo argument. He never really attached ""faster than light travel"" to ""There's God!"" Plus I think he's playing both sides - science is good where it suits him - science is bad where it doesn't suit him.**

---------------------------

**Arg C**

HIM: So let's say I did allow you to leave your chair to find information about oxygen in the air. Where would you look?

ME: Scientific journals. EBSCO. Online databases.

HIM: But then you'd be doing the exact same thing I'm doing. I know God is the answer, and I find relevant information in the Bible and life experience that proves my belief. You know that oxygen is in the air, so you look for the answers in a scientific journal. What's the difference?

ME: The scientific journals are backed by peer review, the scientific method, and multiple independent tests. Your life experiences and bible don't have these things.

HIM: Scientific method? How worthless.

ME: Oh, you have something better? Please, do go on. Any scientist would love to hear about it.

HIM: The scientific method makes an assumption that God doesn't exist at the outset which biases its opinion and all those who follow it. Any true scientific method should include God in it.

ME: You can put God in the scientific method. It's possible. Just put in for the hypothesis ""God exists"" and then seek to prove or disprove that. The problem is that you can't prove or disprove it with the scientific method. It's impossible.

HIM: Exactly my problem with it. God should be provable by the scientific method, but the science community doesn't allow it to be possible. Any scientific method should include the possibility that God is present because he *is* real.

A friend told me on youtube to meet here, so that I could be informed as to how belief in God is illogical and therefore laughable. I invite respectful conversation at this time, on the following points:

1. ""You believe in one of thousands of man-made gods"" is a misuse of the word God for theists. Since God is not created, this critique is counter to the uses of the term under debate.

2. Belief in God may or may not be logical, depending upon what we mean. If logic consists of a summary examination of physical evidence (i.e. science), I concede the point but wonder how one avoids material reductionism in this framework. If, on the other hand, subjective experience is admissible, and experience of the numinous might be said to occur, how is such belief illogical?

3. Logic derives from the assumption that humans can critique that which is posited. But God, for a monotheist, cannot be attacked, known, dissected, or otherwise evaluated - God is transcendent and therefore beyond logical analysis. Can logic be used in theology despite this understanding, and if so, what are its limits?

I am often accused of being closed-minded and biased, even though I try very hard to respond to people who challenge what I believe and consider what they're saying. These same people however, will reject my arguments and say that I am biased, because I cannot offer any ""proof"". Here's what I'm wondering:

1) Everyone uses arguments to support their claims, so is the atheist not just as biased as the Christian (Continue to 2, because I'll expand on this)?

2) I've seen a very prevailing argument that the Bible is not supported by proof outside of itself (archaeologically, historically, other writings, etc), but this **is** **not** true. However, when I offer proof to this extent, I am immediately shot down because of my ""bias"". Why should I accept proofs from people who don't believe the Bible if you aren't willing to listen to the proof from those who do?

3) Almost every atheist I've debated appeals to science for evidence. Does science explain everything? Do you accept anything that is unexplained? If Jesus actually came to you personally and performed a miracle in your presence would you believe him (be honest; this is an argument I've heard a lot)?

I know these are heavy questions, so don't worry if your responses are lengthy--I will take the time to read them fully and I'll respond as best I can. Thanks.

**EDIT**: Thanks for all your responses. I'm trying to respond to everyone but that's going to take some time, so I appreciate your patience and I'm sorry if I overlook anyone.

**EDIT** **2**: I should have thought to do this in the first place, but here are a few resources that some of you have asked me for. I understand most of these are arguing from a Christian perspective, but I have looked at them closely and I think if you are willing to take a look you'll see that they are *not* *necessarily* biased because of this. I would just encourage you to take a look and then tell me if/why they're biased.

(I've been lambasted by some for using the term before, believe it or not, so I'll define it: The New Atheism is the moniker given by the media to Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, etc. It is not an attempt to label atheism as being a recent position, or whatever).

But here's the deal: I see a lot of atheists saying ""I'm not interested in philosophy. It doesn't say anything useful about anything and is a waste of time. Why would I want to study philosophy."" I've heard this sort of thing being used by Dawkins on multiple occasions to defend his lack of education in philosophy: Not only does he not know anything about it, but he's not interested in knowing anything about it. I wish I could post specific instances of him saying this, but unfortunately my memory isn't good enough to pinpoint certain moments in a two-hour debate. I seem to recall his debate with the Archbishop of Canterbury featuring this a bit. Hopefully someone else will be able to corroborate.

There's also the ""Black Cat Analogy,"" the main message of which seems to be ""LULZ SCIENCE FTW! PHILOSOPHY IS FOR NAVAL GAZING IDIOTS!"" It's a hideous straw-man but apparently it gets people interested?

Anyway, the big issue here is that atheism itself is a philosophical position. You might say ""No! I'm an atheist because of science, not philosophy!"" but that's misleading and fallacious. All science is really capable of doing is observing, when you get right down to it. To say ""According to our current evidence, the universe seems to operate in x fashion"" is science. To say ""According to our current evidence, the universe seems to operate in x fashion, therefore God doesn't exist"" is philosophy. It may be a philosophical proposition rooted in scientific evidence, but it is a philosophical proposition nonetheless.

Let's take things a bit beyond that: Science itself, in order to function at all, or even approach coherence, depends on a foundation of philosophical presuppositions that cannot be proven. Presuppositions such as: Our senses accurately portray reality, the world around us actually exists, etc. Most egregiously, the common statement ""The only way we can know something for sure is if it can be scientifically proven"" cannot itself be scientifically proven and is therefore self-negating - it attempts to establish an epistemology that does not measure up to its own standards.

Let's delve into things historically for a bit. What we call science is actually something that was originally known as natural philosophy - or the study of the world around us. As such, science has it's roots in philosophy. Similarly, many of the greatest atheist thinkers, who have done the most for the cause of atheism, were philosophers, not scientists (I am thinking of the likes of Camus, Sartre, and, of course, Nietzsche).

So all of this leads me to question: Why does it seem that many atheists have such a derisive attitude towards philosophy?

I probably won't offer up my full rebuttal but will add my own commentary.  Anyway I guess we can kick it off with the introduction (that I just finished). 

**The Reason for God**:*Belief in an Age of Skepticism*

by Timothy Keller

**Introduction**

The introduction is mostly just a background of the author so I will skip over all of that, but he does begin to formulate an argument that we could address.   The subsection in the introduction where the argument begins is titled ""A Second Look at Doubt""  and I quote,

&gt;People who blithely go through life too busy or indifferent to ask hard questions about why they believe as they do will find themselves defenseless against either the experience of tragedy or the probing questions of a smart skeptic.

I think I might like this author.  And we continue...

&gt;... skeptics must learn to look for a type of faith hidden within their reasoning.  All doubts, however skeptical and cynical they may seem, are really a set of alternate beliefs.

He really tries to emphasize this point.

&gt;Every doubt, therefore, is based on a leap of faith.

He tries to encapsulate the attitude of an atheist here,

&gt;""My doubts are not based on a leap of faith.  I have no beliefs about God one way or another. I simply feel no need for God and I am not interested in thinking about it.""

I don't feel like this captured my attitude, but I guess he was just trying to give one example.  He further claims that...

&gt;The only way to doubt Christianity rightly and fairly is to discern the alternate belief under each of your doubts and then ask yourself what reasons you have for believing it... In fairness you must doubt your doubts.

He concludes this line of thought by explaining that the only way to rise to a level of disagreement where real discussion can be had...

&gt; ... each side [must] learn to represent the other's argument in its strongest and most positive form.

I really like the tone of the author and completely agree with the first quote and the last but I don't think the author himself has done what he encourages us to do.  However this is just the introduction and we haven't gotten into the real arguments, so maybe it will get better.

Anyway I would like to here you thoughts up to this point?  What do you think of Kellers concept that all doubts have, as he puts it, ""their own faith-foundations""?

My question is simple, if atheists don't have all the answers to how life started how can you say a believer like myself is wrong? I believe I have the answer as to why I'm here and why things happen, I believe it to be the true answer like I believe 1+1 = 2 

Do I understand EVERYTHING, of course not- but I know how big I relative to this huge/infinite universe and will never comprehend every thing that happens or happened. I will tell you this, I feel like my faith gives me answers and guidance but atheism just seems so empty to me.

Id be lying if I said I wasn't fascinated with Atheism. I can just look at an orange and appreciate God and religion. I'm very serious- the proof for me that God exists is all around me, I know you dont see it that way though and I want to know why. My religion tells me some of the non-believers have a veil or curtain over their hearts and that's why they can't see what I see. 

I feel like I went off track here, let me clarify my question. What does an anteist feel when they see the stars and moon, what do you feel when you look the anomy of the human body , or when you see a catapliier turning into a butterfly.

**In Conclusion** I noticed many comments on science and posts like "" how can you believe in God and not evolution or science"", its almost like Reddit never heard of a religious scientist. I and Islam embrace and love science, of course I know I was an embryo and and grew into a fetus etc etc but I still believe God created me ( that process) etc. 

I have a soul and spirit, I feel and love, these are things you can't see but how can I prove to you I have them? I'm not just organic material that dies like a plant.

Why do people still argue that Agnosticism has legs to stand on without first mentioning the subject of the claim? You can't make a knowledge claim without first stating it is about God, and then stating your belief, and finally how you know (gnosticism), or do not know (agnosticism).

This all seems perfectly fine and inclusive and I thought it was the consensus according to most who deal with these topics. Philosophers, apologists, etc

**Chapter 5 - How can a Loving God send People to Hell**

&gt;*""I doubt the existence of a judgmental God who requires blood to pacify his wrath"", said a [student]. ""Someone had to die before the Christian God would pardon us.""*

and stated by some other random person

&gt;*""But I have even more of a problem with the doctrine of hell.""*

So these are the argument Keller will attempt to refute.   What I find interesting about this chapter is Keller's complete side step of the first quote.  He never comes back to it.  He instead reframes the argument and only addresses the points he wants to

&gt;Our culture has no problem with a God of love who supports us no matter how we live.  It does, however, object strongly to the idea of a God who punishes people for their sincerely held beliefs, even if they are mistaken.  

and

&gt;Westerners get upset by the Christian doctrines of hell

Durring my first read through I had not even noticed this evasion of the original question.  It was only after I went back and looked at my notes did I notice this.  The reason I find it frustrating is because that was the bigger argument in my opinion.  Why did he even bring up the concern if he was not going to address it?  Does he even realize thats what he did?  Did anyone proof read this before he published it? 

Anyway, Keller starts this chapter off with what might be the most insane position thus far.  

&gt;[C.S.] Lewis desribes [the] impulse (that lead to modernity) -- a new approach to moral and spiritual reality.  

&gt;*The serious magical endeavor and the serious scientific endeavor are twins: one was sickly and died, the other was strong and throve.  But they are twins.  They were born of the same impulse.*

&gt;*For magic and applied science alike the problem is how to subdue reality to the wishes of men: the solution is a technique; and both, in the practive of this technique, are ready to do things therto regarded as disgusting and impious...*

Keller continues

&gt;In ancient times it was understood that there was a transcendent moral order outside the self, built in to the fabric of the universe.

&gt;Modernity reversed this. Ultimate reality was seen not so much as a supernatural order but as the natural world, and that was malleable. Instead of trying to shape our desires to fit reality, we now seek to control and shape reality to fit our desires. 

&gt;Our new confidence that we can control the physical environment has spilled over so we now think we can reshape the metaphysical realm as well.  It seems to our minds unfair, therefore, that we should determine that it is all right to have sex outside of marriage and later discover that there is a God who is going to punish us for that.

WHAT?  I have NO idea what Keller is talking about.  It sounds like he is confusing science and the scientific method with technology.  Keller keeps outdoing himself. Keller shifts gears after this complete misrepresentation of science with the only Christian arguments that ever work, presuppositions. 

&gt;For the sake of argument, let's imagine Christianity is not the product of any one culture but is actually the transcultural truth of God.  If that were the case... it would contradict... human culture... and correct your thinking at some place.  

... good old presuppositionalism.  Include the conclusion in the premise and the logic works!! What other logical fallacies can we commit today?  

&gt;""How can a God of love be also a God filled with wrath and anger?""

&gt;I always start my response by pointing out that all loving persons are sometimes filled with wrath...

He then goes on to show how anger is an expression of love. 

&gt;those who believe in a god of judgement... if you believe in a god who smites... god of love...

All of Keller's arguments ignore non-belief.  This has been a common thread throughout the book but its downright frustating when he constantly references 'skepticism'.   Anyway...

This baseless assertion was interesting

&gt;Volf reasons that it is a lack of belief in a god of vengeance that ""secretely nourishes violence.""...   victims of violence are drawn to go far beyond justice into the vengeance... If I don't believe that there is a God who will eventually put all things right, I *will* take up the sword...

Well lets hope Keller never loses his faith.   I almost forgot he does give a shout out to atheism...well almost at least. 

&gt;Milosz had personally seen, in both Nazism and Communism, that a loss of belief in a God of Judgment can lead to brutality.

The last few pages of the chapter Keller begins to answer the Hell question by sharing his more liberal interpretation of Hell and honestly it doesn't sound that bad.  

&gt;hell is simply one's freely chosen identity apart from God on a trajectory into infinity.

He then puts his psychologist hat on, 

&gt;When we build our lives on anything but God, that thing -- though a good thing -- becomes an enslaving addiction

and then presumes my will.

&gt;No one ever asks to leave hell.  The very idea of heaven seem to them a sham... All God does in the end with people is give them what they most want

Keller conclude is arrogant fashion.

&gt;the source of the idea that God is Love is the Bible itself.

by  TIMOTHY KELLER

Chapter 1 - *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*

Now don't let the heading decieve you, Keller is going to attempt to refute that position.   

The biggest objection to Christianity (according to Keller) is one of *exclusivity*.   Keller refutes the claim that ''all religions are equally valid"" pretty early on (and I agree with his refutation).  Keller recalls a panel discussion he participated in where he was the Christian representiative.  

&gt;Each speaker affirmed that there were significant, irreconcilable differences between the major faiths... ""If Christians were right about Jesus being God, then Muslims and Jews fail in a serious way to love God as God really is (and vice versa)""

Keller repeats again and again that not all religions can be true or at least equally true, however it was very frustrating that he never once mentions the possibility that they are all wrong.   Rather than going to deep into this concept Keller decides to shift the focus towards ""three approaches that civic and cultural leaders arround the world are using to address the divisiveness of religion.""  He seems to have no interest in debating truth claims head on and instead insists on refuting the effectiveness of social/political movements against religion.  The three approaches (he seemed to think these were the only three) are to outlaw religion, condemn religion, and privatize religion.

**(1) Outlaw religion**

&gt;There have been several massive efforts to [outlaw religion] in the twentieth century. Soviet Russia, Communist China, etc... The result, however, was not more peace and harmony, but more oppression.

After his intro to the topic he gets more precise as to what he would like to put to rest.

&gt;But as we become more scientifically sophisticated and more able to understand and control our own environment, our need for religion would diminish, it was thought.

&gt;But this has not happened, and this ""secularization thesis"" is now largely discredited.

The evidence Keller provides to refute that the world is becomming more secular because of scientific progress is random growth statitics for specifc Christian denominations is specific parts of the world.

&gt;There are now six time more Anglicans in Nigeria alone than there are in all of the US... more Presbyterians in Ghana than in the US &amp; Scotlan combined. Korea has gone from 1 percent to 40 percent Christian in a hundred years, and experts think the same is going happen in China...[thats] half a billion Chinese Christians in fifty years...

Keller concludes with what I think to a be a particularly humorous comment. 
 
&gt;Everyone wants to think that they are in the mainstream, that they are not extremists.  But robust religious beliefs dominate the world.  There is no reason to expect that to change.  

**(2) Condemn religion**

&gt;can't we via education and argument... socially discourage religions that claim...""the truth"" and [proselytize]... Couldn't we find ways to urge  [everybody] to admit that each... faith ist just one of many equally valid paths to God?

Keller spends the next five pages constantly reaffirming that the above position is the position of the skeptic.

&gt;Skeptics believe that *any* exclusive claims to superior knowledge of spiritual reality cannot be true.

He never makes an attempt to represent the atheist position.  For the most part I agree with Keller that this position is absurd but rather than using logic (which he kind of did at the very beginning of the chapter with his mutual exclusivity remark) to refute this obviously impossible position he insists on very solopsist like argumentation. (is that a thing?) 

&gt;Plantinga and Berger make the same point.  You can't say, ""All claims about religions are historically conditioned except the one I am making right now."" If you insist that no one can determine which beliefs are right and wrong, why should we believe what you are saying?

He refutes John Hick in similiar fashion.

&gt;... the statement ""all religious claims to have a better view of things are arrogant and wrong"" to be, on its own terms, arrogant and wrong.

Keller finishes off this section by repeating the claim [see my last post discussing the introduction] that doubts and objections are just 'alternate faith' claims.  

**(3) Keep religion completely private.**

&gt;Influential thinkers such as John Rawls and Robert Audi have argued that, in public political discussions, we may not argue for a moral position unless it has a secular, nonreligious grounding.

Alright finally touching on something I kind of agree with, lets see where he takes it.

&gt;Religion-based positions are seen as sectarian and controversial, while secular reasoning for moral positions are seen as universal and available to all... We should keep our religious view to ourselves and unite around policies that ""work"" best for the most people.

Finally he hits on a line of reasoning that I agree with for the most part.  Lets see how he refutes it.   Sure we aren't really talking about truth claims and are instead talking politics but at least I feel like he is finally debating me.  This section really was a breath of fresh air when I started to read it.  

&gt;Stephen L. Carter of Yale [argues] that it is impossible...""[such a demand] will always in the end say to those of organized religion that they alone, unlike everbody else, must enter the public dialogue only after leaving behind that part of themselves that they may consider the most vital.""

Keller then tries to argue that all beliefs are 'religious.'  

&gt;For example, some think that this material world is all there is, that we are here by accident and when we die we just rot, and therefore the important thing is to choose to do what makes you happy and not let others impose their beliefs on you.  Notice that this is not an explicit... religion... [however] it is a set of faith-assumptions about the nature of things.  It is an implicit religion.

&gt; ...all of our most fundamental convictions about things are beliefs that are nearly impossible to justify to those who don't shares them.  Secular concepts such as ""self-realization"" and ""autonomy"" are impossible to prove and are ""coversation stoppers"" just as much as appeals to the Bible.

Ahhhhh, the theist ace in the hole.  When all else fails argue solopsism.  Didn't think he would go all the way there, but I guess he kept hinting at it.   So what exactly is your point... since we now can both agree that we have equally bad reasons to believe what we believe (I don't actually concede that point but that seems to be what he is arguing)... where do we go from here?

&gt;This leads legal theorist, Michael J. Perry, to conclude that it is ""quixotic, in any event, to attempt to contruct an airtight barrier between religious [and secular] discourse...

(the way he wrote it in the book was to remind is the secular reasoning was just implicit religious reasoning)  So let me summarize.  We both have equally terrible reasons to believe what we believe and since we can't remove personal bias from conversation we shouldn't even try.

I have been waffling on my beliefs for quite some time, but about 3 years ago I finally realized I was atheist.  I did a lot of reading, and had a lot of logical ideas come to light.  Until about 2 months ago, I was sure there was nothing else out *there*, wherever that may be.

Now, I'm wavering in my atheism, pretty hard.  I'd consider myself a pantheist at this point.  I'd like to bring up a few points of contention for me, and see what you guys/gals think.

Firstly, the idea of a universal ""architect.""  When you build a skyscraper, it is designed and built.  Is the idea of this completely dismissible in atheism?  Could it be possible that a more powerful force than ourselves caused the universe to end up the way it did?  I don't mean a god as in the abrahamic sense, but something that could have created the universe to have the fundamental forces that we understand.

Secondly, dark matter.  It boggles the mind.  It and dark energy make up roughly 95% of the entire universe, but we can't see it.  We don't know what it is, how it works, if there is more than one kind, the only thing we know is it's gravitational effect, which in turn gives us it's mass.  How can we, as clever monkeys at best, suggest there is nothing more to see past the 5 senses we have?  We haven't even figured out the 5% of the universe we *can* observe.

Finally, the religious trappings of atheism.  Atheism does suffer from some of the same problems that religions do.  Religious folks close themselves off from everything else because they ""know"" they are right.  Atheism, unintentionally, can do the same.  Yes, you are open to new facts that come about from scientific endeavors, yes, you are open to logic.  But on the flip side of that, atheism closes some of the same doors that religion does.  I don't think the human perception of a religious-level experience should just be filed away as a chemical reaction in a squishy organ.  Religions, as in capital-R Religions, are crap.  But that doesn't mean people shouldn't have a spiritual side, nor should they just discount their experiences.  The experience is real to that person. I get the argument that anecdotal evidence is not evidence.  However when people have certain mental experiences, doors open to other corridors of thought.  

Anyway, I think I had an existential crisis the other day.  The right combination of thoughts, experiences, and mental state made me realize that maybe I don't understand the fabric of reality as well as I thought.  I can't call myself an atheist any longer.  We are all part of something more amazing than our individual selves, and just maybe people have tuned in to this channel and couldn't understand it, or couldn't explain it.  A true experience like that would be ineffable.  

Sorry if this is a bit rambling, I'm still trying to piece my brain back together, and trying to work at a job that very quickly lost any sense of importance.

**EDIT**  Whoah!  Way more response than I was expecting.  I'll have to get home before I really start replying.  A couple things real quick:  I don't believe in god, per se.

&gt;contends that omniscience and free will are incompatible, and that any conception of God that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently contradictory.



[Argument from inconsistent revelations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_inconsistent_revelations)

&gt;It asserts that it is unlikely that God exists because many theologians and faithful adherents have produced conflicting and mutually exclusive revelations. The argument states that since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponent, and there is no way for a mere mortal to resolve these conflicting claims by investigation, it is prudent to reserve one's judgment.



[Argument from nonbelief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_nonbelief)

&gt;The premise of the argument is that if God existed (and wanted humanity to know it), he would have brought about a situation in which every reasonable person believed in him; however there are reasonable unbelievers, and therefore this weighs against God's existence.



[Argument from poor design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design)

&gt;It is based on the following chain of reasoning:

    An omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent creator God would create organisms that have optimal design.

    Organisms have features that are suboptimal.

    Therefore, God either did not create these organisms or is not omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent.

&gt;The argument is structured as a basic Modus tollens: if ""creation"" contains many defects, then design is not a plausible theory for the origin of our existence. It is most commonly used in a weaker way, however: not with the aim of disproving the existence of God, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which runs as follows:

    Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.

    Therefore, life must have been created by an intelligent creator.

    This creator is God.



[Atheist's Wager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist%27s_Wager)

&gt;You should live your life and try to make the world a better place for your being in it, whether or not you believe in god.

If there is a benevolent god, he will judge you on your merits and not just on whether or not you believed in him.

[God of the gaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)

&gt;God of the gaps is a type of theological fallacy in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence. The term was invented by Christian theologians not to discredit theism but rather to discourage reliance on teleological arguments for God's existence.



[Incompatible-properties argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible-properties_argument)

&gt;The incompatible-properties argument is the idea that no description of God is consistent with reality. For example, if one takes the definition of God to be described fully from the Bible, then the claims of what properties God has described therein might be argued to lead to a contradiction.



[Omnipotence paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox)

&gt;The paradox states that if a being can perform any action, then it should be able to create a task it is unable to perform, and hence, it cannot perform all actions. Yet, on the other hand, if it cannot create a task it is unable to perform, then there exists something it cannot do.



[Problem of evil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil)

&gt;In the philosophy of religion, the problem of evil is the question of how to explain evil if there exists a deity that is omnibenevolent, omnipotent, and omniscient. Some philosophers have claimed that the existences of such a god and of evil are logically incompatible or unlikely.



[Problem of Hell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_Hell)

&gt;The ""Problem of Hell"" is a possible ethical problem related to religions in which portrayals of Hell are ostensibly cruel, and are thus inconsistent with the concepts of a just, moral and omnibenevolent God.



[Russell's teapot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot)

The argument for the ""weak atheist"" position is essentially that there is not compelling evidence for the existence of God, and since I agree with this, I consider myself a ""weak atheist"". I am interested in hearing the ""strong atheist"" (or antitheist) argument demonstrating that there are in fact no gods.

I can imagine a valid argument that the supposed attributes of a certain conception of God are self-contradictory, which would seem to demonstrate that God cannot exist with that definition, but I have not been able to demonstrate that *no gods* exist. I guess this means that (unsurprisingly) definitions will probably be important.

**TL;DR:** The phrase ""it's impossible to prove that God *doesn't* exist"" is often thrown around, but that seems to be exactly what strong atheists are claiming to do. I would like to hear this argument.

**UPDATE**: Thanks for the good input so far. I think part of the confusion has been about what being a ""strong atheist"" actually means. For the sake of having a common reference point, let's try using [Richard Dawkins' ""Spectrum of Theistic Probability""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_theistic_probability):

&gt;1. Strong theist. 100 per cent probability of God. In the words of C.G. Jung: ""I do not believe, I know.""
2. De facto theist. Very high probability but short of 100 per cent. ""I don't know for certain, but I strongly believe in God and live my life on the assumption that he is there.""
3. Leaning towards theism. Higher than 50 per cent but not very high. ""I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God.""
4. Completely impartial. Exactly 50 per cent. ""God's existence and non-existence are exactly equiprobable.""
5. Leaning towards Agnosticism. Lower than 50 per cent but not very low. ""I do not know whether God exists but I'm inclined to be skeptical.""
6. De facto atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. ""I don't know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.""
7. Strong atheist. ""I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one.""

What I was originally asking about was arguments from those who self-identify as a 7 on this scale -- people who are absolutely certain that gods do not exist. Most of the replies I have gotten from self-identifying ""strong-atheists"" have actually been arguments for a 6 on this scale.

[Introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xn11k/would_rdebateanatheist_be_up_for_a_book_review/)

[Chapter 1: *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xsm46/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

Sorry about the delay, the next chapter should be much quicker.

**Chapter 2 - How Could a Good God Allow Suffering?**

&gt;Just because you can't see or imagine a good reason why God might allow something to happen doesn't mean there can't be one.  Again we see lurking within supposedly hard-nosed skepticism an enormous faith in one's own cognitive faculties.

I am guessing this argument will come up in every chapter.  He did bring this up in the introduction but it wasn't apparent to me that this was going to be his main focus of the book.   'Your beliefs are just as shitty as mine,' seem to be his ace in the hole.   

This chapter made it blatantly obvious that Keller's epistimology is so different than mine its no suprise we came to different conclusions.  Keller actually uses a variation of Russell's teapot to argue FOR God and the universe having a meaning.

&gt;The fallacy at the heart of this argument has been illustrated by the ""no-see-ums""... of Plantinga.  If you look into your tent for a ""no-see-um""  and you don't see any, it is not reasonable to assume they aren't there.  Because after all, no one can see 'em.

The closest he gets to arguing his case  boils down to an argument from ignorance.  

&gt;With time and perspective most of us can see good reasons for at least *some* of the tragedy and pain that occurs in life.  Why couldn't it be possible that, from God's vantage point, there are good reasons for all of them.

What becomes blatantly obvious in this chapter is that Keller does not understand the atheists position (at least the arguments I see most often presented) and its not just Keller.  

&gt;C.S. Lewis described how he had originally rejected the idea of God because of the cruelty of life.  Then he came to realize that evil was even more problematic for new atheism.

Keller goes on to quote Lewis

&gt;*My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust.  But how had I got this idea of ""just"" and ""unjust""? . . . What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? . . . Of course I could have given up my idea of justive by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own.  But if I did that, then my argument against God collapsed too---for the argument depeneded on saying that the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my private fancies. . . . Consequently atheism turns out to be too simple.*

This to me says it all.  Even as an atheist Lewis couldn't let go of the idea that there was some objective meaning to life.  He basically states that for atheism to be true then purpose must be subjective... but I mean who believes that, that would just be silly so lets ignore that I brought it up.  Keller refers to Lewis'  acutal (not accidental) argument against God as 'modern' but dependent on objective truth.   Why refute an actual atheist when a strawman is so much easier? 

Keller continues to emphasize that an objective moral standard must be established for us to label things bad and good but when you succeed in doing so you have demonstrated God.  He tells you how you must frame the argument so that he ends up being correct.   Although he never really makes it all that clear, he just keeps asserting that it is so.

In honesty Keller concludes this line of reasoning with 

&gt;It is at least as big a problem for nonbelief in God as for belief. 

But only a specific type of nonbelief that seemed to impress a younger C.S. Lewis.   I am curious what Keller would do with a Sam Harris style morality, but it was jaw dropping that Keller didn't even want to admit that there might be an atheist who thinks things are subjective.  

Keller admits he doesn't have all the answers

&gt;Christianity does not provide the reason for each experience of pain, it provides deep resources for actually facing suffering with hope and courage rather than bitterness and despair.

Even if that hope is false.  Keller makes this argument for the next four pages but then concludes with a statement that is nothing more than special pleading.

***

I go back and forth, you guys. I would like to be an atheist. I'm not being facetious or misleading, I just need some final pushes, I think. Or clarification. Here are my thoughts, just in order of how they came up. 

I don't subscribe to any religion. I was raised...in a confusing way. My father and mother, in the same household, were Muslim/sinner and Muslim/Christian/Agnostic/Muslim/Christian/JustBeAGoodPersonBecauseIDon'tKnow, respectively (mom changed her mind a lot). I don't believe there is a man in the sky judging me, I don't believe in cherry-picking the parts of a religion I like &amp; disregarding the rest, I don't believe in Hell or the Devil or any of that mythical drivel.

But.

I cannot shake that I literally cannot and do not and will not ever know what will happen to ""me"" when I die unless I die and find that something happens. I know, I know, I am the sum of my parts--a brain with neurons firing and a heart that beats until it doesn't and an anus that will let loose and expel my waste when I go. I get that. Sort of. Maybe my issue comes from a physical detachment. I'm sure we've all felt that. You know, when you look around and think, ""what if none of this is actually here and it's all in my head?"" It's more a philosophical question than anything, at its core: can we really ""know"" anything? We can have evidence that piles, we can have evidence that what we see and touch and feel is real, but can we ever know this isn't the matrix? You know what I mean? 

I AM NOT A SCIENTIST. I AM NOT GOOD IN SCIENCE CLASSES AND I HAVE A HARD TIME WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND COMPLEX SCIENTIFIC IDEAS. BUT. I appreciate it, of course!! I ""believe"" in it (for lack of a better word)! I would never deny the beauty in its commitment to seeking truth, or in the effects of the wonders already discovered by scientists on the world around me--whether that world is real or not. I love watching documentaries about how the universe formed, and I'm totally with it for billions of years (assuming the world is real from here on lol) until it gets to the beginning. I'm not saying that the theory of the big bang is stupid, or that the possibility of multiple universes isn't real. But it always bugs me that I can't go back to the very beginning for sure in my head. That even if either of those answers is the one, how is that possible? Eventually, we are supposed to accept that there was at one point ""nothing"" and I feel like that is a nearly impossible concept to wrap your head around. How could there ever have been a single point in nothing? And where did the single point come from? And what was the nothing? Where is the nothing? What is nothing? I think that's called infinite regress? Not sure. Fix it for me.

How do I get over these things? Can you help me understand? I feel like not understanding these (possibly basic?) concepts has kept me from accepting that there is no god. 

In my head, the closest I can articulate, is that God is something we are all connected to (and by!), all come from and all return to. Something eternal and universal. That's it. I don't see this as a negative thing. I even think of the universe as ""God"" sometimes as it is infinite, we all come from it, are connected by it, and return to it in some other form of energy. And if we are a part of this universe, if we are a part of ""god,"" eventually, when we learn enough about the universe, we can manipulate it too &amp; become even more connected to each other and to it in our understanding. 

Unless, of course, none of it is real. Ha...ha...heh. :(

Am I already an atheist? Do we take issue with my definition of God? Is the universe my god? I find a lot of comfort in my previous definition concerning connection and infinity. Am I just scared to let go of the term? 

Sorry if this is jumbled and confusing. Sorry if this is plain stupid. I often feel that I am stupid. Help me be less stupid. Please don't call me stupid.

In my previous email I made three objections to morality in the bible, and this is his response. I can think of a few things that I could say, but I would much rather give a more thought out, researched answer if I could. So, could you help me tackle these refutations? I apologize for the long read. 

Objection #1: “So it seems like objective right and wrong exists, and God is the perfect embodiment of everything good, or right. But with this view, right and wrong is independent of God. If you say it stems from his nature, then morality exists without God, and he is simply recognizing this and passing it along to us.”

I think that you’ve committed some errors in logic. First, you put words in my mouth (a straw-man argument) by claiming I said, “God is the perfect embodiment of everything good.” I would not describe God this way. God does not “have” goodness. God “is” goodness. God is the very essence of good. Goodness and God cannot be separated. Thus, Jesus said, “No one IS good except God alone” (Mark 10:18, Luke 18:19). When we participate in goodness we are acting in communion with God. Peter refers to that as “participating in the divine nature” (2 Peter 1:3-7). Thus, human goodness is found in our ability to reflect the divine image. The good in humanity come from God in that it reflects God’s image. James, for example, says, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change”(Jas 1:17). When I recognize my own reflection in a mirror, I am not recognizing something external from me. I am simply recognizing my own image. In the same way, when God “sees” good in humanity his sees a reflection of His own nature. That’s why the Bible uses the metaphor of being created in God’s image. 

Second, you also commit a non sequitur (a conclusion which does not follow from the argument) when you say, “If [morality/goodness] stems from his nature, then morality exists without God, and he is simply recognizing this and passing it along to us.” In fact the metaphor you used “stems from” contradicts your own statement. If something “stems from” something it remains vitally connected to it. For example, leaves on tree “stem from” the branches that in turn stem from the trunk that in turn stem from the roots. So, are the leaves somehow now independent of the tree? That’s absurd. The leaves are in fact vitally connected to the tree. They participate in the nature or the “tree-ness” of the tree as long as they remain connected to the tree. If they are cut off from that vital connection they die and soon cease to exist as parts of a tree. They loose all of their “tree-ness” and become soil. Again, this is similar to verse mentioned above about humans “participating in the divine nature.” Paul is quoted as saying, “In him we live and move and have our being” (Acts 17:28). Thus, to be alive and good is to be “in God.” In fact, this is how being a follower Jesus is most often described in the New Testament; we are “in Christ.” Thus, it does not follow necessarily that just because something “stems from” something that they must be things independent of each other. Goodness can in fact “stem from” God and yet remain vitally connected to the very nature or essence of God. 

Objection #2 “There are also several instances in the bible where God acts murderously or commands, what most people today would consider to be, immoral behavior. It's interesting that you quote Gen. 9:6, which you claim gives us the reason that murder is wrong. Yet how do you explain Leviticus 20:9, which states that children shall be put to death for cursing their parents? Or even more abhorrent is Isaiah 13:15, which mandates that ""Their little children will be dashed to death right before their eyes"", and ""Their homes will be sacked and their wives raped by the attacking hordes. For I will stir up the Medes against Babylon, and no amount of silver or gold will buy them off. The attacking armies will shoot down the young people with arrows. They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for the children."" This is appalling, and has absolutely no moral justification. Any God who would set such laws is surely not a just and good god.

I really think a course in basic logic would do you well, my friend. As you navigate through your own beliefs, those of your family, friends and professors it would do you well to have some good tools for evaluating what people think. 

First, your objection is a self-contradiction. You object to there being an objective morality then you objectively present a moral objection to the ethics and God of the Old Testament. On the one hand you have claimed that there is no such thing as “objective” morality. Yet, in the same breath you say that what God commands and does in the Old Testament is “appalling and has absolutely no moral justification” and that such a God is “surely not a just and good god.” Really now? “Absolutely?” “Surely?” You can’t have your cake and eat it too. You can’t object to objective morally then go on to make objective moral pronouncements like “this is absolutely appalling” and this “has absolutely no moral justification.” You have no rational basis by which to judge neither the Old Testament commands nor God’s actions because you threw out the baby with the bath water. In logic, this is called self-contradiction. It’s similar to the nonsensical statement of the relativist, “There is no absolute truth.” It is nonsensical because it makes an absolute truth claim that there is no absolute truth. Another example is one that extreme skeptics often make, “We can’t know anything.” If we can’t know anything, then how could we know that we can’t know anything? 

Second, you could have given me some better examples to make the point I think that you are trying to make. You mentioned Isaiah 13. The entire book of Isaiah is apocalyptic poetry. Poetry is full of metaphor and overstatement. It is never taken literally. What poetry does is to express strong emotions through images created by words. One of the greatest English poets, William Wordsworth, said, “good poetry is the spontaneous overflow of powerful emotions” (Preface to Lyrical Ballads). So, the simple answer to Isaiah 13 simply, “It’s poetry dude! Don’t take it literally.” This actually clears up a number of the supposedly “problematic” passages in the Old Testament though it doesn’t explain off all of the violent commands of the Old Testament. But, I think I get your point. 

You could have given me a better example such as God’s commands to Israel (through Joshua) to conquer Canaan. “When the Lord your God brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations –the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites, seven nations larger and stronger than you– and when the Lord your God has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them, then you must destroy them totally. Make no treaty with them, and show them no mercy” (Deut. 7). Now, there’s a real moral conundrum for you. This is definitely not poetic. Is God commanding a Jihad? It sure sounds like it to the modern reader. To understand the problem of violence in the Old Testament we’re need to start with some foundational thinking and go one-step at a time. 

(1)	What is right or wrong for God isn’t necessarily the same as what is right or wrong for humans. For example (within a theist framework), it is right for humans to worship God because God is the object of worship. But, we wouldn’t say that God also has to worship himself. We may object to this but if we applied it to humans, we can see that in many cases we do this as humans. Let’s say that I own a really nice Harley Davidson motorcycle and you want to use it. It would be wrong for you walk into my house, take my keys and ride off on my bike without any permission. Now let’s say that I want to use my bike. Would it be wrong for me to walk into my house, take my keys and ride off on my bike without any permission? Of course not. But, why? Because I own the bike. I am under no obligation to ask anyone’s permission to use what rightfully belongs to me. 
(2)	Now, let look at Gen 9:6 again. This verse gives a reason why it if wrong for a “man” to take the life of another “man.” It describes what is right or wrong for humans to do, not God. I don’t have the right to take the life of another human being because I am not the Creator of that life and because there is intrinsic value in that life. But, that doesn’t mean that it is wrong for God to take a human life. This is what Job realize after the loss of his entire family, “Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD” (Job 1:21). If God really does exist and makes the decision to give life, then it logically follows that He alone can rightfully decide when to take life back again. We often accuse doctors of “playing God” when they act in questionable ways to terminate the life of a patient. You may not like the idea that God alone has the right to determine when to take a human life, but it doesn’t make the idea irrational or arbitrary. 
(3)	When God issues a command plague or death it is always connected to the just punishment of evil, which was often some severe perversion of justice. The plagues against Egypt were sent in response to 400 years of brutal slavery and oppression. Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed not because of their sexual perversions (contrary to fundamentalist Christian beliefs), but because they perverted justice and oppressed the poor. Ezekiel declared, “this was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy” (Eze 16:49). Yikes!!! Sounds like America: proud, fat, rich and doesn’t give a shit about the poor. When a culture cares more about getting a cheaper iPad and doesn’t care about the dangerous working conditions poor factory worker in China assembling those iPads it’s is testing God’s patience. 
(4)	Borrowing from C.S. Lewis’ description of Aslan can thus say that God is good, but He is not tame or safe. So, if you’re going to muck around with injustice, you’re going to be grabbing a lion by its tale. This idea should be consoling though. The Old Testament God (which is that same God of the New Testament by the way) will punish injustice. This gives hope to everyone suffering under oppressive governments and dictators. God is keeping score on injustice and will one day dish out justice (that what all that imagery in Revelation is all about). 
(5)	So, now we have to ask ourselves, who were these groups of people God commanded Israel to destroy. Is it possible that an entire nation of people could be so evil as to warrant divine destruction? Well, we need to understand that a “nation” in the ancient world was not the same as a nation in the modern world. We aren’t talking about millions or even billions of people like when we talk about the Chinese or Indians. Ancient nations were numbered in the thousands and some were not much bigger than what we would call a tribe today. So, it’s not like we are saying that 3.8 billion people were so evil that they deserved to die. There weren’t even 3.8 billion people on the planet in the ancient world. But, it is possible for ancient-world-size groups of people to become utterly vicious and evil. Today we call them Al-Qaeda. If you study ancient near eastern history, as I have, you will soon realize that these groups of people that God was talking about were the ancient world equivalents of Al-Qaeda, but much worse. Common practices in these nations included: bestiality, adult-child sex, regular child sacrifice (not the once a year stuff of the Incas), sex slavery, labor slavery and so on (again I’m not making this stuff up). What would be your response to a large group of people who practiced all of the things I mentioned above? The reality is that the ancient world was a much more brutal world than our sanitized modern world. Sure we’ve got our share of violence and war in the modern world, but there are very few nations today out there screwing their sheep and skinning their kids. 
(6)	What if God killed a minority of innocent people as he carried out his wrath on the majority who deserved it? Well, the Old Testament answers this question in several stories where God’s wrath is dished out. In the Exodus account, God allows 400 years to go by before dishing out his plagues. This tells us that God is patient even with the worst people. Both Joel and Jonah tell us, “God is slow to anger.” Even the plagues begin small and become worse and worse. The Egyptian could also be spared if they repented and did what the Hebrews did during the Passover meal and many were spared. In fact, we read that when the Hebrews finally left Egypt, “a mixed multitude also went up with them” (Ex. 12:38). So, there were Egyptians who did repent were spared by God. The same was true of Rahab the prostitute. God spared her too. Prior to the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, we find Abraham haggling with God to spare the cities. Abraham posed this very question to God, “Will you indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked?”(Ge 18:23) He asked if God would spare the city on behalf of 50 righteous people. God responded that He would in fact spare the city if there were 50 righteous people in it. Abraham bargained God all the way down to 10 people and God finally said, “For the sake of ten I will not destroy it.” But, there weren’t even 10 innocent people in the two cities. But, there were less than 10 people (Lot and his family). God warned them and gave them time to escape the destruction, so in the end the city was destroyed while at the same time all who were innocent were spared. 
(7)	Thus, we arrive at the principle that God never punishes, accidentally punishes or even kills innocent people as collateral damage. 
(8)	For the sake of argument let’s just say that annihilation of these people was somehow justified. Still, how could anyone follow through on such a command? And, how would we have confidence that that person is hearing from God and not his own imagination or a demon. For starters, I’ll state the obvious. Such a person would have to be damn sure it’s God talking. Let’s take Joshua since he was given the largest such command in the Old Testament (the conquest of Canaan). Who was Joshua? He began his life as a Hebrew slave in Egypt. He was an eyewitness to the miraculous plagues against Egypt during the Exodus. Moses who spoke face to face with God groomed him. He physically followed God, who appeared as a pillar of cloud by day and fire by night. He was the only other person allowed into the tent of meeting with Moses as Moses met with God. So, I think of anyone in the Old Testament, Joshua would qualify as someone who is damn sure when God is talking. 

Objection #3 Finally, I object to the notion of the intrinsic value of man on the basis our species' evolution. When, in the span of history, was the exact moment that we became like God? Was it when we were still single celled organisms, or perhaps when we developed limbs? Was it when we shifted from being quadrupedal to bipedal? Or was it when we evolved from our most recent evolutionary ancestor? It doesn't make sense that, if we were truly created in God's image, we would have evolved at all. 

Well this one is easy. I’m not an evolutionist. So, the simple answer is that we were created in God’s image when God created the first man. But, let me point out on more logical error you are making here. It’s called a red herring. A red herring is a smelly old fish that criminals would throw one direction and run the other direction in order to throw off the scents of the pursuing police hounds. This discussion is not about the merits or faults of evolution. It’s about the existence of objective morality in relation to the existence of God. To bring up evolution as an objection to my points is to commit a red herring.

Hopefully this is a better forum for this kind of thing and I can make my point without pissing anyone off

So it is my contention that eating meat is a position you could not possibly arrive at with a developed sense of morality *unless* you had some extremely credible moral authority tell you that it was ok to do it. Since atheists do not have a credible moral authority, it is a corollary of my position that an atheist with meat-eating tendencies will experience cognitive dissonance he or she cannot overcome, because it relies on a base belief in God

Moving quickly through the first part of the argument, the religious have a holy book where God tells them its ok to eat meat. The Islamic and Judaic holy books say there are some kinds of meat it is not ok to eat, but they are broadly pro-meat. The messianic figures in these books all eat meat, and Jesus even encourages his followers to eat meat with him. If you believe your holy book is literally the words and beliefs of your God, then I can see how you would arrive at a belief that eating meat was fine.

However, atheists such as ourselves don't have that luxury. I'll sketch (and please bare in mind this is a very bare-bones sketch) two reasons why I think an atheist could not possibly arrive at a meat eating position were it not for the fact that they live in predominantly religious culture.

1. Argument from food security

A vegetarian diet is about ten times more energy efficient than the same number of calories taken as meat. That is to say, if the entire world were vegetarian, there would be ten times more food in it without doing very much work at all. There are a lot of starving people in the world; for the sake of the West's giving up meat, those people could be in a position where they are no longer starving

If you prefer a more concrete example, since becoming a vegetarian, I save about $2-3 a day on food. Over a year, I have saved about $900 over a meat-eater. If everyone in the US did this, then donated that money to charity it would come out at about $300 billion

Peter Singer proposed the 'Singer Principle' - if you can sacrifice something of moral importance X to ensure a good moral outcome Y, and X&lt;Y, you are obliged to do it. The religious don't mind about people dying of starvation if they go to heaven, so it might be ok for them to eat meat. But since atheists know that there is no heaven, we are condemning those starving to a pretty nasty death for the sake of enjoying our meals slightly more

2. Argument from animal rights

It is pretty well accepted that animals are capable of feeling things like pain and slightly less well accepted, but still the scientific consensus, that they are capable of forming attachments, feeling intentional states and feeling emotions like 'fear' and 'surprise' (even if they feel those emotions to a lesser degree and with a lesser degree of rationality to humans). It is pretty well accepted among atheists that the humans came to be through a process of iterative evolution that does not make us significantly morally different to most animals. The religious deny this, of course, but that's why we mock them

Raising an animal for the sole purpose of killing it seems wrong if we accept there are reasons we don't kill humans for food (even those humans not capable of reasoning such as infants or the infirm elderly). I know all atheists love to eat babies, but we all feel a little bit guilty about it I mean. The reason it seems wrong to me is that we accept animals are qualitatively similar to humans because they have evolved that way (so have we, for that matter) and we value things like 'agency' and 'happiness'

*Some atheists on r/atheism told me they* would *eat a human if it wasn't stigmatized against - perhaps this argument wouldn't convince them as much as it convinces me*

So with that in mind, why are many atheists also meat-eaters? Do you agree that it is a position of cognative dissonance for many atheists? Do you believe the 'bolt holes' (denying animals feel pain etc) smack of 'God of the gaps' explanations we all hate so very much?

1325615079.0,28,self.DebateAnAtheist,o1cfl,Atheism is the most prudent choice: A twist on Pascal's Wager,shiftysquid,40,12,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/o1cfl/atheism_is_the_most_prudent_choice_a_twist_on/,"OK, let me start out by stating that I'm an agnostic atheist who does not think honest belief is a choice at all. You should only believe something that can be adequately demonstrated from the available evidence to be likely true (with a few insignificant, minor exceptions, but you get my point). 

But as I've debated with Christians (a former one, myself), Muslims and creationists over the years, I've often been sideswiped with Pascal's Wager, a long-debunked argument with which I'm sure most of you are familiar. If you don't know what Pascal's Wager states, here's the gist of it, and the page from [the Wikiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager): If God exists, and you choose to believe, you gain eternal life in heaven; if God exists and you choose to disbelieve, you suffer eternal torture. If God doesn't exist and you choose to believe, you lose/gain nothing; if God doesn't exist and you choose not to believe, you lose/gain nothing. So choose to believe, because you stand to gain everything and lose nothing.

In thinking about this recently, though, it's occurred to me that, even if we grant the premises that one can honestly choose what they believe and that there is, in fact, a God, atheism is actually the most prudent choice in this situation (not that I think I'm the first one to think of this, to be clear).

To explain, I think most of us would agree that Pascal's Wager is an appeal to consequences. It's also a false dichotomy. Humans have made up thousands of gods, so it's not just ""Believe in my god, or be an atheist."" It's ""Believe in my god, or that god, or that god, or that god, etc., etc., or be an atheist,"" more or less. Thus, there are actually thousands of choices here. We must also recognize that, if we were to grant that one or more of them exists, we can't know for certain what any of their intentions or standards for getting into their ""heaven"" are, if they even have one. 

What we can say is that it's entirely plausible that the god(s) who does exist would be more irritated at you worshiping a different god than it would if you don't worship any god at all. After all, most dictators will accept ambivalence far more easily than they will outright traitorship. It's difficult to imagine this god(s) being *more* angry at atheists than those who worship the wrong god(s). And with so many gods to choose from, the odds are pretty lousy that you'll choose the correct one or ones. Also, it's not unreasonable to suggest that any god who would create us with the ability for reason and complex thinking would want to reward us for using our brain to the extent we could, not simply choosing a god to believe in in order to hedge our bets.

Thus, the prudent choice is to not choose one at all, if we grant these premises. If you choose the wrong god, the correct ones may punish you forever. If you choose the right god, you gain eternal life. If you choose no god, the correct god may punish you forever, or may reward you for using the mind it gave you to think for yourself and not simply pick a god to believe in.

**tl;dr** In Pascal's Wager, atheism is actually the prudent choice because there are thousands of gods to choose from, and we can't know their will if they exist.

I have been seeing a lot of pro-atheism posts making their way to the front page of Reddit and have been impressed by the size of the atheist community.  Some (but by no means all) of these posts seem anti-religion.  I am wondering whether my religious views seem unreasonable.

I am a Catholic by faith although I might be called a cafeteria Catholic since there are parts of my faith that I have a hard time believing.  I (perhaps incorrectly) chalk this up to a skepticism that the Catholic Church (which insists that God is mysterious and at the same time insists that they can interpret what is mysterious) is a bit suspect as a claim.  Either he is knowable (in which case there would be NO debate) or he is mysterious (in which case we are just making the best possible guess that we can under the circumstances).

I am personally offended when others use God to justify war, hatred, discrimination, prejudice, and the like.  While I personally believe abortion is morally wrong, I do not favor a law banning it.  Since it is a moral issue, I have no problem with individuals who choose to do so (and I am not one of those who do this) spending time attempting to convince others of the correctness of their position.  However, when they try to intimidate others, that is going far over a civil line.  On to my beliefs (I am sure I am leaving something out but this is what I have at this moment):

I believe the following:

1. God exists.

2. We cannot fully comprehend God.

3. God is merciful.

4. The bible is a religious book.

5. The Koran is also a religious book.

6. There are many other religious books and all hold truth for those who believe.  Those who forget that we can't hope to comprehend something that exists for us because of faith and insist that it is all literally true or hold one passage to justify an action that clearly goes against the grain of what the religion claims to be the truth are not really thinking this out.

7. There are many paths to God.  Claims that your path is correct and some other path is wrong is not only disrespectful but contains the seeds of hubris that frighten many sane individuals.  Saying we must rely on faith and then saying your faith is ""correct"" and my faith is ""wrong"" is not only intolerant but misguided (at best).

8. Heaven is different for each person and is reserved for those who practice their faith.  Catholics who practice their faith get heaven (and purgatory for those that feel they deserve it since they believe in it), Buddhists get nirvana, and so on.

9. Hell, according to my (limited) understanding of the bible and fitting with my concept of a loving God is the absence of God.  Therefore, in my mind, Hitler is not burning in an eternal fire.  He simply ceased to exist.  (I would however like to imagine that God may let the truly evil a split second understanding of what they are missing but that is borne more out of my sense of fairness and less from what I understand a loving God to be like.)

10. Those who choose not to believe will NOT be punished by a vengeful God.  Instead, they will have their wish fulfilled (nothing after death - no heaven but certainly no hell).

11. If you choose to believe in God and choose a path to him/her/it, you must be consistent in your beliefs to gain access to heaven.  That means that if your religious views require you to go to church or to avoid a certain food, you have to do these things.  If you don't like the path you are on, you are free to choose another but you can't have it both ways.  Now if you sincerely in your heart believe that a particular teaching is wacky but the religion is correct overall, you are not being punished for that.  However, ignoring tenets of faith because they are inconvenient is not ok.

11A. This means that saying you are a Christian, going on about ""what would Jesus do"" to justify things you agree with on a personal level and then ignoring Jesus when it is less convenient is not only not cool, but doesn't help you get the afterlife you claim is your deserved reward.

11B. An example of this would be a Catholic going nuts when they hear that abortion is not illegal, claiming God wants abortion to be outlawed, citing the Church's views on it as their rationale and then turning around and ignoring the Church's views on issues like treatment of the poor (pro-welfare), immigration (pro-immigration), and the like.

12. All religious books (including the bible) are at best, attempts to better understand God.  Literal interpretations are not only inadvisable, but almost always false.  For example, Genesis suggests that God played some role in the creation of the world, but to think it happened exactly as portrayed (especially since there are two creation stories in Genesis that contradict each other) is at best, naive.

13. It is entirely possible to be a nice person without invoking God.  God is not a necessary precondition for a functioning society.  For me though, God is a necessary part of my life and I am happier for it.


I do not want to force my beliefs on others.  I do know that my belief in God gives me strength when facing adversities, comfort when I am scared, and happiness that I have someone/something to thank for all of the blessings that have been bestowed on me.  I sincerely hope that others who do not believe have their own source of strength.

Their beliefs are as follows:

* belief in Jesus as a personal guide and savior

* belief in Jesus leads to an eternity in heaven

* prayer leads us to unlock God's plan which could otherwise not be unlocked without prayer

* belief in Jesus strengthened through ""answered"" prayers

At this point, they are already convinced that Jesus is real and talks to them. Any standard argument is shot down with ""no, Jesus talks to me and led me to the truth"". ""I know Jesus is real because he speaks to me"".

They told me that if I only tried praying to Jesus that I would see that he is real. So I'll debate you as if I am my friend: ""You're just scared to pray to God because it will prove you're wrong"".

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments!

Some of the best responses so far and other things the comments have made think about:

* The claim that prayer will prove the existence of a deity is **unfalsifiable**. Falsifiability is required before any claim is worth investigating.

* How can one distinguish between true divine contact and a mental disorder?

* What is the limit for how much a person's actions can be justified by ""God told me to do it""?

* Multiple people pray to Jesus and get different, inconsistent results. Shouldn't God have a consisten plan for the world?

* If prayer were an effective means of proving that God exists than how does one explain the increasing number of ex-Christians?

* By definition, belief in religious experiences is required before one can have a religious experience.

* If God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, he would know exactly what he needed to do to convince me that he is real and he would want to do it.

* If God's plan is ""unlocked"" through prayer, does **not** praying alter God's plan?

1372427421.0,24,self.DebateAnAtheist,1h8x05,I don't think the problem of evil is always a good argument to use.,new_atheist,36,12,196,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1h8x05/i_dont_think_the_problem_of_evil_is_always_a_good/,"In debates with theists, I want to make sure that the arguments I am using are honest, factually accurate, and fair.  I don't want to offer up an argument that has potential holes in it, and fail to acknowledge those weaknesses.

The problem of evil is a good example of this.  I think it has potential problems that I think need to be addressed before we can consider it a useful and powerful argument against particular god concepts.

Let me start by saying that I **do** think it has merit against the classic Christian God.  But, only because that particular god concept comes packaged with a lot of other theological claims which, together with the problem of evil, demonstrate that such a being probably doesn't exist.  More on that later.

First, let's begin by stating the problem of evil.

P1) An all-loving god would prevent evil.  
P2) An all-powerful god could prevent evil.  
P3) But, evil exists.  
C)  Therefore, an all-powerful and all-loving god does not exist.  

Premise 1 and 2 are the real items at issue.  There are many responses to both of these.  Would god prevent evil?  Could he prevent evil?  Let's deal with the ""would he"" first.

You have all heard the theistic rebuttals to this.  Freewill!  God has a master plan!  He works in mysterious ways!  All of these are an attempt to ""explain"" why god would not want to prevent evil, even if he could.  In the past, my go-to response for all of these things has been:

&gt;If the god in question is truly all-powerful, then he could still accomplish all of those things (i.e. freewill, a master plan, etc.), and still not require that evil exist.  If he can do absolutely anything then he should be able to do this.

&gt;It makes no sense to say he doesn't want to prevent evil because these other things will be compromised if he has the power to stop evil and also not allow these things to be compromised.  If he has such power, then all evil and suffering becomes pointless by definition.

At that point, it really becomes an issue of whether or not god **could** prevent evil.  Which brings us to premise 2.  Could he?

The definition of omnipotence my counter argument above somewhat relies on is ""all-power with absolutely no limitations.""  However, it is important to note that many theists and apologists don't use this definition.  They do put a caveat on ""all-powerful.""  They say that omnipotence is ""all power that is logically possible.""

You might ask ""Why should we accept this definition?""  But, it is my contention that, for the point of the argument, we **must** accept this caveat.  After all, if you are using a logical argument (i.e. the problem of evil) to counter their god claim, it would be pointless to use it against a god concept that is not limited by the rules of logic.  If he can do anything, including things that aren't logically possible, then the problem of evil is rendered useless against such a concept.

So, let's accept the caveat that god has all power that is logically possible.  This may be the ""out"" for the theist.  It's possible that the evil that exists is all of the evil that the god was incapable of stopping due to logical contradictions.  Can you have ""A"" but not ""B"" if ""B"" is necessary for ""A"" to exist?

If we claim, like I did above, that god could have all of the same results (i.e. freewill, master plan, etc.) and still not require evil to exist, then this puts the burden of proof on us to demonstrate that such a thing is logically possible.  And, I have no real way of demonstrating that.

Bear in mind, this doesn't provide any evidence in support of the god concept being argued against.  But, unless that burden of proof can be met, it is a weakness in the problem of evil argument.

As I said before, I do think the problem of evil still applies to the classic Christian conception of God, because I can use their established theology to show logical incoherence in their claims.  The problem of Heaven shows (at least conceptually) that, according to their theology, freewill can exist while evil doesn't.  And, that god, being omniscient would know how his master plan would turn out anyway.  So, he could simply skip all of that and only create the people who would choose to worship him (had they been subjected to his rat maze experiment) in Heaven, free of suffering.

It's just that when it comes to other god concepts which don't carry this theological baggage with them, that I think the problem of evil runs into...well...a problem.  But, if I have gone wrong in my train of thought, please point it out.  As I said in the beginning, I want to make sure that my arguments pass muster.

",BeTheOtherGuy,91,64,255,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/17jwj7/alright_atheists_convince_me/,"Been a casual redditor, but just signed in for the first time because all these /r/atheism posts are legitimately starting to bother me. I'm an objectivist Christian whose faith is grounded in a rational decision, rather than subjective belief or transient emotion. I recently received an engineering degree while graduating in the top 1% of my class from a large state University. I'm presently in law school.

I don't want to argue don't about a literal interpretation of the Bible. The phrase ""It's a Metaphor"" can be applied to many of the stories inside of it, and they're no different than my little cousin trying to describe an ambulance to me as a fast white bus with a loud horn and flashing lights. The story is right in the speaker's mind, and with enough context in the listener's as well. What I will defend until I die is my response to the choice facing each of us, in accepting the command given by Jesus Christ to love each other the way Jesus loves us. If we act that way and accept salvation when it is presented to us, I believe we all will go to heaven.

What so many atheists form their anti-religious beliefs on is problems within the church - pedo bishops, anti-gay movement, killing people for saying the earth revolves around the Sun, etc. Problems such as these have been around since the earliest days of the church (see the bulk of the New Testament, when Paul writes the churches and points out a number of their issues, often involving church leaders who are telling a different version of the Gospel). What people forget is that Christians aren't supposed to develop their beliefs and practices from the church. They are told to believe and follow Christ.

Everything about his life made the incoherent old Jewish prophecies make sense. The improbable circumstances surrounding his birth reveal why Jesus deserves our attention. What did Jesus have that we don't? The right environment; the right circumstances. He also had an unwavering devotion to a life of virtue. Can anyone actually criticize his life or actions?

He saw his purpose and lived accordingly - to serve as a role model for every human on Earth. He only commanded us to do one thing, not Ten things, not any part of Leviticus or Deuteronomy, but just to love each other with a perfect love. He also told us that no matter how many mistakes, as long as we seek salvation through him then irrational fear doesn't need to exist. The key isn't to do enough good deeds to get to heaven. It's to give it your best shot and not give up when you fail.

So, distinguished from the Church, I believe in an objective reality. I also believe there are elements to that reality beyond our perception. I believe God operates somewhere outside of that perceptible reality, but that the existence of creation necessitates a Creator. I believe that our recognition of beauty in such arbitrary things as a sunset or waves on a beach is evidence of our relation to that Creator, and despite our best efforts, that Creator will always be in control - the chemicals of emotion and circuitry of intelligence that comprise our bodies can only give fleeting glimpses of whatever force created every star in the sky. I believe that the Creator is continually being revealed, but that revelation requires an act of will on our part, a recognition of something larger than ourselves. The rational response to this recognition is an alteration of our behavior and our attitude. To me that's enlightenment, which is synonymous with salvation.

I've studied various philosophies to keep myself honest while I gained a higher education, keeping an open mind as to religions because anything else was an act of irrational fear. What happens after death is something no one can tell me with certainty, and asserting that the answer is ""nothing"" is as close-minded as applying a rule written thousands of years ago to particular and unique circumstances today. Although its inclusion in the Bible means the church thinks the rule is helpful guidance, the rational mind sees that the social structures surrounding the rule have changed. Therefore rigid adherence to something that stands in opposition to the one command we have been given can't be right. Jesus was not on the side of organized religion - that's what nobody seems to get these days.

Consider the following:
Imagine that you are walking past a shallow pond. In this pond there is a child that is drowning. If you keep walking past, the child will likely drown. You can save the child with virtually no risk to yourself. However, you are wearing an expensive pair of pants that you just bought the day before, and if you go into the pond you are going to have to pay $30 to get your pants dry cleaned. Should you save the child? If you don't save the child, and continue walking past, have you done something morally wrong?

Now, let's say that you do believe that someone that walks past is morally wrong. What about if you got a letter from a charity asking for a donation for $30 which will be used to save a child in Africa's life, and you knew beyond any doubt that donating the $30 would result in saving a child that would likely die without your donation. Assuming that you are living a comfortable life (i.e. you aren't poor), should you donate the money? If you don't donate the money, have you done something morally wrong?

Supporting equal rights is different than supporting traditional heterosexual marriage.. Heterosexual marriage is already established and not going anywhere. Whereas same sex marriage is exceedingly rare in the US, there are more states in which one can marry a family member than another person of the same sex. 

I am more than happy to tolerate other's views so long as they don't seek to impose their belief structure on others through government or law. As such if a person disagrees with gay marriage but also wouldn't vote to limit a persons ability to do it I am fine with this. If you don't agree with gay marriage don't get one, it's that simple. Same goes for abortion. I like liberty, a principle this country was founded upon. 

I think if the CEO left his degree of involvement in this issue to a simple statement the reaction from the public would be different. However they chose invest millions of dollars into groups seeking to limit the rights of others.

I haven't heard a single cogent argument against equal marriage rights. Christian dogma is not sufficient reason to limit this right on a national level. 

I apologize if I come off as rude, I admit I have little patience when it comes to this topic.



_____________________________________________

HIM

1. Marriage by definition is one man and one woman. It has never been 2 people of the same sex. so you have to redefine marriage in order to legalize it. 

2. No-one is not allowed to marry. You simply adhere to what a marriage is. 

3. If 2 men or women marry then we should also allow polygamy and people can marry animals as well. You have to have limits of some kind. Per the naturalistic worldview we are just animals anyway so any animal can marry any animal right?

4. All social studies have demonstrated that the ideal environment for children is with a married Mom and dad. The latest study shows all of the problems of children raised by gay couples done by a prof at the u of Texas. The press didn't like his results even though it was the largest sample ever studied. There is a current investigation into his study...only because of hIs results...so much for science. Just because heterosexuals aren't doing things right doesn't make gay marriage a good idea either.

5. Common sense. It is amazing to me that few acknowledge the physics problem. Homosexuality does not work. The body was not designed for that. This is where the debate should end.
6. Society encourages behaviors like marriage for its good. It discourages non ideal behaviors. If gay couples are worried about estates and financial medical issues there are already legal options for them.

7. Even the naturalist should oppose homosexual behavior since it does not have any survival benefit and in fact has the opposite effect. This would impede evolution. 
8. There are over 20 diseases caused by male homosexual acts. Why should we encourage this? An act that can damage someone should be warned about. To not warn is not loving. 

9. To disagree with a behavior is not anti-gay. If it is harmful, it is loving to warn people as previously stated. Society frowns on many behaviors already and it is not considered hate. Name calling is not an argument. 

I am going to license my car today so I show up at the dmv with a horse. They tell me sorry this isn't a car and so won't let me legally drive it on the street or license it. I keep saying that the horse is a car but we all know it is a horse. Marriage has already been defined and it is already legal for all. No liberties are lost. Sorry may be a poor analogy but hope you get my point.

And I didn't even mention the bible.


Also...for those who are naturalists, what objective standard can you point to for your views? At best you can only have an opinion on this. So whose opinion wins? Are you not forcing your morality on others as well? So whose values win? 

If we are evolved animals then we have no free will just as Sam Harris rightly points out in his new book Free Will. He says free will is an illusion....of course he contradicts himself numerous times after that. He says we really can't not help but believe what we do. So we have no choice. So how can anyone say what anyone says is wrong? Carl kathey or anyone for that matter is determined to believe what they do. This is consistent with materialism. All is matter and nothing more. Only a theistic world view allows us to debate these issues. So of course christians are going to use the bible as an objective standard of morality.

My questions are genuine and come from curiosity.

1) Personally, even if i don't belong to any confession or any organized religion nor i properly believe in a God in the way that many do, i find a lot of inspiration in many ""believer"" words. Like the [Desiderata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desiderata) for example. What do an atheist think about a text like that one? Do he find it inspirational, a sterile work of literature, total bulls**t?

2) Often i hear, as a justification on some rough statements against religion **in general**, that religion is a way to keep a man binded with fear and self-judgement. That it shouldn't be the starting ground for a politician (or another person of power) to build a public system of laws and rights. Usually this way of thinking finds my agreement but what if, instead of a fundamentalism, a leader finds inspiration in words like the ones quoted above in the first question? Is possibile that a spiritual path, even if based on debatable things, can make a person ""better"" in some ways? I'm not asking if this one is the right way for you, i'm asking if it's possible.

3) How do you define a ""good person"" from a social point of view?

4) Why do you think that all the human beings throughout history found the need to build a deity system? Do you think that the need for a God is radicated in our societies? And do you find this a weakness of our specie? If so, why (please, it's clear that fundamentalism and religious wars are an obvious answer)?

5) Do you think that can exist a spiritual way that views the nature and the universe with the same awe and fascination of science, based on doubt, wonder and constant search? How would you stand in front a philosophical/spiritual way like this one? Is something similar to what you're experiencing/have experienced in your life?

The title roughly says it all. I often see countless claims of religion exclusively causing from violent Middle Eastern oppression to North American discrimination. Is it such a wild thought that these could easily exist under the banner of Atheism? Numbers spawns 2 things, radicalism and support of that radicalism. If Islam was an extreme and highly isolated minority do you think any of the immense problems we see there would be happening? (Don't answer that, I know your answer...) 

The same superiority complexes exist within both. Whether you are calling someone an infidel or an idiot on both sides there are radicals that see it best to impose their influence on others. I feel pretty safe that exploding the population of those dedicated to one cause by say 7000% can easily turn their influence methods from words to guns, especially when both sides see their view as immensely important if not essential.

What about branch-offs too? You could easily say ""Well no true atheist would care!"" or any variation thereof. Yet this same association is tacked onto countless Christians who legitimately do want to follow Jesus. Do you seriously not think extremist factions wouldn't rise up? What about among the developing world(again the Middle East) where boarders and sovereignty is vague and in flux, where corrupt power hungry tyrants will use any means to unite people to hate others enough to kill them? I could easily see a faction, if not 20, which rises up and sees religion a direct bane on civilization and for the better of humanity it must be forcefully removed immediately.

I saw Redskyvar's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/nsp52/why_is_my_atheism_justified_heres_an_analogy_ive/c3bolki) to this [post](http://i.imgur.com/ucGco.png) and started debating with him on the issue. After spending 4 hours crafting my latest response, it seems that my efforts are going to go unreciprocated. So would like to see your take on it (our exchange is somewhere at the bottom).

To summarize, Redskyvar's main premise is that

&gt; Somethings are not provable but require faith.

He then expresses concern on the fact that atheists reject faith and treat it with a certain degree of abhorrence. Instead, they prefer science and reason, and base their conception of reality on those principles. However, they conveniently ignore the fact that as human beings, they operate and interact with others using a faith-based system of attachment, trust and respect (e.g. love, justice, equality of men). They do not realize that to some people, the concept of god is as fundamental and is based on the same faith as the system of attachment, trust and respect that they themselves use everyday.

However, his attempts at demonstrating that justice/love/equality are faith-based appear to me weak at best, and consequently I spent 4 hours writing a counter.

EDIT: Redskyvar replied, do take a look at it.  
I'm happy that this post generated so much response, and many of you have raised many important points that I've not considered before. A number of you pointed out that Redskyvar may be conflating two different types of faith - religious faith and the faith in ""I have faith in (something)"". However, I think Redskyvar is aware of the difference, is not arguing for religious faith, but rather in ""I have faith in **the existence** of god"". Note that religious faith encompasses faith in the existence of god, but both faiths are not the same. To quote hotpackage:
&gt;A belief is just an assumption that you've taken for granted. Faith is a baseless/unjustified assumption that you've taken for granted.

Many theists mistake their holy scriptures as evidence, and thus think of their religious faith as belief. But know that there are theists who acknowledge that fact, and correctly recognize their religious faith as just faith. Also note that not all theists believe in an anthropomorphic god that interfere with human affairs, and may merely believe that a god of some sort exists. I think Redskyvar is trying to argue in that direction.

EDIT2: And to point out something in case people get sidetracked - Redskyvar is **not arguing for the existence of god of any sort**. He is pointing out the fact that there are people who believe in god(s) of some sort and that they base their belief/faith on the same principles as everyone else.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_o3k9t,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/o3k9t/whats_your_response_to_the_claim_that_everyone/,

From the perspective of an Atheist, what would you ask me to consider in opposition to this belief?",Salemosophy,40,17,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1c8e0l/i_believe_god_exists_in_some_form_from_the/,"So, in my belief system, I am compelled to believe that a higher form of intelligence exists beyond what we are capable of perceiving in space, time, and consciousness. I would consider this form of intelligence, or perhaps this form of existence (for lack of a better word), to be what some call ""God.""

In my view, the notion of God is more often ""personified"" by the way in which religions attempt to explain what God is, much like the allegory of the cave in philosophy where one becomes aware of something they lack any capacity to explain. In dying, our awareness of this entity/being/plane of existence(?) emerges (the whole out of body experience thing - which I'm already somewhat aware has been addressed in the medical field). 

I once had a friend who was Agnostic (I think) who said there's a deeper question about the Big Bang and where the energy that led to it came from (sorry, maybe there are answers to this already). If this were true, does this leave any room for a higher life form or level of existence? 

Also, I've seen Atheists out there that are pretty annoyed with folks who believe in religion, especially Christians apparently. I just want to preface any discussion with this: I grew up as a Presbyterian, but for the most part, I won't apologize for the extremism of religion or anything to that effect. I accept all people as they are and respect that if you believe something, you have a valid, personal reason for believing what you do (whether it's based on experience, evidence, or what-have-you). So, please don't assume I'm here to be judgmental of your beliefs or in anyway expect you to accept what I believe.

My employee asked, ""would you bet on him doing it again the next season?""  

Me: No, There are 162 games a season, hitters average 3.5 At bats a game, and all he has to do it record an out (or fielder's choice) once and he would not have a 1.000 BA.

Employee: say he does it again, then again.  Then would you expect it?... It's like the bible of the 2500 prophecies in the bible 2000 came true.

Me:  I am unable to speak on this.  I don't know much about biblical prophecies but I would guess that this is wrong.  Since there is so much interpretation in the bible it is hard to distinguish parable and hyperbole from actual 'prophecy.'  If you want we can talk about this later.

I did my research on /r/debateanatheist and /r/atheism and came back with the facts and the prophecies which did not come true.  We discussed the issue with self fulfilling prophecies (the state of Isreal) and logic fallacies (sharp shooter fallacy among others).  Then we moved onto prophecies which did not come true. I started at the beginning with how God tells Adam he will die the day he eats a fruit from the tree of knowledge.  When Adam ate the fruit he did not die.  He lived for another 930 years.  

His and another theist's response were ""it could be metaphorically dead"" 

I shut down.  I told them that I would not have a discussion where confirmation bias was used to fit one argument. I redirected it to the quote and how it clearly states he will die. 

They both went back to metaphor again... so I gave them the sites I had read and stopped the conversation.  I don't believe that either read it (other than a comment about baby soup... mmm baby soup.).

Is there a better way to handle this when a theist changes what their interpretation or says it isn't meant to be taken literal?  I get very frustrated when they do this but I am in TX so they are sensitive to the subject of religion (aka I am wrong no matter how much proof I present)

Even though I'm a Christian, I've always maintained a healthy respect for atheist writers out there; specifically the great atheist philosophers - such as Nietzsche, Sartre, and especially Camus. It's also always been a great concern of mine to remain open-minded as I would hold that a worldview that is not continually being tested and examined is invalid, even if it is true (I confess to being a bit of a Kierkegaard nut as well). So imagine my surprise when a friend of mine on Facebook posted a link to Richard Dawkins' God Delusion videos.

Now, I'd seen Dawkins in a few debates so I was already aware of his philosophical shortcomings. What took me aback, however, was the way that for a video attempting to encourage free-thinking rationalism, it sure seemed to rely quite heavily on emotional appeal. This, by the way, is not something in Dawkins' approach that seems to be limited to these videos. It's also a trait I've seen, albeit to a far lesser extent, in Hitchens and Harris.

My concern is this: Wittingly or not, the New Atheists seem to be setting up a following that is functionally very similar to that which they are trying to abolish. Note well that I do not seek for a second to deny the emotional manipulation conducted by the church in the past and present, however what I am arguing is that for the New Atheists to fight fire with fire, so to speak, seems ultimately counterproductive to their ostensible goal of free thought. Rather than a society in which men and women hold to views based on their own merit, they seem to be simply providing an alternative shepherd for the sheep to follow. Even many atheists that I've spoken to have condemned the New Atheists for being ""populists."" At first I thought that was perhaps the result of a certain degree of snobbery but the more acquainted I become with the New Atheists, the more I can't help but agree with it.

I am still pretty young, and have only recently come to start seriously pondering my beliefs.  I have been raised as a christian, but I want to decide things for myself.  I knew since day one that everyone had their own thoughts on the matter, so I have made a point to listen to arguments on either side, but I still can't form anything solid.  I suppose I'm currently agnostic with a lean towards the belief in a god that is probably different than any religion currently in existence would describe.

Now, I have problems with the way people treat the bible.  People act as though it is taken straight from god and hang on every word, but that is clearly a bad idea.  We have several different translations of it, the authors are anonymous, time, individual interpretation, and a number of other things change it regularly.  Even if god does exist, the bible would certainly not be a reliable source on the subject (though arguably, the only we have), and I consider people who try to analyze it word for word misguided at best and crazy at worst.

On the other hand, a lot of the atheist arguments I see attack the bible and the people, but they don't have anything too solid to oppose the notion of a god in itself, that I have seen.  Heck, half the arguments I see boil down to ""if there is a god, he doesn't seem as great as you claim.""  Something else I see a lot is people treating evolution as if it debunks the notion of a god entirely, and from what I have seen that is just not true.

Basically, I get the feeling that a lot of people say a god is impossible because we have not been able to support it, and that evolution is impossible because the bible tells us god created the world in seven days, and neither of those sit right with me.  Is there actual science that suggests the belief in a god is wrong, or is it just the bible we can go against?  It seems to me that god is at the very least still a very distinct possibility, but it doesn't seem right to put true faith and conviction behind any holy book.

I'm pretty new here to r/DebateAnAtheist.  I've read quite a lot of conversations and I'm impressed with some of the atheist comments.  There seems to be a handful of atheists who don't mind correcting other atheist's bad logic or bad argument...for the sake of atheism.  I appreciate that.  And I'm learning a lot from all sides involved.  

I'm a Christian and I recently had a conversation with someone here about the validity of Christianity.  In our conversation, he repeatedly pointed out that the Bible was not credible because of all of the contradictions found in the Bible.  He pointed me to the this [pdf](http://www.project-reason.org/bibleContra_big.pdf) from Project Reason that lists 439 Bible contradictions.  

I decided that it would be a worthy project for myself to go through these one by one.  I'm starting with last contradiction (#439) and working backwards to the first.  My question is this:  Is the following a Bible contradiction? 

439. Where does God dwell? ps 9:11, 76:2, joel 3:17, 21 ≠ ps 123:1, ecc 5:2

Ps 9:11, 76:2, and Joel 3:17 say that God dwells in Zion.
Ps 123:1, and Ecc 5:2 say that God dwells in the heavens.

I have studied this for a couple of days and I have come to the conclusion that the person who added this to their list of Bible contradictions is reaching for anything just to expand their list.  Is this the standard that all atheists use when reading the Bible?   

My conclusion rests on the clear Biblical teaching that God is omnipresent and that He chose the nation of Israel to reveal Himself to and abide with in/through the tabernacle, and later the temple.  This is a fairly simple answer and there exists more to it (for example, Joel 3:17 may be referring to the future &amp; hence, no contradiction) but I wanted to keep it as simple as I can.  

Do you think this is a contradiction?  If so, why?  Does my conclusion ""work""?

My question to these people is always the same: If you don't live by the rules of your doctrine, how can you still consider yourself a Christian? The answer is usually something like,""I have a personal relationship with God"", or ""I don't believe in organized religion but I love Jesus."" I get that you want a personal relationship with the deity of your society, but it seems to me that the Bible is pretty specific about it's rules and about what actually makes you a Christian. There are the Ten Commandments, the Seven Deadly Sins, and a multitude quotes which are very straight forward about how you should behave in your relationship with God, Jesus and the Bible. It doesn't seem like there is much room for interpretation. I always thought, ""Well, if you aren't actively following your religious rule set then you aren't really a Christian."" So my question to Christians is: what is the point? Why tack on the Christianity part if you don't like most of what the Bible and your local churches have to say? Why not just be spiritual or agnostic? If you don't have much faith in most of what your religion teaches then why stick to it at all?

It seems a lot of discussions of religious belief often turn into discussions of truth, belief, and knowledge.  Pressupositionalists rely on this sort of tactic, attempting to take whoever they're arguing with out of their comfort zone.  Truth, belief, and knowledge aren't very often rigorously talked about among non-specialists in the way objects of scientific inquiry are.  This is probably because we usually don't need to think to seriously about these things since we all have a basic *practical* understanding of how these things work (we couldn't engage in discourse if we didn't).  It often seems like the concepts are completely transparent, but when we try to *make explicit* what we mean by these things, we run into philosophical difficulties.  So, as someone who does a lot of work in epistemology, I figured getting a few thoughts down as to how to treat these things and open up some much needed discussion about them.

First, ""truth"" ought to begin with a capital ""T"" only when it's at the beginning of a sentence.  A sentence is true if it says something that's actually the case (This very very broadly a correspondence theory of truth.  However the details end up being cashed out, most philosophers accept something basically like this).  So, ""the cat is on the mat"" is true iff the cat is on the mat.  

“Objective truth” is somewhat of a redundancy, since “relative truth” is somewhat of a contradiction.  Insofar as something is true, it is true for all of us, since, though we are embedded in different cultures and traditions, we all inhabit the same world.

We can think of a given belief as a sort of commitment to the truth of a particular sentence.  A belief is a sort of *taking-true.*  So, if I believe that Paris is in France, I'm committed to the truth of the sentence ""Paris is in France"" in the same way that if I assert ""Paris is in France"" I'm committed to the truth of what I assert.  

A given belief is knowledge if it is *warranted* (I use ""warranted"" rather than the traditional ""justified"" because ""justified"" ends up getting confusing and over-intellectualizes the issue) and *actually true*.  Since we are *largely rational* beings that *understand the world in certain ways* (evidenced by the fact that we can have *reasonable discussion* with others about the *world we share) most of our beliefs must, in fact, be true.  If most of our beliefs were false, we'd be like fish out of water, constantly bumping into things, unable to make sense of the world at all!  And, warranted by this explanation (once again, however the details end up being cashed out), most of our beliefs must be knowledge.

Most people working in contemporary epistemology endorse a *fallibilist* conception of knowledge.  Fallibilism is the thesis that we don't need to absolutely certain of something in order for it to count as knowledge.  Since I'm not *absolutely certain* of *any empirical fact,* if I equated knowledge with absolutely certainty, I'd have to say that *I don't know anything*, and that's patently absurd.  I know  lots of things, and everyday understanding and competence attests to this.

Is it possible that most of our beliefs are false?  I don't think so.  Someone might bring up the possibility of a sort of Matrix scenario.  Is this an actual possibility?  I'm not sure.  Either way, whether the universe is physical or a digital simulation, it's real.  If we're in a simulation, it just so happens that the objects we're talking about and interacting with are *virtual* rather than *physical* but they're still just as real.  David Chalmers has [argued this point](http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html) saying that the Matrix hypothesis is a *metaphysical* rather than *epistemological* argument.

So yes.  We have a lot of true beliefs, most of which are knowledge.  Epistemologists are working to figure out the details on how it all works, but the general picture really isn't that hard to get a grasp on. Saying ""I don't *really know* anything,"" or ""We'll never *really* know what's true"" is just plain silly.  Skepticism of this sort should have ended with Hume.

So, here is the situation..

My first and only love is a creationist and is very well versed and involved in her religion. She also has a strong education in science, however not really in anything ecology/evolution related (she is mostly micro-bio, pre-med kind of stuff). I, the student of ecology, cannot comprehend her inability to understand the concepts and logic behind evolution, and because she has already made up her mind, she really doesn't take the time to seriously study my arguments or the arguments that were presented to her in college level Bio (probably because they so contrasted with her world view in the first place).

Her contradiction to fossils are that we cannot date them using carbon dating (as she tells me carbon dating doesn't work for things past a certain age). Also, when asked about the geological fossil record she replies that a large flood event (noahs flood ftw) could mix up all of the substrate as it is dumped onto the land forming torrential storms and oceans, therefore mixing up all of the species into strata of sandstone. This is how she supports her belief that they were all alive at the same time.  While I realize this makes no sense due to a number of physical impossibilities and, even if this DID happen, the fact that substrate (rocks, sand, and mud) would tear these skeletonsa to pieces (sandpaper, force, the fact that fleshy bodies are very delicate compared to rocks, etc..) negates the fact that we find skeletons intact, so much so that we can determine some dinosaur behaviors (protecting nests, living in groups, etc..)

Besides this, she simply does not comprehend how evolution could work. Something in the background logic does not click with her, a product I'm sure of the world view in which she was raised. She completely denies the phylogenetic tree as she says just because animals look similar doesn’t mean they’re related. Where are the missing links she says? When I tell her how few of the earth’s creatures we know about that have existed in the present, let alone the past, she just shrugs it off.

This girl is VERY smart and aware. As an agnostic I really don't mind her Christianity (to each his/her own because the universe is one big mystery and there is always the unknown at the back of every story, aka where faith comes in) Also, while the path we take regarding our world definition is different, the end product of our value systems and how we wish to live our lives comes out the same.

In any case, I know she can understand it, it’s just a matter of her seeing things clearly enough to be able to change her mind after it has already been made up.

But really! It is so much work! Her conclusions are supported by the weakest evidence, feeble grabs at maintaining stability in her world-view (it is a big hit when one forfeits their world view). And i cannot currently present strong enough bullet proof arguments when things get down to geology, paleontology, physics, and theory regarding how conclusions are drawn.

Please Reddit! Help me show her the truth and help me with some untouchable arguments! I love her enough to let it be, but the problem arises with future possibilities, I cannot choose to spend the rest of my life with someone if they someday plan on raising children to creationism.

I have recently been delving into the subject of the historicity of Jesus, and have been coming across extremely varying results. As a proper skeptic, I have been attempting to get the most objective material that I can possibly find. I have listened to debates from the likes of Richard Carrier, Arif Ahmed and many others. However, I am genuinely finding that the evidence against Jesus' resurrection appears to be minimal. 

Of course, the burden of proof falls on the person who makes the claim, but I could never start from the presupposition that the super natural cannot occur. Rather I assume that it is extremely implausible, and that natural solutions should be considered before differing to the miraculous. 

But, the evidence from the epistles (Paul's letters) seems to be extremely convincing, at least in the sense that the early church members believed that Jesus died. Not only that, but ""group hallucinations"" of near 500 people would be just as miraculous as a resurrection account. 

When it comes to secular sources, the common assumption on reddit seems to be that there are absolutely none confirming the existence, let alone resurrection of Jesus. However, when I consult more objective historical sources, it appears that this is not the case. Josephus, for one, is famously noted for being fallacious due to early church forgery. However, there is reason to believe that the core of his message is legitimate, as well as his later reference to Jesus. Also the works of Tacitus and Plymmy appear to be more reliable than I would have thought. 

Anyways, I am looking for good, objective scholarly commentary on the historicity of Jesus. I am vaguely familiar with the basics, but I want to learn more. I hope that I did not come across as aggressive or harsh in any way, shape or form. I am just a guy looking to find the truth. Whatever that may be.

Thanks for the help.

**TLDR: What is the best way to debunk the historicity of the resurrection.**

Edit: Thanks for the great responses! When regarding the pinnacle difference between the historicity of Jesus and the historicity of his resurrection, my biggest quarrel is with the conflicting views. For example, the vast majority of historians, including many prominent atheists, strongly uphold that Jesus did live as a person. This is contrasted heavily with the views of leading atheists such as Richard Carrier and David Fitzgerald. It just seems that if the evidence was so one sided, that there would be general consensus on whether or not he lived.

Most of us are what they call ""agnostic atheists"". We don't believe in god the same way you don't believe in Santa Claus or Leprechauns. You can't be 100% sure that Leprechauns don't exist, but if we're being honest with ourselves, it's clear that they probably don't exist. We simply apply that same logic to the idea of god(s). Now don't get me wrong, there are some people out there who are ""gnostic atheists"" and claim that there is definitely no god, but they're few and far between (in my experience).*

Given the good logic contained herein, why does a large subset of the population believe in God? 

God is no more demonstrable than leprachauns, unicorns or the Tooth Fairy, and yet myriads believe anyways.

While there is nothing wrong with atheism, how do atheists deal with being the minority for thousands of years? What is so good about religion that it has stuck around despite that God is no more provable than Santa Claus? 

I think some here would argue that atheists are just smarter than everyone else, and that is why, but I can point to plenty of people who are quite intelligent - doctors, lawyers, philosophers even - who are believers. Why would they forego their good sense (and obvious capacity for logic) to believe in something so demonstrably silly?

Furthermore, what exactly are the benefits of atheism such that one would be led to choose it over some form of theism? I think there are a lot of ""intangible"" reasons that people become theists - that is to say - the decision is made not for logical reasons.

He concludes with “the explanation of the existence of the universe is God.”  But if this is the case, then it seems that Dr. Craig has simply obscured the fallacious reasoning.  We can easily reword the premise without changing its meaning:

&gt; Anything that exists has an explanation of its existence in an external cause; this external cause is god.  God does not have an external cause; his existence is explained by the necessity of his own nature.

If one were to prove something, one would need a basis or a series of assumptions and presumptions to prove that from, right?  In order to prove this chair I'm sitting on is real, I have to assume that what my senses tell me actually do reflect reality and that I'm not in a dream world or in the matrix.

Descartes contends that the ultimate assumption or presumption that we need to rely on to prove any knowledge at all is God.

Nihilism says that since we do not know what the absolute truth is (there *could* be a God, but there's no way to prove that.  there *could* be a flying spaghetti monster, but there's no way to prove that.), there is no way to prove that anything exists.  You can't prove that we're *not* in the matrix, right?  Therefore, you can't prove that this chair I'm sitting on exists, or that I exist, for that matter.

This is subsequently tied into the issue of right and wrong (not morality!).  It's possible that morality is evolutionary advantageous and therefore is a genetic trait that is selected for.  That's not what I'm arguing.

~Note: I'm equating morality in this sense with a conscience.

I'm arguing that as an atheist, you can be moral, but you do not have a basis or a set of assumptions from which to contend things like killing children or raping them is *wrong*.  It could be *immoral* because your evolutionarily developed sense of morality says it's not advantageous to do this, but you can't even begin to prove that it's *wrong*.

I'd like to keep this debate philosophical and leave science out of it.  I'd be willing to debate science vs religion some other time (I would argue that the two are not mutually exclusive).

Update:

My main challenge to atheists is this: How do you justify objective laws?  How can you tell one person, culture, or country that something they do is objectively wrong?  What if one person's biological disposition tells him that murder is to his advantage (sociopath, career criminal, etc.).  Who are you to say what they do is ""wrong""?  You can go kill him as retribution.  Without absolute ""right"" and ""wrong"", wouldn't society become pure anarchy as each individual lives by his own personal morality?  Why is this not this way?  How can you sustain objective ""rightness"" and ""wrongness"" and not only create laws but *abide* by laws that rely on this objective right vs wrong.

Doesn't abiding by and living by objective ""rights"" and ""wrongs"" go against true atheism?

We can move away from murder as an example because it's easy to argue that even if you *want* to murder, you won't because it's disadvantageous (other people will hate you because their individual biological morality says it's wrong).  We can talk about cannibalism, incest, slavery (domination by force i.e. North Korea), etc.

I got plenty more replies than I expected and it's become unrealistic to respond to them all.  I have to say I'm rather satisfied with what you guys have said.  I want to make a few things clear:

I love them like my brothers and it breaks my heart that they're not Christian.  I know *plenty* atheists who are, by my *Biblical* standards, *great* people.  Again, I'm not saying atheists are immoral.

- My only argument was against the *source* of atheists' morality, *which is present* (the morality, not the source).  To be honest the response posted by galedeep all the way at the bottom was my favorite.

- Just to clarify what went on here:

   - I said atheists have no source of objective morality.
   - Atheists say that objective morality is not necessary at all for them to justify what they do and don't do.
   - Some atheists said that a supernatural and transcendent source is not sufficient to say that whatever morality that comes from it is objective.  I won't necessarily argue against that, but I would say that a supernatural and transcendent source is *necessary* for objective morality.

- I would perhaps continue to argue that objective morality *is* necessary to justify what you do and don't do, but I honestly have no idea how to go about that so I won't do it.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,1344442558.0,,,True,t3_xub1m,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xub1m/how_does_atheism_not_descend_into_nihilism/,

1. What is the purpose of an atheist to convert others?
   
        Is there a higher purpose to converting theists? If so, help me understand!

2. Is there anything about Christianity that particularly makes it singled-out by atheists over other theistic religions?
   
        I know we have extremists and hypocrites, but so do other religions, as well as atheists. **Every** group has fringe elements that claim to be apart of the mainstream group. 
    
        Let's say size is not a factor, since I don't see nearly a comparative amount of posts about Islam.

3. Are atheists, or most atheists, nihilists, or humanists, or something else?

4. Why does it seem to me, and other Christians, that atheists seem to take the First Amendment as freedom *from* religion rather than freedom *of* religion?
    
        I would argue that the ten commandments in a courthouse is not endorsing a specific religion, but only recognizing it. I realize what secularity is, but there is also secularity to the point of censorship, which I believe is going farther than the separation of church and state was intended. What is it about other world religions that atheists want to completely get rid of them in public settings? Is it political activism, or does it relate to your answers to the first question?

5. Say something about why you chose Atheism! It shouldn't be, unless you have to, ""Why I didn't choose _____"", but rather more of a positive look on why you arrived at your thinking.

Given the nature of this subreddit, I've no doubt that it happens here on a fairly regular basis - how often does someone on here get smited with rational arguments and end up switching sides? I've no doubt that it's happened, but I'd wager that it's a pretty rare occurence. I want to explore the whys of that, a bit, so that we could possibly end up with a more robust form of discussion that could be more constructive (or, alternatively, worse).

But first, a story.

I heard the tale of how a young woman became a Christian. She had grown up atheist, her entire family was atheist, and she had gone most of her life without even really giving much thought at all to the notion of God. Anyway, things in her life start tumbling downhill very quickly, and eventually she's reached a point where all she wants to do is end her life. Her grandmother, who is also an atheist, starts insisting that she go to church, because she needs help. She's taken aback by this, because her grandmother is also an atheist and hates church, but after a bit of arguing finally agrees to go. So she's sitting in this church, in her grandmother's town, away from anyone she knows, and the pastor, during the sermon, says something along the lines of ""I don't know why I'm saying this, but I feel like there's someone in here right now wrestling with suicide, and I just want you to know that God loves you, and can help you."" She's a little shaken by that, but kind of writes it off as coincidence. As soon as the service is over, she bolts for the door, but as she's leaving, someone stops her and tells her they really feel like they should pray for her. So they pray, and she breaks down and everything comes out, and not only does she end up not committing suicide, she becomes a devout Christian.

So here's the reason why I told that story: As an argument for the existence of God, it is utterly impotent. I could be making it up. I could be telling the truth, but she was making it up. She could be mostly telling the truth, but embellishing a few things here and there. She could think she's telling the truth, but have a few details fudged by her perceptions at the time. Even if the story is 100% true, it's still not entirely convincing. It could be coincidence. It could be that her body language betrayed her hopelessness, prompting the actions of the pastor and Christian who prayed with her. Even if there were some sort of fate, or higher power, or something involved in there, it still wouldn't necessarily indicate the existence of the Judeo-Christian God in particular.

But here's the deal: As far as she's concerned, the loving, merciful God of Christianity came down to meet and embrace her during her most difficult time, saving her life by guiding her towards Him and informing others of her plight. To her, she's experienced God in a real, undeniable, life-changing way, and so the odds of empirical evidence or rational arguments causing her to abandon that belief are astronomical.

I argued, not too long ago, over in /r/DebateReligion that for most people, religious experience (or lack thereof) is the single largest factor in our decision as to what we believe (or don't) - and the consensus seemed to be in agreeance, as much as one can draw a consensus from anything on Reddit.

In other words, I would argue that for someone to coldly consider the evidence and discern the most likely possibility is exceedingly rare. Far more likely is that our personal experience becomes the screen through which all evidence is filtered - we decide what we believe, and then look for arguments to support it.

I'm sure that members of this subreddit are no strangers to this habit amongst theists: ""I don't know why I believe in God, I just have faith"" is one of the more frustrating answers one can encounter, I've no doubt. But it goes both ways, as well. I personally have yet to meet an atheist IRL who's said that their reason for atheism depends primarily on evidence. It's typically something along the lines of ""I don't like the idea of something being in control other than me"" or ""My life's been awful, and I've prayed to God that He might do something, and nothing's happened, "" or even ""I've had terrible experiences with the church and Christians.""

In fact, let's look at the story above. For every person who can say ""I was going to commit suicide but God intervened and saved me,"" there's at least one other person who can say ""Well, someone really close to me had no one intervene and they actually committed suicide, so where was your God then?"" And I think that sentiments like these are ultimately what end up driving our beliefs - at least, most of us. Our arguments often become a sort of veneer to justify what we already feel to be true - again, amongst theists and atheists alike.

And really, is that so incredibly awful? After all, we humans are not purely rational beings - we are also emotional beings. And while I'm certainly not saying that intellectual integrity is a bad thing, I do think that to suggest that someone who is both rational and emotional base their decisions purely off the rational side is to attempt to deny who and what we are. Our emotions will always play some role in what we believe, what we argue, and how we react - why attempt to deny that?

So here's the big point: Religious arguments turn into such a mess because no one is actually addressing anyone else's issues. We're taking something that's intensely personal and trying to turn it into some abstract, disconnected discussion, and most of the time it just doesn't work. That certainly doesn't mean that these debates are useless, as there are quite a few people who change their beliefs because of them. Even in those cases, though, I would argue that it is, largely, experience at work - they might say ""I was an atheist, but I just had this feeling that there had to be more to life than this, and then I heard that debate and..."" or ""I was a Christian, but I just had so many questions and so much doubt, and then I heard that debate and...""

Now, there will always be exceptions, of course - people who were firmly set up in one camp, until one book or one argument or one video made them change their minds completely, but they're rare.

So, here's the crux of what I'm saying, and I apologize for an overlong and rather muddled post: I think that rational arguments and empirical evidences have their place, but that if theists and atheists really want to be able to dialogue with one another, that's going to require talking about what experiences pushed us to assume whatever position we do. In practice, this is horrifically difficult, since it would require that we all be willing to bear our deepest secrets to a bunch of total strangers so that they can try and tear them apart. It would also run the risk of turning debates into a practice of simply comparing scars.

But I honestly believe that this is what's at the crux of the debate - that this is why theists and atheists have such a hard time seeing eye to eye, why the conversation tends to become so emotional so quickly, and why people, when their arguments have been refuted, often don't suffer any lack of confidence in their beliefs (or, again, lack thereof).

But I want to hear your thoughts: What are your opinions on the subject?

My question is: is this notion even possible? This may be straying into a philosophical discussion but can something exist outside of empirical investigation in such a sense that it can only be known through a faith-based worldview?

I cannot help but think that although a belief in the Christian God relies on faith, it too relies on 'soft' evidence such as emotion and personal conviction to reinforce these faith-based assertions. My first reply was that that too was an extraordinary claim which, much like asserting a god existed in the first place, required extraordinary evidence to prove but I'm unhappy with that conclusion on my part.

In our history many times we hit a wall in what we could observe and said ""This is it"" and then overcome it. Why the lazy answer, ""It just is, don't ask because you are stupid"". It's like saying God did it and God just is.



3) I don't understand why the concept of (absolute) ""Nothing"" is disregarded for not having grounds in the testable reality but ""the infinite"" notion is hugged so tightly by the multivers supporters and others. I find it simple, it's the lack of everything and it can exist if we remove everything. 




4) Krauss explains wonderfully how an Universe can come from nothing but I have one big problem:



--- Something that can pop from nothing is a law of the world. A law of this world cannot explain how the world came to be. It may explain our Universe, but not how there is such a law. 




5) The comparison of Hawkings troubles me, that the overall energy is (may be) zero so that is nothing. So if we have a balance with two perfectly weights the overall balance is zero so there is nothing there. Really? We have a balance and two weights and a law that annihilates them. That is something. 



Maybe I am missing something but the current answer should just be that we don't know.

Well, he's ""too busy"" to respond anymore and doesn't really have time for the questions. I've instead brought in **H**, who I previously mentioned is more intelligent and more open-minded. Her username is **lexgirl**.

To start, I'll post some of the questions you've asked answered in the comments below with the responses she's already given me, and will post some of your other questions in the comments below so that she can answer them herself from her own account. Feel free to ask more as we progress. **Be aware that these answers may take a bit of time to get to, so don't expect answers immediately. She is a very active individual**

Also, here is her preface:

These are some huge questions, and good ones. Let me start off by saying that there is simply no way to adequately answer them in this forum. A book could be written in response to each of these (and, I'm sure, they have been written already by people far more intelligent than I). Nevertheless, I will start off by making a few observations.

First - all of these questions seem to get at one main point that I often hear my atheist friends asserting: that Christianity is illogical. I don't dispute this claim. In many ways, it is illogical. This is why the Christian life (and really, perhaps any life) ought to be spent wrestling with what is true and what is not. A faithful Christian (or disciple of Christ) is one who consistently spends time trying to answer these difficult questions. Which leads me to the next point.

Second - Most Christians don't spend time trying to answer these questions for themselves. Many are afraid of where the hard questions will lead them. Others are so ingrained in the systems in which they were raised and indoctrinated that it doesn't even occur to them that there are worldviews and intelligent belief systems outside of them. I confess I have been guilty of both of these things at various points in my life, and I am sure I will continue to fail on both levels at times. A faithful Christian is one who is willing to grapple with the big questions. However, that does not mean we know all the answers yet. Which leads me to the next point.

Third - Sometimes, we Christians don't know what the hell we're talking about. There are times when we just really don't have an answer to something because it is something we personally are grappling with and sometimes we lack the humility to admit that. This makes us poor examples indeed of the message we aim to represent. As a Christian of some 20+ years, I confess, there are many difficult questions I am still working through and have not solved. I admire my atheist friends - many of them seem to have worked through the problematic questions more faithfully than I have at times.

Fourth - The fundamental divide that I see between Christians and Atheists (and the reason why there's a lot of back and forth mud-slinging) is because their fundamental means of determining what is truth (or, their epistemological system, if you are a word geek like me) is vastly different. Most (if not all) of my atheist friends are true products of modernity, relying heavily on scientific and empirical methods to determine what is truth and what is not (thus, the frustration with the Bible and other assertions Christians make which are not 'provable' with scientific means). Christians however often have a different epistemological system, one in which truth is garnered through a variety of means. For example, Wesleyan (or Methodist) Christians often rely on four main ways of discerning what is 'true': reason (yes, it's in there - and all the atheists rejoiced!), tradition, experience, and Scripture. So, it is not to say that Christians don't value scientific knowledge. Some Christians value it more than others (me being one of them - I think ignoring scientific data is truly ignorant). And some, fundamentalists for example, really don't value it highly at all if it competes with 'Scriptural truth.'

All of this leads me to the main point. The sense I am getting from these questions is that you are asserting two things: 1) Christianity has flaws, and 2) Since it has flaws, why should anyone believe it's claims?

This is where I think the problem lies. Because a system or a relationship has flaws or discrepancies does not rule it out altogether. All systems and all relationships have flaws. This does not negate the overall integrity of said system or relationship. For instance, if I discover my best friend has deceived me in some way, does that negate the entire relationship? Perhaps what he/she has said is negliglble - a little white lie. Does that mean that our relationship is useless? Does it mean that I cannot trust anything that he/she may ever say again? Maybe it was something bigger though - perhaps an act of deceit that was truly fundamental to the basis of our relationship. Does that mean that it was intentional deceit? Could I have misinterpreted what was said originally, in such a way that it was actually my own error, rather than the error of my friend, which caused the relaying of wrong information? Or perhaps our situation has changed and now the information is no longer valid. For instance, perhaps in the beginning of our relationship, he/she said to me ""You are the most important person in the world to me"" and later he/she married. Suddenly, the words from previous need to be reinterpreted in light of the changing situation, since his/her spouse is now the most important person.

All of this is just a roundabout way of saying that I think there are some bigger themes at work here than just answering those particular questions. I am glad to engage them and will certainly share with you some of my thoughts. I'll also freely admit when I just don't know the answers because I am in a journey along with the rest of humanity, and am still discovering truth along the way.

What keeps me a Christian is the truth I've discovered so far, which I cannot be convinced otherwise of. No evidence could convince me that there fails to exist a God who cares and a God who is involved in our lives. I can get into that more later, if you want, but it might just be more Christian mumbo jumbo that doesn't relate to the way you build meaning in the first place. And I can respect that. :)

Lastly - an apology. For all the Christians everywhere who have failed to take your good questions seriously, I say I'm sorry. For all the Christians that have rolled their eyes at you and treated you like you are lesser, I'm sorry. For all the Christians who have acted like they have the corner on truth, I'm sorry.
Sometimes we Christians do a piss poor job of living as Christ did. I'm thankful and grateful that you'd invite me into this conversation and look forward to giving you better answers when it's not 11 PM and I can think and see straight again. :)

* An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.

In all likelihood, when we die our cognizance ends. There is no evidence that any existence is sensible following our death. In other words, when we are dead, its the end for us. The closest ""feeling"" we have to after death is what we remember before our birth: nothingness. (Please note, I am not making any claims about what happens to our brains and senses as we experience death such as shortly after our last breaths or during a coma or partial death. I'm merely speaking about the time after complete termination/death.

Statement #2

Our lives are precious. The amount of time we have in our existence should be cherished, embraced, and not taken for granted.

Statement #3

Many diseases that prematurely shorten life are preventable by pursuing physical fitness.

Statement #4

We ought to actively pursue physical fitness and it should be considered high priority.

Can you please tell me which of the above statements you agree or disagree with? If you are overweight or obese, do you have an issue with it?

INITIAL COMMENTS:
I suspect one of the kneejerk responses to this post will be something about the pleasure gained from culinary indulgence. I do not argue against that pleasure, but it shouldn't take away from the honest pursuit. You can still enjoy an occasional Chick-Fil-A sandwich and burn calories later or skip every once in a while. This does not directly go against the pursuit of physical fitness.

Also, some may claim that you could substitute ""physical fitness"" with a host of other virtues. That may be true, but I haven't made the claim on other virtues. I'm just claiming my above outlined statements without regard to other virtues/vices.

Today, my Ethics professor asserted that agnosticism was a non-sensical fabrication for those who were unwilling for whatever reason to put the construct of God on the same level as other mythical deities, and such.  He posed a question to the agnostics in the room: ""Are you agnostic toward Zues, Santa Claus, Leprechauns, Unicorns, etc too?"" 

For those who would answer ""No"" here he points out that God is placed under different criteria for non-existance than the other mythical creatures and it is an apparent contradiction.  

For those who would answer ""Yes"" he would point out in order to be compliant with this answer you would be forced to be agnostic toward whatever supposed non-existent presence anybody made up (Zues, Santa Claus, God-Dragons, etc), which is irrational.

So my question is this: Does anybody have a counter to this to defend the agnostic position? If you answered no to the first question, for what reason is God under a different criteria? If you answer yes, what is your response to assertions of the existence of other supernatural/ imaginary entities?

TL:DR: Professor asserted that if your agnostic toward God but not toward other deities your being stubborn and just take the jump to atheism.

Possibly a long read.,waltmaniac,25,4,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/rzpo7/easter_debate_topic_is_the_historicity_of_jesus/,"As you all probably know this is one of creationists' favorite times of year to post outlandish claims on the internet.  One of my friends posted something about the resurrection and I responded facetiously (text below).  But, the accredited person who my friend cited responded with a pretty interesting comment.  

**My friend's OP:**  From (name omitted):

HAPPY RESURRECTION DAY FOLKS!

Here is one of my favorite conspiracies mentioned in the Bible. It is found in Matthew 28:11-15

11 Now while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened. 12 And when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers, 13 and said, “You are to say, ‘His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.’ 14 And if this should come to the governor’s ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.” 15 And they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.

Some of the guards? How many guards were there? (anywhere from a squad or two to a full platoon).

What were they guarding? Somebody that was killed.

Why? Because of someone stealing the body? C'mon, are you kidding me? The Romans were experts on crucifying people. The Jews wanted Jesus dead. And the disciples? They were hiding in fear that they, if found would be arrested and put on crosses as well.

The guards reporting to who? Oh, those who wanted Jesus dead, and got their wish fulfilled by the Romans.

What was the money for? Protection from a fate the the guards would be executed.

Could at be that the guards were asleep? What was the penalty for a guard sleeping on the job and that or whom he/they were guarding gets AWAY. Those guards if found guilty were not going home to their family.

What? Disciples stealing the body? Are you kidding me? Again, they were too scared that they would be put on crosses as well. Besides 11+ disciples against a whole platoon of Roman guards trained in conquering and killing. The disciples would have ended on the short end.

This passage is what we call enemy attestation recorded which just one piece of the puzzle making the account of Jesus' resurrection the real deal.

No one stole the body but the resurrection is a miracle prophecies by Jesus, fulfilled by Jesus. The crucifixion was the payment for our sin and the resurrection is the receipt and confirmation for our justification.

**My Response:**  He supposedly shook up Rome and yet he's suspiciously absent from Roman written record... strange. But, the bible says it so it must be true. That's not self-fulfilling at all ;)

**The accredited's response:**  Alright Justin, would you care to deal with this one.
CORNELIUS TACITUS (55 - 120 A.D.) Tacitus was a 1st and 2nd century Roman historian who lived through the reigns of over half a dozen Roman emperors. Considered one of the greatest historians of ancient Rome, Tacitus verifies the Biblical account of Jesus' execution at the hands of Pontius Pilate who governed Judea from 26-36 A.D. during the reign of Tiberius.

""Christus, the founder of the [Christian] name, was put to death by Pontius Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius. But the pernicious superstition, repressed for a time, broke out again, not only through Judea, where the mischief originated, by through the city of Rome also."" Annals XV, 44

With reference to the resurrection, of the seventeen [non-Christian sources], seven either imply or report the resurrection of Jesus. Let me encourage you to read Gary Habermas' and Mike Licona's book The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus.

There are plenty of alternative theories that have been hypothesized by critics to explain the resurrection of Jesus on naturalistic grounds but they all have failed to explain the data and are refuted by the facts.

Even if we were to utilize only the four minimal historical facts that are accepted by virtually all scholars secular and Christian alike, who deal with this issue, we still have significant basis on which to both refute the naturalistic theories and provide the major evidences for the resurrection.

* First, I apologize for not being able to do a simple screenshot, but I'm on my netbook since my desktop is being worked on and I don't know how to do it with this krappy little thing.

But, he brought up something pretty interesting.  Tacitus was apparently the first secular historian to mention Jesus or the resurrection.  Now, the Annals weren't written until around 118 a.d., so he didn't even live at the same time of the events.  He doesn't cite his sources in it so really he could only have been getting it from the Christian writings correct?  

I'd always believed that the character of Jesus was suspiciously absent from all written record of the time he lived.  Especially considering the amount of supernatural 'goings on' that was supposedly rampant (see:  Matt 27:50-54).  If all these things were happening and Jesus the man was shaking up Rome--why did it take 80+ years to get a reliable secular historian to document?  Also, since Tacitus was widely considered to be one of the best historians of his time--why the hell did he write that stuff?  Maybe he was just conjecturing or maybe the man Jesus was certainly crucified and some of those events were historically accurate?

I see it as avoiding the question. It seems logical to me that either you believe it or you don't. Whether you know it or not is a different matter altogether.

I got into a debate with a friend recently and I tried to explain to him the difference between atheism/theism and agnosticism/gnosticism. I suggested that he was most likely an agnostic atheist.

He disagreed, saying that since there is no proof that a pantheistic view of the existence of a God can't exist, he has to be an agnostic, not an atheist.

He's aware of what the words actually mean - but he proposed that his ""belief"" is absolutely neutral. Until there is evidence either way, he will not believe that god does or doesn't exist.

So my question to you guys is: **can you really be undecided on whether you believe or not?**

*My position is ""I won't believe the claim until there is evidence"". His position is ""I won't believe OR disbelieve the claim until there is evidence.""*
(so the argument is really about what the ""default position"" is)

To demonstrate such indecision, he gave me the following analogy: ""Say I have a bookshelf at home - the first book on it may be yellow or red. Which do you believe it is? Or are you undecided?""
I had to agree that I couldn't possibly decide on either belief.

Let me hear your thoughts.

MAJOR EDITS (deleted earlier stuff bc people were getting confused):

First I've read pretty much every post and thanks a lot, everyone has given me some really great insight, pointed out some major errors on my part and has helped me refine the theorem, here is the revised version with explanations:

Real quick points: 

1. true free will = the actual ability to control my own actions through any means, not an illusion

2. NOWHERE do I say this must be an all-knowing/all-powerful god or even a god at all, just that something beyond the physical exists that allows for free will.

P1. If skeptic, then belief in only ""x"" which is measurable and testable

sub-P1. god is not measurable or testable

sub-P2. if belief in only ""x"" which is measurable and testable, then no belief in god

sub-C1. if skeptic, then atheist

Everyone was very to correct to point out that I was ""putting the horse before the carriage"" by saying atheism implied the belief in only the measurable in testable, atheism only implies the lack of belief in a god, whereas skepticism (the form of it we are referring to here) refers to the belief in only the measurable and testable which then leads to atheism since god is inherently not testable or measurable, but on Reddit we tend to link atheism to skepticism so heavily that i made the error of equating atheism and skepticism and created a false premise as a result

P2. If belief in only measurable and testable ""x"", then belief in only physical ""x"" (meaning matter OR energy)

a lot of people complained about this premise, some said because energy is non-physical but this is my mistake for not being clear, when I say ""physical"" I mean both matter and energy, some people had other objections, but I stand by it, here is the reasoning:

sub-P1. If ""x"" is measurable and testable, then instruments that measure and test must be able to interact with it

sub-P2. if ""y"" is known to be physical and can interact with ""x"", then ""x"" is physical

sub-P3. instruments that measure and test are known to be physical

sub-C1. if ""x"" is measurable and testable, then ""x"" is physical

ok, back to the main argument:

P3. if belief in only physical, then belief in materialism (not many complaints with this one)

P4. if materialism, then determinism OR randomness

a lot of people gave me great insight about how materialism could lead to determinism OR randomness and I agree 100%

C1. if skeptic, then determinism OR randomness (either one), then again, modus tollens: if not determinism OR randomness (that is both must be rejected), then not skeptic

so right now, we're at, If I were to reject both determinism and randomness, then I must also reject skepticism, which does not invalidate atheism (this is the best part because now I can logically believe in free will without having to be a theist, which is what I was hoping for), but it does remove my root CAUSE to be an atheist, which is to say, without skepticism, I must allow for the existence of things I cannot test or measure, or things that are not physical, this leads down the path that since I appear to experience free will, and I have no reason to doubt that experience, I need to believe it is true free will, and that it is a non-physical free will since it cannot be tested or measured, but again this is ONLY IF I were to reject determinism and randomness

back to the determinism argument:

getting a lot of complaints about the determinism proof, I've formalized it to make it easier to dissect and gotten away from the computer all together:

P1. if determinism (or determinism/probability combo), then effects of all causes (or probability of effects of all causes) are knowable

P2. if effects of all causes (or probability of effects of all causes) are knowable, then an accurate prediction of (probability of) behavior of an actor must be knowable

C1. if determinism, then an accurate prediction of (probability of) behavior of an actor must be knowable

P3. if ""x""is knowable, then anyone is capable of knowing ""x""

C2. we must be able to inform the actor of the prediction (C1, P3)

P4. the actor being informed of the prediction is a cause

P5. if the actor being informed of the prediction is a cause, then its effect (or probability of effects) must be knowable

P6. assume the actor will be informed of the prediction

P6. If the actor is informed, the actor will be effected

P7. if the actor will be effected, the prediction must account for this effect and change the prediction

P8. this new prediction is knowable

P9. if the actor is informed of the new prediction, then he will be effected

P10. if the actor will be effected, the prediction must account for this effect and change the prediction (ad infinitum)

C3. due to infinite regress, an accurate prediction of (probability of) behavior of an actor is not knowable, therefore, no determinism (modus tollens)

hope this clears things up

as for randomness, I honestly didn't consider it at all when first formulating this and I thank everyone for all of the information. It has given me a lot to think about, I cannot and do not reject randomness at this time because I have not thought about or researched it as a possibility nearly enough.

So here we are, I'm now at the point where I must either accept randomness or reject it, if I do reject it then I need to accept the possibility of the non-physical free will. I know a lot of you had problems with the idea of a god (or other non-physical) allowing for free will, but again, the real purpose of this post was for me to see if anyone could describe an argument where true free will and atheism (now skepticism) are compatible, I have reached the conclusion that no they are not compatible.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_qjubd,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/qjubd/someone_please_help_me_with_this_i_keep_arriving/,

Therefore sometime in the future the human race could measure consciousness and as the definition of being scientifically proven, predict consciousness. Given the technology exists man could then create consciousness. 

Most if not all religions have the concept of dualism and conclude that consciousness is not only an affect of the brain but also that of the soul or spirit. 

Lets say we've reached this point in time and someone has created an artificial robot which looks and behaviours exactly like a human. This robot contains a computer which replicates everything in the human brain including emotion (fear, love etc) and using our latest technology this robot is conscious by all that is scientifically understood.

My question is, would you treat this robot the same as you would treat another human being? Would you hold the robot to the same laws, human rights, justice system etc.

Optional question assuming you believe it's possible; lets say once your body dies we can transfer your consciousness into the robot. Do you feel as a robot you should be treated equally to other humans beings?

-------------------------------------------

edit: I'm loving the answers but I think most of you who have just answered yes to each just based on how you personally would treat the robot. So it's time to get a little bit deeper!

If consciousness was to be understood scientifically then it would make consciousness rational i.e consciousness is the result of chemical reactions affecting neurons. Once you understand the formulas for the reacting chemicals is when we can create consciousness. Would it still mean that free-will exists?

Remember as mentioned before this is a computer robot, so the computer would crunch the numbers to stimulate the chemical reactions of the brain. Most of you have answered you would treat the computer brain the same as an actual person.

So what this robot was convicted of murder, would the murder be the creators fault or the robots? If it is the robots, would you throw it in jail for the rest of its life or would you simply turn it off?

The Agnostic viewpoint seems to be the assumption that: Since the lack of evidence isn't evidence of the none existence of a deity.
Thus, if we cannot entirely know that there is no deity, then we must assume the *possibility* of a deity.

However, to me this sounds rather strange. Just because we cannot prove that a deity does not exists to a 100%, doesn't mean that we *must* assume the possibility of a deity or even accept it.

For that, we must prove that the possibility exist - and the only way for us to do that is to use pure reason (as the whole point is that we lack physical eveidence for or against God, there is nothing to test but our reason). *However* this raises the question that Kant did:

* Can we actually learn something about the world purely out of reason?

And the short answer is no. You may formulate that A &gt; P iff A is true. But to see if (iff A)(given that iff A is a representation of a thesis in the world, i.e If there is Gravity then stones will roll down a hill) is true, you actually have to test it. (Using the logic language to prove logic formulas doesn't prove things about the world, only that the formulas themselves are sound given the framework they are bound in. 

You can't prove that Mary is a girl using the logic language - we can claim that she is a girl (A = B), but only once we investigate do we actually have sufficient reasons to believe in the *possibility of her being a girl*).

We can't even *test* the possibility of a possibility of deity. 
Thus, if we cannot even test that, we have no *reason* to accept the assertion that there is a possibility of deity - we can accept it as a thesis that there *may* be one, or many.
But accepting something as a thesis *is not the same* as a priori accepting the possible answers. We *still* demand an a posteriori answer and assume that the thesis is wrong until it's proven otherwise.

I am then, an atheist not because I ""have"" evidence against the possibility of a deity - but because *there are no physical evidence to which we can test against the  world to support the thesis that there is a 
possibility of one or more deities*. *I* do not need evidence against something which from the start has no anchor point in reality save for the constructions of arguments formed within the framework of our reasoning.

[Introduction](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xn11k/would_rdebateanatheist_be_up_for_a_book_review/)

[Chapter 1: *There Can't Be Just One True Religion*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xsm46/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

[Chapter 2: *How Could a Good God Allow Suffering?*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/zizxu/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

[Chapter 3: *Christianity is a Straitjacket*](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/11rq17/book_review_the_reason_for_god_belief_in_an_age/)

**Chapter 4 - The Church Is Responsible For So Much Injustice**

So what is he going to try to refute this time?

&gt;*""I have to doubt any religion that has so many fanatics and hypocrites,"" insisted Helen, a law student. ""There are so many people who are not religious at all who are more kind and even more moral than many of the Christians I know.""*

Let see where Keller takes this. 

&gt;Disillusioned by the combative and exploitative way he thought they used Bible to control people's lives, [a professor wrote] ""the thought penetrated my mind -- that the Bible might be wrong... It was my first step out of the world of faith...""

and?

&gt;If your experience with Christians [is bad] then the arguments for Christianity will have to be extremely strong for you to concede the they have any cogency at all

but

&gt; if you have seen churches that are devout in belief yet civic-minded and generous, you will find the intellectual case for Christianity much more plausible.

Ignoring the loaded language he used to create that dichotomy, maybe this chapter will be about our own personal bias and we will discuss how to approach situations objectively and evaluate arguments using reason rather then emotion.  

&gt;So we have to address the behavior of Christians that has underminded the plausibility of Christianity for many people.

Damn... 

&gt; every act of goodness, wisdom, justice, and beauty is empowered by God [and] God gives out good gifts of wisdom, talent, beauty, and skill ""graciously"" -- that is, in a completely unmerited way.  He casts them across *all* humanity, regardless of religious conviction...

So if I do a good deed its because God wanted me to?  And Gods desire that I (or any other person) do something good is completely random?  

&gt;Good character is largely attributable to a loving, safe, stable family and social environment -- conditions which we were not responsible.

Wait... I thought you said God is responsible for 'good character' and he allocated it randomly.   What exactly are you trying to argue Keller?  Let me summarize so far.  1) good character comes from a random number generator we call God, 2) good character character comes from social environment, and 3) nothing about being a Christian increases good character. So don't fault Christian beliefs for bad Chrisitian behavior because it is your perception of individual Christians that will determine if you believe Christian claims. 

So now that Keller has the most convoluted premise set up lets see where he takes it.

&gt;Now imagine that someone with a very broken past becomes a Christian and her character improves significantly over what it was.. [and imagine a really well adjusted women that is not religious]... Suppose you meet both of these the same week.

Wait what?  Why is the Christian improving her character significantly?  Did she win the good gifts lottery from god?  Also why are you assuming I am terrible at statistics?  Anyway lets continue

&gt;It is often the case that people... who are ""lower on the character scale"" are more likely to recognize the nee for God and turn to Christianity.

(Imagine their disapointment when they find out god isn't going to help them anymore than before.)

&gt;We should expect that many Christians' lives would not compare well to those of the nonreligious.

Set the bar as low as possible... I feel like I am listening to political pundits prep the audience for a Presidential debate. 

&gt;Violence done in the name of Christianity  is a terrible reality and must be both addressed and redressed... however, violence has been [equally] inspired...by secularism...  We can only conlude that there is some violent  impulse so deeply rooted in the human heart that it expresses itself regardless of what the beliefs of a particular society might be.

Keller goes on to talk about how sometimes Christians can go off the deepend and express their disdain for groups like 'homosexuals' or 'evolutionists.'   (tangent: does Keller not believe in evolution?  Thats not what he is trying to express here but whenever I hear the word 'evolutionist' a red flag goes up in my mind. )   He rebuts these Christian fanatics with the good old no true scotsman. 

&gt;What if, however, the essence of Christianity is salvation by grace, salvation not because of what we do but because of what Christ has done for us?

He follows this up with a priceless anecdote.

&gt;Because they think of Christianity as a self-improvement program they emulate the Jesus of the whips in the temple, but not the Jesus who said, ""Let him who is without sin cast the first stone"".

I aggree the bible does send mixed messages.  Keller shift gears with a series of vague self-indulging statements.

&gt;Marx, according to Westphal, was unoriginal in his critique of religion --the Bible beat himi to it.

&gt;As Swiss theologian Karl Barth put it, it was the church, not the world, who crucified Christ.

These lines made me laugh.

&gt;What were the prophets and Jesus criticizing?  They were not against... obedience to Bibilical directions for life. [They were against the obtainment of power via] appeasing [God] through... good works. 

&gt;[God] cannot be manipulated by religious performance -- he can only be reached through repentance... Jesus charged his disciples: Whoever wants to be great among you  be your servant.

&gt;The bible teaches us that our treatment of [the poor] equals are treatment of God.

Keller then moves to his favorite argument that is shared by C.S. Lewis.

&gt; strong secular critics of Christianity are really using resources from within it to denounce it.

&gt;Where, then, did we get this list of virtues by which we can discern the church's sins?... from within Christian[ity]

&gt;to give up Christian standards would be to leave us with no basis for criticism. 

Keller then walks us through history with the most insanse selective bias to demonstrate that Christianity improves societies.  Wait what are you arguing?  

&gt;As a historian, [Sommerville]... showed how Christianity changed honor-based cultures [Anglo-Saxon in this example] in which pride was valued rather than humility, dominance rather than service, courage rather than peaceableness, glory rather than modesty, loyalty to one's own tribe rather than equal respect for all.

Keller then goes on to explain that whenever Christians did bad things it was the left over bad parts of the cultures they took over.  (I thought we weren't arguing that Christianity made you better... whatever)

&gt;When Anglo-Saxons first heard the gospel they were incredulous... When they did convert they were far from consistent. They supported the Crusades.. let monks and women... culitvate charitable virtues that weren't appropriate for men of honor. 

Keller goes on to credit Christians for the end of slavery

&gt; those who campaigned for the end of the slave trade [didn't] stand to gain in any tangible way... Slavery was abolished because it was wrong, and Christtians were the leaders in saying so.  Christianity's self-correcting aparatus...had asserted itself.

the end of communism

&gt;the Catholic church in eastern Europe refused to die under Communism.  Through ""patience, candles, and crosses"" it began the chain of events that brough down all those totalitarian regimes

standing strong against Nazis

&gt;the Confessing Church, the Christian congregations that refused to sign an oath of allegiance to the Nazis.  

and the civil rights movement

&gt;When people give their lives to liberate others as Jesus did, they are realizing the true Christianity that Martin Luther King, Jr., Dietrich Bonhoeffer, and other Christian voices have called for.  

I am still trying to figure out what Kellers argument was.  This chapter was all over the place.  It almost sounds like a brainstorming exercise on a vague topic.  Instead of working through arguments and figuring out what he wanted to say he just decided to go with his first draft without proof reading beyond clicking spell check.

Some considerations:

Is to say that evidence is more valuable because you can make accurate predictions based on it, actually begging the question? Isn't ""that which allows you to make predictions"" simply the definition of evidence?

How does one decide what is evidence in the sense of causality? Is statistical likelyhood really good enough, and if so, why?

I'm just going to try to summarize these videos: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LIj7HNfKd8&amp;feature=plcp (just 1 part but you can find the others from there). As an intro, Tim Keller is a pretty influential author and pastor across America. He preaches in NYC.

He begins by saying that Christianity must be intellectually credible and existentially relevant, and that most Christians only pay attention to the later. He goes on to address the ""intellectually credible"" claim:

1. Quoting Huston Smith, only 2 people have had such incredible influence on the world that people asked who are you or what the fuck are you? Buddha and Jesus. Buddha denied worship, claimed he was not god. Jesus accepted worship, and claimed he was THE God. There have been dozens of people who also claim to be God (e.g. David Koresh) but theyre nut cases and never gained influence like buddha or jesus. There have been many influential people but they don't claim to be God, its cuz their humility/character helped them become so influential. 

2. The claims of Christianity are great. This is the ""data"" that must be dealt with intellectually and explained.
a) Jesus claimed to be God the Messiah and claimed to be bringing the Kingdom of God to earth.
b) hundreds of people saw that Jesus apparently conducted miracles by account of the NT
c) Jesus convinced the people close to him that he was god. The last people on earth who would believe that a real person was God were the 1st century Jews. The 1st century Jews had an understanding of God who was above, outside, transcendent of the world. For 2000 years prior to Jesus, the Jews were trained culturally to never worship anything created, as commanded to them by their 10 commandments (1st and 2nd commandment).
d) After Jesus died, hundreds of people confessed and attested to see him risen, citing Paul from 1 Corinthians.
e) The experience of that changed the lives of his followers so much that they died to spread the news.

3.
5 options for explanation

1) Contention: Jesus is a legend, we don't know any of this happened. The tales of Jesus have been embellished over time... written down many years after Jesus' life. 

Three reasons to refute this contention: 
a) The Bible is not written as legend, but it is written with the intention of being historical account. E.g. Gospel of Luke: ""Many others have drawn up accounts of Jesus' life just as they were handed down to us by the eyewitnesses, so I have made a careful investigation of everything from the beginning, and I've written an orderly account so that you may know the certainty of these things."" Luke is saying he's not an eye witness, but he writes like an investigative journalist. The Gospels are not written as legends.. Theyre not good enough as legends. If they are not history, then they are realistic prose fiction that has not existed before 18th century. Example, in the story of Jesus forgiving the prostitute, the author says Jesus sat down and started writing in the dust. That addition has no particular significance in the story, and is a mark that the gospel accounts were meant to be real accounts. Realistic prose fiction is how fiction is written now (e.g. ""She came to the door and turned the knob"") but that style was non-existent before the 18th century. Legends/fiction of the 1st century is not written in that style. From a literary view, the Gospels must be gibberish lies, or attempted historical accounts. 

b) Gospels written around 70ad, and paul around 50-60ad. If you're going to fabricate stories, you should wait until all the eye-witnesses are dead. All the new testament documents were written within the lifetime of the eye-witnesses. Paul said 500 people saw Jesus raised from the dead. Paul wrote this down 20-30 years after the ressurection. Those 500 people Paul wrote about were still alive. This corroborates the point that the new testament are historical accounts.

c) Did all the early christians die for a legend/hoax? Quoting: ""Why did Christianity, among all the other competing cults and religions in the Greco-roman world, succeed? With more severe opposition than other religions, with no influential backers in high places but consisting mostly of slaves and the poor, why did Christianity succeed and force the most powerful state in world history to come to terms with it? There must have been, at the start of Christianity, a vast release of energy, perhaps unequaled in our history"" It's a possibility that all these early christians died for a lie... but put that together with the idea of when it was written, the Christian faith could never have gotten off the ground. They couldn't have said the tomb was empty unless the tomb really was empty because of the cultural view of resurrection, or that people saw Jesus raised from the dead unless people really did see him raised since those people were still alive.


2) Contention: Jesus was just a good teacher.
Answer: Jesus couldn't be just a good man. He was either who he said he was, or a liar/lunatic. He says, ""if you want to follow me, you must hate your father and mother."" ""anyone who wants to save his life will lose it, but anyon3e who loses their life for my sake, will find life."" If you want to follow Jesus, you must give him everything. You must love him so much, that love for your family, career, all things must look like hate in comparison. No good person has ever said this. A man who claims this is either God or on the level of a poached egg. Jesus could have been a liar and/or a lunatic. I.e. Jesus fooled his followers.

Here Tim Keller seems like he switches a bit to address ""existential relevance:"" 
But look at the quality of JEsus teachings. Its not the raving of a madman. 

He quotes GK Chesterton

""If I found a key on the road, and discovered it fit and opened a particular lock at my house, I would assume most likely that the key was made by the lock maker. And if I find set of teachings set out in pre-modern oriental society that has proven itself of such universal validity that it has fascinated and satisfied millions of people in every century, including the best minds in history and the simplest hearts, that it has made itself at home in virtually every culture, inspired masterpieces of beauty in every field of art, continues to grow rapidly and spread and assert itself in lands where a century ago the name of Jesus Christ was not even heard; if such teaching so obviously fits the locks of so many human souls, in so many times and so many places, are they likely to be the work of a deceiver or a fool? In fact it is more likely that they were designed by the Heart Maker…""

If you look at the accounts of Jesus,  does it look like a lunatic? If Jesus were claiming these things now, we'd still be discussing: ""who the hell is this person leading such a pure life but making claims we never heard of before?""

quote: ""He combined virtues no one had ever seen before: tenderness without weakness, strength without harshness, humility without the lack of confidence, passion without prejudice, holiness and unbending convinctions without a lack of approachability, power without insensitivity, harshest judgement on the self satisfied yet the most winsome kindness to the broken  and the marginal, and never inconsistent about them, never a false stepever a jarring note... ""

The 1st century jews, who were culturally trained to not believe in anything transcendent in this world, felt they were looking through the substance of human flesh, the very being of God. 

The alternative, that Jesus was a deceiver and liar, means that half of the roman world converted into new morality and new unselfishness.

Aside:
The historical evidence for Jesus' life is better than the evidence of Caesar's gallic wars. But, it doesn't matter if the gallic wars happened or not. It doesn't matter to us if its true or not. However, no one can objectively evaluate the bible, no scholar, nobody, because if Christianity is true, we must lose control of our life and change the way we live, for him. Many historical scholars are skeptical of Jesus' account because of this bias.

But IF such a God exists, would it be better if we were absolutely and constantly aware of Him watching and judging us? Would that not change absolutely everybody's behaviour and motives? In the religion that I subscribe to, fear of punishment or hope of reward (after death) is not considered a pure motive for doing anything, and were God to be a ""Big Brother"" figure, this would be made very difficult to avoid. To me, if a God exists, it would make far more sense for Him not to have such an active and scientifically confirmed presence. What are your thoughts on this?

Also, on the topic of human suffering. All human suffering is terribly sad, but a fair amount of it is caused by other human beings and is avoidable. If a God existed, would it be preferable (from our viewpoint) that God had created a perfect world where everybody was continuously as happy as could be, and nobody's actions could worsen or improve the condition of themselves, or others, or society? To me this sounds awful, we would effectively be no better than sheep. It makes no sense. Can human suffering then be used as realistic evidence for the atheist viewpoint?

I'd just like your thoughts on these topics, if you don't think its silly to think about any of it considering it is a very hypothetical discussion for those who think it is highly likely that there is no loving and omnipotent God.

And on my beliefs, I do believe there is such a loving and omnipotent God, but I am not absolutely convinced of it and I am aware it is possible that there is no life after death. However, considering my knowledge and experience, on the balance of probabilities I believe it is far more likely that there is such a God. Also, I believe that my beliefs improve my life. I understand the atheist viewpoint however, especially considering the nature of the world and universe we all live in.

While its criticisms have proven overhwelming, I think its importance has been understated. The gravity of an a priori proof of God's existence would be immense, and the reasons for its demise are great as teaching tools for critically considering metaphysical arguments. As a result, I'd like to hear what the atheist community on reddit has to say about it, for or against.
In case you've never heard about the Ontological Argument, here it is:
-We have a conception of God as that being which has all perfections. -Existence is a perfection (or, existence in physical reality is more perfect than existence in the mind alone) -Therefore, God must exist, by his definition and our conception of Him.
Discuss!
N.B Kant said famously ""Existence is not a predicate"". If you are familiar with that line of argumentation, do not simply say that. Explain your view (or Kant's, rather).

**Edit: Some of my comments have been getting downvotes, and I'm wondering what the policy for that is on this subreddit. Is it as a function of disagreement or for something else entirely? If my comments are just trying to further debate then why the downvotes? Do any of you think I believe in the Ontological Argument? That would be absurd. I'm simply trying to promote debate. A simple brain exercise, if you will. No reason to attack my karma score for playing devil's advocate.**


**Second Edit** This is to address some common responses. I've seen many people argue against this simply by inserting some obviously non-existent thing in place of God in the statement of the argument, and that *might* be ok, but it needs clarification. What I mean to say is that it's not OK to say that, because there are suitable objections, namely that the Ontological Argument doesn't apply to those kinds of beings, and it only applies to ""that which none greater can be conceived"" i.e. God in this sense. Basically, St. Anselm will say to you Optimus Prime, perfect porridge or perfect pie people that there's no reason to conclude the existence of *those* things, because their perfection isn't the same as *God's*, which encompasses everything. God is special because he is a necessary being. I assure you there are many refutations to these assertions, but I leave it to you to further them!

**FINAL EDIT: Ok so in my opinion this was hugely successful (though I did catch one or two disrespectful people and I didn't appreciate that as much). Regardless, good job everyone! It's prompted me to think of more challenging points to bring up on this subreddit. You might even expect one soon. On a final parting note, though, I wil admit a strong sense of disappointment in reading comments about philosophy being ""mental masturbation"". Truly, these comments are grossly unfair and out of place, not to mention inaccurate. As some have replied, philosophy is extremely important in our lives (indeed, are you not in this thread precisely because you're philosophizing? Do you not despair when arrogant theists presume conclusions without granting their audience proper philosophical consideration?). Without critical thinking (which philosophy teaches) and acceptance of a wide variety of divergent ideas (also philosophy) this thread, and more generally proper debate would not exist at all.

It's my father, he's a Quasi-christian-who-knows-what? He has two resources he basis his religion/life on, and therefore forces it on us. Joel Osteen and Life after death stories from YouTube (People that say that they died and then came back to life)

Well there's one more, what got him (back) into religion as a teenager was an experience he had while high. He said he saw giants and when he said Jesus the giants ran away in fear, and from then on he knew that there was more to this life than just people. (How is this guy my dad?)

I should probably note that he's a lawyer and therefore sees everything as true until proven false, that and he's good at arguing... -.-

I just barely got into a debate with him after i came out as an atheist. He gave me two stories, one of them was that a person died then came back to life, but while they died they're spirit went out of their body up towards heaven, but as she was coming back to life her spirit was coming back to her body they saw a shoe on the roof of the hospital. So when they came back they said ""there's a shoe on the roof of this building"" and sure enough there it was!

My counter (in so many words) was that this sounded like bullshit. I asked for proof and he said ""The proof is the testimonies of the person who died and the medical personnel that checked on the roof."" I said they were lying. He said that i had no proof that they weren't telling the truth. I said he had no proof that they WERE telling the truth. He said that i'm denying that because it doesn't fit into my world view and that i'm closed minded. He then went on to tell me a different story. 

(well actually he went on to his experience while high and a 
""prompting"" that made him meet my mother when he was in college, and then retold the entire story of the shoe person again.)

This story is that an old woman died in a hospital and her son's came in and started talking about the will and what they wanted etc... BUT THEN~ The lady came back to life and promptly told them that she had heard all of what they had said when she was a spirit outside of her body.  I again said they were lying and he again said i had no proof, and then went on to say everything he had already said again as well.

He also claims that people's spirits are the ""electricity in peoples bodies"" I asked him if that means that phones or TV's have spirits too. He said that phones aren't alive, i told him he didn't answer my question. He changed the subject.

Then he asked me how i can have morals if there is no god. I told him the golden rule. He asked what makes people follow it, i told him that a lot of people don't because they're asshole's but that some do because people aren't ALWAYS asshole's (again in so many words, i can't even say hell around the guy, much less asshole.) He said that if I believed that then why do i not believe that those people died and came back to life. (Including Jesus.) I told him that that had nothing to do with anything we were talking about and he said that he had stumped me. Then we got home (this arguement took place on a car ride) and we stopped arguing because i don't want make my little siblings listen to us yelling. He's fine with that though (I know this from experience seeing as i have older siblings.) 

**TL;DR my dad is arguing that Jesus was the son of god and came back from the dead because no one can prove other wise, and that i can't have a moral compass without religion.**

He replied: ""Does it side step the question, ""Does God exist?"" Not necessarily, but the distinction that I am making is that it moves the dialogue from proving de facto a universal affirmative to the de jure concern of holding belief in God. I think that this is important since we are not concerned with what someone believes as much as why they believe it, at least that is the purpose I believe argumentation serves. This is one of the points that Plantinga makes in his A/C Model for warranted belief.

I said, “Such an assertion is probably impossible to support with evidence or argumentation.”

First, I retract this claim. The claim that God exists is not impossible to support, but I do think that it is impossible to certainly prove.

The distinction I made is not very helpful, and if anything it’s nonsensical. What I mean to say is that the burden of proof is not for the theist the need to prove the existence of God as an objective ontological truth. When discussing the burden of proof, we are concerned with epistemic warrant. The burden of proof is for the theist to prove that belief in God is warranted. The difference being that a warranted belief is an epistemological claim about the ontological matters of fact—these are the only sorts of claims that require burdens of proof, while an objective ontological truth is one of which is axiomatic (which may apply to this matter if we were to consider the ontological argument), and therefore is not in need of a proof to establish its truthfulness.""",,False,,t5_2ryfy,1360433049.0,,,True,t3_186y0v,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/186y0v/theists_who_say_do_not_assert_that_god_does_exist/,

However, there are many things in our experience that we rely on such as law of non-contradiction to even function in our world. Logic, math concepts, language, etc. are things that exist but not apart from intelligenice. These are non-empirical realities. We could envision where man and/or created intelligence did not exist. However, how could we imagine a realty where the law of non-contradiction did not exist. These things are necessary for anything to be. An Eternal Almighty God is the intellegience in which these non-empirical fundmental realties exist.
Concerning, the jabs at Christian religion itself. One could spend much time not liking particular things about another religion or philsophy. Yet, those are not necessarily contradiction with said system of belief.
I refer you also to Cornelius Van Til and Greg Bahnsen works about defense of the Christian Faith. Greg Bahnsen had at least two public debates with atheists that is available on audio download and probably transcript form also. Also, Douglas Wilson had a public debate with an atheists that is downloadable.

He has started to send me information and lectures on Pluralism -- the notion that many or all religions can be ""right"".  He takes the position that Christianity is the one true religion and that a logical analysis of the definition of truth vs. falsity requires that one religion be true.  Therefore, Pluralism fails.  I suppose he is trying to appeal to the logician in me.  In his words, [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LaYPQ_oSuWc) ""answers a lot of questions"".

Of course, underlying his argument are two false assumptions:  (1) one religion must be true; (2) Christianity is the true religion because the Bible tells us so.

They throw an argument at me and after i respond many times they would skip to another argument. 

I found the best way to debate theists that believe in the personal biblical god is to keep steady on one single argument, one point, until you explore it completely.
What I usually ask are two main questions and I keep at it without allowing the conversation to sidetrack or flow into some other aspect of god's existence.

The two questions i usually ask are:
1)IN what way does God exist?How would you define his existence and in what way does it answer the definition of existence? 
2)Faith is defined as believing something is true without proof.
Why do you choose to believe something is true without proof(or without evidence as some will point out nothing can be 100% scientifically proven)?

Many times i have noticed that those willing to consider these two questions, or one of them, and attempt to answer them end up saying that god must be real because of some emotional necessity they personally have.
Might be a fear of death or that otherwise life isn't fair without final judgment of the wicked and the good...
Of course if a person admits to himself his faith is rooted in emotional needs like that the road to doubting his faith is not far.

Some will try and say there are evidence of god's existence like a fulfillment of their prayers(some extraordinary coincidence they witnessed) or someone miraculously healing despite their doctor's prognosis.
This can be shaken by asking if The particular case could have been a coincidence and not god's work.
That god might have helped you with something else but could this particular case just be a coincidence.
Most will say yes and than it follows that all the miracles the person witnessed could have been coincidences.

Some background information - I am getting a masters degree in mathematics/theoretical physics at Cambridge. I was raised in a non-religious household and have always been an atheist, essentially by default.

It seems quite clear to me that God by most conventional definitions does not exist. This is not the issue.

My question is why must we live our lives according to what we deduce to be true, rather than what is interesting and perhaps beneficial? Selecting a religion allows you to assign a narrative to your life, acting a part as it were,perhaps making it far more interesting. 

I find that if one believes that one is very noble, and spends time showing his devotion to nobility (through ritual or prayer), one can be inclined to behave with greater nobility. I use nobility as an example, but the general point is these rituals and beliefs can change one's mindset, and there is no reason to presume (as is believed in r/atheism) the results are always negative.

The fact that most religions contain sections that contradict modern morality isn't really an issue - one may simply pick the sections that one wants to keep and define that as their belief system. Hell, you can even create your own religious texts! It seems like a pretty interesting exercise. The point is, by then believing in these texts with a religious fervour, you can experience life from a new perspective (again, acting a part as it were).

As for accusations of cognitive dissonance, I have no problem in knowing something is untrue yet getting into amental state where I believe it to be true. I think most people on r/atheism are far too strict on this issue - we are not perfect automata, only frail creatures whose laws are more psychological than logical. Why not accept that

TL;DR What is fundamentally wrong with living one's life according to a fiction/delusion?

Edit 2: Again, thank you guys very much! Apart from a little hostility, you guys have been a real pleasure. Sorry, my internet is fading in and out, so I might be very slow moving around. Thanks again :D

Edit 4: Seeing that my post is not being well-understood (which is my fault), here is a summary of the logical argument.
/

/

/

/

1) Through life, a suitable reasonable objective is to maximise the happiness of oneself and others.

2) It seems highly probable that there exists a theoretical set of beliefs such that belief in them can maximise net happiness, both for oneself and one's neighbours.

2)A) This set of beliefs need not be based on any current religion. It needs only be, at it's basis, irrationally founded.
2)B) Given that the set of beliefs is arbitrary, I claim that we could find one that avoids all the commonly held arguments. Hence, comments like ""It's not right for you to bomb abortion clinics"" don't belong here.

3) As such, having realised this is possible, it is quite logical to adopt a set of beliefs on the basis that it improves the happiness of yourself and others. 

3) A) A common counterargument seems to be based on the truth as having some inherent value. This does not seem to have a good logical foundation, at least certainly not more logical than maximising total happiness.

3) B) In fact, theoretically if espousing a truth means you fail to maximise total happiness, then you are choosing not to maximise total happiness due to a (possibly groundless) belief in the inherent value of truth. One could easily consider such behavior, quite paradoxically, as irrational.

4) If the above argument holds, then the basis for the arguments against ""religion"" as a concept (rather than in application) are very poor. In fact, religion then has a perfectly logical rational basis (though I am not making any claim about any current religion, only on it's potential).

He still holds a lot of Islamic views (e.g. on homosexuality, etc.), although he is very ""Westernised"".

We were just having a little debate. He was arguing that *jinn* (like spirits/demons/unseen beings that Muslims believe in) exist and that they possess people, and I was arguing that it's impossible, and that these people merely have a chemical imbalance in their brains.

This is how it went...

**Him:** My brother was possessed by a jinn once. It was in him for months. He thought he was Jesus. 

**Me:** Huh? And what was *really* wrong with him?

**Him:** He went to the sheikh, who said he had a jinn in him. Then the sheikh got rid of it. You white people would've just throw him in the mental ward, and locked him up!

**Me:** ... Where he could recover with therapy and medication. I don't believe that something could possess somebody.
 
**Him:** You don't understand. I've seen it on Youtube. The guy has a jinn in him, and when the jinn talks, his voice changes and goes all deep. It's really scary.

**Me:** Dude, there's no evidence for the existence of jinn. There is evidence for mental illness, though. And evidence that medication and therapy is what helps a lot of people with mental illness, not some sort of exorcism. 

For example, I knew a guy who had Bipolar Type 1, and he regularly took medication which stabilised him and balanced his brain out. When he stopped taking his medication, he went into a state of mania for about a week until he had to be hospitalised. When he got back on a regular cycle of medication, after some time, he was able to function again. He didn't go to a sheikh and get told he had a jinn!

**Him:** Whatever. It's religion. You people don't understand.

*... Sigh.* Somebody please tell me what to say to him, because I give up. Give me a better argument for next time, or something like that. It's worth another try, though he's pretty ignorant about this sort of stuff.

We tend to just avoid talking about religious topics overall, which is a bit of a pain in the arse, really... I'm not very good at debating, and I really need to improve on my arguments and knowledge for the future.

Here's the scoop, I'm an atheist and I've been emailing a pastor back and forth. I have a lot of key points that I want to reply with to his comments, and the part of morality all written up. (please still share your input!) I thought I'd ask for some of your thoughts and knowledge, because you're all wonderful, and I think it'd be extremely helpful in piecing it together perfectly!  To sum it up I asked him how he as a believer morally justifies all of God's immoral actions. If you can lend a hand debate the email! Thanks :)

&gt;on what basis do you even ask about moral issues in the Bible? You call the stories of war, ""genocide"" ""mass murders"" ""condoning of slavery"" etc. atrocities but according to what moral superstructure? Is that an arbitrary label or is it grounded in a worldview?
 
&gt;This is very critical to my response. Let's say I do believe in the God of the Bible and that he is very just AND very moral. Then I view his actions might be very differently. You might say that I'm evading the question but really I'm not. I think that abortion is immoral, but many people don't - perhaps yourself included. So our categories are very important and I'm curious to hear how you arrive at your moral categories, because I think (and this IS an assumption) that you likely don't have a defined objective moral standard. If that is the case, then don't have an intellectual foundation from which to even pose the question how I as a believer can morally justify the immoral actions of God. And if you do have a defined objective moral standard, how do you arrive at it?
 
&gt;My question to you is - how do you justify YOUR moral categories?
 
&gt;However, that being said, there is justification for God's actions which is important as a believer. First I would suggest two resources that would help in a much bigger way than a short email. A book called ""Is God a Moral Monster?"" by Paul Copan and a message by Pastor Kris Duerksen here at Southland called on ""The Law"" (last two messages in the series) You can download the message on iTunes or from here .
 
&gt;Here are my thoughts:
1. God is ruthless against sin and rebellion. (This is also the basis for the eternal judgement against an eternal God.) Sin is not just ""bad"" it is high treason against a Holy God. Therefore rebellion must be dealt with accordingly. Interestingly the nations and cities that were destroyed almost always had a chance to join Israel. In fact Exodus speaks about the many foreigners who were adopted into the nation of Israel as they went along through the desert (not the least of which was Rahab the prostitute from Jericho who hid the Hebrew spies - she is even mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus!)
 
&gt;2. Keep in mind the culture of the day. Compared to the other ancient kingdoms, the Israelites were instructed on nearly every occasion to push out the people as opposed to annihilating them (as their enemies tried to do time and time again, even to this day!)
 
&gt;3. I'm not sure that I can think of a time that God condoned rape - I think you may be mistaken here.
 
&gt;4. When it comes to slavery or even say divorce and polygamy, these were never the ideals, they were concessions made by God because he is patient with his people. So there were practices that actually reflected the pagan cultures around them but didn't reflect the true heart of the Jewish religion and God restrained himself from punishing those sins.
 
&gt;Two further points:
1. People often point out the bloody record of the Judeo Christian faith (and I don’t deny the very real violence that the Church did in the name of religion… it's disgusting) - but what must be remembered that the past century was the most bloody century in human history and almost every global conflict was at the hands of a dictator who was primarily atheistic in their philosophical worldview. This is very significant and brings me to point 2
 
&gt;2. Christianity has done more for the plight of the underprivileged, oppressed and marginalized than any other faith. Christianity is a faith of peace - it is true that God reserves intense wrath and punishment for sin and evil and those who participate in both - but it is motivated by the most jealous love. I promise you, come at my wife or my kids and you will see a normally pretty passive husband and father turn into a fierce protector! If I love my family enough to protect them physically - even violently - how much more would God protect the good in his creation against the effects of sin and evil? This was precisely the case in the Old Testament where the other nations were pulling the Israelites away from God. I think God acted in a supremely moral way given his intense love for his creation.

People didn't really have experimental science. Sure, logic was around - and really popular with writers - but this was never intended to adopt the constraints of that discipline. 

If religion were logical, it would be science. Instead, I always think of it as fiction. For example: Yes, I know Captain Ahab never existed. But Moby Dick is still a powerful novel that could potentially change someone's life. Art can influence the way we receive and categorize information, it can affect our relationships in society, it is real without being based in reality. The Bible doesn't need to respond to reproaches of historical inaccuracies, because frankly it doesn't matter if anyone of it really happened. It looks for a truth than can't be attained by logic or science. Also, science contains a truth that religion has never been interested in.

1323719760.0,20,self.DebateAnAtheist,n9zk7,I'd like to Challenge my Logic and Ideas. ,JonoLith,28,8,150,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/n9zk7/id_like_to_challenge_my_logic_and_ideas/,"Hey there everyone, 

 I've had this idea banging around in my head for a long time, and I just want to post it here to try and flesh it out and see what comes of it. It began when I was asked to define Religion. 

 The only fair answer I have to that question is that Religion is the opposite of Science. It might utilize Science, and it certainly cannot deny Science, but it is most definitely the opposite of Science. 

 So what is Science? The answer jumps up immediately. Science is the study of life through the empirical lens. If it cannot be proven, it cannot be Science. So, Science is the empirical study of life. 

 This means that Religion needs to be the un-empirical study of life. An attempt at grasping at the things in our existence that Science doesn't have authority over. Things like Love, Relationships, Community, Hate, Fear, ect. 

 What I find interesting about this, is that it means that people who study Religion are actually incapable of proving anything, because, be definition, Religion is un-empirical. The phrase ""I can prove nothing, because I have nothing to prove"" seems to capture something for me. 
 
 What this means is that it allows us to pinpoint fundamentalism very easily, and separate it from the Religious mind. One is more then welcome to say ""There is a God"" or ""There is no God"", and be comfortable with those ideas. However, when one says ""There is a God and I can Prove it."" or ""There is No God and I can prove it."" They have become a fundamentalist. 
 
 This is because they are taking a Religious statement, which is inherently not provable, and attempting to apply Science to it in the belief that the simple act of doing so makes it true. Science rejects their ideas easily enough, because the idea of proving the existence of God is as unScientific as it gets, (If God was Proven, he/she would be Science. As if God is a person to be found in the first place.) and Religion must reject the idea simply for trying to prove something empirically. 

 What this leaves us with is an acceptance that Science holds vast wonders and truths about the universe that must be accepted, and conversely we have an acceptance that Religion must exist, simply as a by-product of our own existence within the universe, AND we have the ability to perceive fundamentalist thought, root it out, and remove it from the conversation entirely.

However, I'm not asking for people's deconversion stories (which I am otherwise very interested in hearing), I want to find out how many of my fellow atheists were at one time Young Earth Creationists. At what point in your deconversion did you loose this particular belief and what exactly was it that ultimately led to you rejecting it? 

I'm from Britain where evangelicals are uncommon, YECs are rare and deconverted YECs (presumably) are even rarer. I myself was an extremely outspoken Creationist throughout my secondary school years - resulting in a lot of heated discussion with both Christians and atheists, both my fellow students and my exasperated teachers. Much of the time, being inexperienced in anti-evolution rhetoric, they had difficulty dealing with my arguments.

Ultimately, as I discovered an increasing number of holes in my belief system at large, I was encouraged to investigate further the debate between Evolution and Creationism. Once I made the conscious decision to actually examine the ""controversy"", my position was undermined very quickly (thanks in no small part to the likes of Thunderf00t, AronRa and cdk007).

For me, rejecting the notion of Creationism was the turning point in my deconversion, it allowed me to continue the examination of my religious convictions to a greater degree than before and would ultimately lead to me discarding them entirely.

At least on Reddit.,keatsandyeats,30,12,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/enibu/atheists_dont_debate_me_to_change_my_mind_at/,"When I ask the atheist why he bothers arguing with the Christian on Reddit, he invariably responds that he is attempting to curb the legislation of Christian morality that threatens to dehumanize his gay brother, villify his feminist wife, and indoctrinate his children.  He will then generally counter with, ""I have no problem with you believing the way you do - but I want you to stop voting and procreating.""

I believe this is a lie.  

I mean, for obvious reasons the atheist does have problems with Christians procreating, voting, and generally believing in fairytales.  But that's sure as hell not why they're on Reddit.  I think that atheists engage Christians, particularly on Reddit, for several reasons, and it's rarely as altruistic as defeating the injustice of the Inquisition.

- **They enjoy feeling intellectually superior.**  It's probably fun debating a smart Christian, but I imagine it's a singular joy when the Christian's response is ""just believe,"" ""answered prayer,"" ""Lewis's trilemma,"" ""Holy Ghost,"" ""spiritual encounters,"" or ""watchmaker argument.""  (Appeal to faith, confirmation bias, excluded middle, god-spot, infrasound, Hoyle's fallacy.)

- **They want an outlet to react.**  With religion pervading culture, influencing the child's earliest thoughts to the very president's words, I'm sure it's nice to kick back in a largely atheist environment and take out your frustrations by hopping on /r/Christianity and posting a couple of brain-busters about the maundering incoherence of faith or the sadism of the Old Testament God.

- **It's a fun game with easy rules.**  I assume most of you haven't read the Koran, right?  Bhagavad Gita?  Probably a few have read the Talmud.  The point is, you debate Christians on Reddit because you already know the drill.  Other religions are only ever brought into the fray as ancillaries to the meat and potatoes of Jesus-baiting.  ""Joshua stopped the sun?  Interesting, 'cause Mohammad split the moon!""

- **They want a reason to believe.**   I agree, it's probably not many.  But I feel like a few of them are probably grasping at straws following a lifelong charge at an invisible windmill, dealing with the maddeningly inexorable loss of their parents' religion and the philosophy that will invariably replace it.  They'll jump at any argument to return to Christianity - an argument that will never come.

If /r/atheism is *actually* trying to change Christians' minds, it's obviously not very tactful or effective (generally speaking).  I'm not saying you guys don't drag a Lutheran or two kicking and screaming to the dark side.  Simply that that's not your objective. 

So I want to hear the three words I've longed to hear from /r/atheism since I joined Reddit: ""We love you.""  Wait - that's not it.  I meant, ""You're *kinda* right.""

It just seemed like a more logical transition for me. 

EDIT: Thanks for the expeditious replies everyone. It's much appreciated. For those just joining the conversation, here are a few things that have already been addressed or that I will now address. 
1. Yes, I could've worded this question better. My mistake. I understand that ""Atheism is a lack of a belief in a deity; not (necessarily) a denial that any deity exists"". This has been said.
2. This question is not assuming that EVERY ex-Christian left their church because they found the idea of an omni-God illogical. But some do, and this question is specifically tailored for them. For those who simply replied along the lines of ""Evidence=0"", this question was not really for you but for those who, again, specifically found the idea of an omnipotent/omniscient God unsavory during their time as church members. 
3. Initially using the word ""logical"" in my description was in bad taste on my part. Thanks for pointing it out. Perhaps I should've asked if this transition was more natural a progression than just jumping ship all together. ""Natural"" seems more appropriate.
4. Finally, somebody asked how could a God that was neither omnipotent or omniscient be called a God. Though my definition of a God varies drastically from the Christian view, lets just assume its ok for the sake of conversation. Pretend I just said Deity if that helps.

ME(Haroon):
I just got your voicemail and you asked these questions:
Why do you have these questions? What is your concept? ( I Assume you mean about the existence of God) What are your feelings? ( I assume you mean about god) What do you think? (I'm going to combine this question with the one above it) Have you studied other books?

First, I want to talk about the burden of proof. The theists are the ones that are burdened with the proof of Gods existence. For example, if you accuse someone of killing their wife, then you would have to provide evidence. You cannot require the husband to give evidence to prove that he did not kill his wife, that burden of proof is on the accuser. In the same way, everyone is born an atheist and has no religious beliefs. Then religious people make the claim that God exists and then the child has to make a choice. IN the same way, theists have to provide evidence for the existence of God. And there is no proof of God existence, so the claim that theists make about God is invalid. For this reason, no one can ask someone to provide ""proof that god does not exist"" because then would we also have to provide proof that unicorns don't exist? No, first there has to be substantial evidence that God does exist before we go that way.

The reason I have these questions is because I see no proof in the existence of God. In the same way, I do not need to worry about unicorns or monsters when there is no proof for their existence. In the same way, the only thing that says God exists is in the Holy Quran. But what credibility does the Quran have? Only the Quran says how accurate it is but that isnt very credible. Say I had written on a napkin ""The napkin religion is true, because it says so right here on this napkin"". That isnt very credible but that is essentially what the Quran is doing. The quran is saying, ""I'm right because I said so"". If someone published a scientific article about a new discovery and the only proof that they give of this discovery is ""Because I said it was true in the article"" no one would give it another glance. Why do religious people go to their holy books when they are just as invalid?
So my feelings about God existing are the same feelings I have with unicorns and fairies. There is no proof of their existence, so why should I believe them? I am searching for the answer, but even a whole book made for the existence of god (""Our God"") I could find very major flaws in all of his arguments. Even being in a very high position on the religious ladder, Hadrat Mirza Bashir Ahmad could not make coherent points.

And yes, I have read probably two islamic books every week while reading the quran every two or three weeks since I got to college. I read a different Quran everytime also. The reason I do this is because I am trying to get more knowledge about Islam. However, my biggest problem here is that I NEED to read more books. You may be confused as to why that is a problem. Islam teaches us that the Quran is the perfect book and you will not need another book to go about your lives with. Why do people insist everyone read many many more books and the Quran with commentary? That means you are adding to the words of God and the words of God are not sufficient. If you need more than the Quran than it isnt the only book you need and isnt the perfect book. Then muslims might argue that the Quran has many interpretations and you need more books to understand what the Quran says. But if the Quran is a perfect book, then how is it even OPEN to interpretation? In other words, how would anyone mistake the words of God for something else if the book is indeed perfect? All of that proves that the Quran isnt perfect. By that conclusion you come to verse:

[54:18] And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy to understand and to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?

This also not just goes into Arabic. The second line uses the word ""anyone"". So whether you speak english, urdu, arbabic or hindu, the Quran and the word of God should be easy to understand. We know now that that particular verse is incorrect because apparently the Quran isn't easy to understand. Then what else might be wrong in the Quran? If the Quran is perfect and easy to understand for everyone, then why are there questions about the Quran? Why do we need commentaries?



USMAN:

Good to hear from you. Hope you are doing well. These are good questions (assuming they are in good faith in an attempt to learn) and we should definitely engage them.

First of all I think we have to address the scope of the problem. I think we have to acknowledge that there is no way to absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, prove the existence of god. If it were possible to do this, then there would be no one who would need convincing. There are many things that are very much suggested like man made climate change but because there is no one test for it, people can dispute it. So all we can do is provide convincing evidence that very strongly indicates the existence of a superior being and take people to that point but the rest is up to them.
I think we have to make a distinction between the arguments for the existence of god and the arguments for the veracity of the Quran. We can look at the existence of god with many different arguments - from philosophy (ontologic argument), biology, physics (physics of immortality by tippler).

Richard Dawkins and others have argued that natural selection explains evolution completely but others point to irreducibly complex systems (such as the clotting cascade) that cannot be explained by natural selection. I think the symmetry of the universe is too elegant to be a random phenomenon. Mathematics is said to be the language of the universe and if theory is not elegant, it is often felt to be likely wrong - this is why Einstein said god does not play dice with the universe. I can give you additional resources to read if you want to explore these issues further.

As far as the questions about the Quran go, I am not sure where is he is getting his information. No one has ever said that it is the only book you need. Don't get caught is argument which is only partially correct in its assumption - yes we believe to be a perfect book but not that it's the only book needed. Advances in science, mathematics, physics are all independent of the Quran. However it is the moral teaching and the proof of revelation that is perfected in the Quran. Your friend in making a strawman argument - stating incorrectly that we believe a feeble idea that he can then knock down. Khalifa Rabia's book ""Revelation, rationality"" is a an excellent work not because it introduces new arguments but because it shows how the verses in the Quran are applicable to science and predicted events - it offers logical arguments showing the truth of the Quran. As far as ""anyone"" being able to understand it, the phrase ""men of understanding"" is often used to describe those who take heed- this person's arguments strike me as superficial - ask him to be more specific in his critique.

There is much more to say but let's start here.

As Usman bhai rightly pointed out the questions you raise are very important. One must get satisfactory answers to them, for they are the very foundation of religion and belief. This question has been asked by man of all ages and still eludes man of the 21st century.

This quest of yours could take some time until you are fully convinced and believe in a God. You are very intelligent in your reasoning and logical skills but just keep an open mind as we proceed with this endeavor. Keep searching and if you are sincere in your desire - you will attain it. If you are just trying to play an intellectual game and outsmart the 'ignorant' religious thinkers then it will be a difficult journey.

Let us begin with broadly defining what is meant by God. Let us assume God does exist. What is He or Who is He? I attribute God to be a CONSCIOUS BEING. Would you agree with that assessment? What does the word God represent to you?

What kind of proof would convince you that there might be a God? Are you looking for some scientific proof, some miraculous event, something supernatural, something tangible...?
I would try to address these general principles first before getting into the Holy Quran and what it says. The Holy Quran itself is a great proof of the existence of God, but NOT because it says so. This could be a discussion in itself at some other time.

One suggestion I would make for you, in addition to the intellectual journey, is to ask God Himself. This may seem like a strange request, but please give it a try. What have you got to lose? Every night before you go to sleep, the very last thing you should do is ask Allah or God:
People tell me that there is a God. He is the Master of the Universe, Creator of everything, the all Supreme Being. O God, I am in search of You. If You exist help me find You and lead me to You. 

Provide for me some proof that I know You exist.

Do this simple 15 second exercise each night, pondering over these words - feel free to substitute your own.

It might be a stretch since this is no where near as prolific as Christianity but well, I respect the intelligence of many people around here so it's worth a shot.

Note, I have a very poor understanding of the theory myself as I have only just learned of it. My mother is adamant that I would be swayed if I just sat down and read Wilber's books.

The [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_Theory) about integral theory reads more like an advertisement than anything. A quick perusal of the citations proved to be just as unhelpful as the article. Eventually I started reading [Wilber's page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wilber#Quadrants) which *did* define some terms central to the theory. Unfortunately, I still don't understand much at all. Either I'm stupid or this theory is just that convoluted.

Thankfully talk pages exist and from there, I managed to get two outside criticisms of Wilber, both attacking his misunderstanding of evolution:

1. [Frisky Dirt](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxtc2FjbWFnYXppbmVzcGFydHR3b3xneDo3MmViYWI4NmE2ZjJmMzk0&amp;pli=1), which helped me understand one of the ideas behind the theory a little better.

2. [Kazlev](http://www.kheper.net/topics/Wilber/Wilber_on_biological_evolution.html), who, despite this rather scathing piece, appears to still respect the general idea behind integral theory as a whole.

More telling for me than anything was the writing from Wilber himself when confronted with criticism:

&gt;Publicly, virtually all scientists subscribe to neo-Darwinian theory. Privately, real scientists -- that is, those of us with graduate degrees in science who have professionally practiced it -- don't believe hardly any of its crucial tenets. [...] Instead of a religious preacher like Dawkins, start with something like Michael Behe's Darwin's Black Box: The Biochemical Challenge to Evolution. And then guess what? Neo-Darwinian theory can't explain shit. Deal with it. 

The problem now is that despite knowing some of the flaws in the theory and most certainly the flaws in Wilber's character, I still don't understand it well enough to refute it on my own. My mother couldn't even explain the core tenets of integral theory to me, instead choosing to just tell me over and over to read the books with an open mind. I'll admit, I'm extremely reluctant to even open one of Wilber's books at the moment because so far, everything about this has reeked of pseudoscience. I brought up Wilber's ridiculous writing above and she accused me of discarding the entire theory because of his misunderstanding of evolution.

And now, the real challenge comes to light: my mother believes that there are things science will never understand and that the absence of evidence is not a reason to not believe something. That is, she subscribes heavily to personal experience and ""spirituality"". This is the one barrier I've never been able to overcome with her.

I would be eternally grateful if someone who actually understands integral theory could debunk it because I'm having a really hard time.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_zhv0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/zhv0r/my_mother_subscribes_to_ken_wilbers_integral/,

In any proper scientific experiment, you formulate a hypothesis, devise a way to test the predictions of that hypothesis, collect tons of evidence, and then either conclusively reject or tentatively accept the hypothesis based on whether and how well the evidence fits.

But how would one test the hypothesis that other minds exist (edit: or rather, the hypothesis: All creatures with brains have conscious minds)? One only has access to their own mind, and no way of accessing the minds of others. The confirmed existence of one conscious mind is extremely weak evidence to support any kind of general conclusion involving other minds. 

The whole thing is both untestable and unfalsifiable, and it seems to me that if rational humans had no emotional desire to believe that others had minds, they would dismiss such a hypothesis as entirely as they dismiss the God hypothesis.

Is there any way to logically justify belief in other minds that isn't faith-based or intellectually dishonest?

However, I've grown up Church of Christ all of my life and attended a Christian college for four years and consider myself a Christian, so I've been exposed to this stuff for a long time. For those who don't know, Church of Christ is big (BIG) on scripture and is considered one of the more conservative branches of Protestant Christianity.

Recently there was a post on Reddit asking how we can trust the Bible when it advocates slavery. It's a common sight to see people bring out verses from the Bible that seem absolutely ludicrous (not touching pig skins, selling your daughter, stoning people for seemingly preposterous reasons) and I always want to find a way to reply to that person. First, to understand where I'm coming from, a little background:

The way I was taught is that the New and Old Testament are labeled differently for a reason. Yes, the whole Bible is holy and God-breathed, but we aren't told to follow every word of it sentence by sentence. The Old Testament was the original law designed for the Jews by God himself. This is primarily the first five books (pentateuch), including Leviticus which has all of the orthodox laws in them. These laws were designed to protect and organize this group of Jewish nomads and to keep their paths straight in a world full of polygamy, religious cults and the like. Most of these laws have been proven today to have had scientific merit at the time, though the Jews obviously weren't privy to this. (http://www.ccg.org/english/s/p015.html)

Jesus came to fulfill the law (Matthew 5:17) which included a bunch of prophecies throughout various books of the OT. Once that was fulfilled, ""Christians"" (God's chosen people now extended beyond the Jews) were no longer bound by the old law but instead are given the new law, which comes from the New Testament.

I know I'm getting a little lecture-y, so let me sum it up. Before Jesus, God held people to the Old Testament. After Jesus, the sphere was extended to include non-Jews and no longer required the old law, but instead the new law, which is given to us in the New Testament (Sermon on the Mount, parables, etc). Those are the verses we're held to. The Old Testament is still there as a way to learn and to see how God's plan for his people has moved through time. Just my personal belief. 

So I still eat pork and I'll be around my wife when she's on her period (even if I don't particularly want to be) and still feel good that I'm not committing any sin for it. New Testament verses are what I'm held to, which still includes the verses about homosexuality, but that's a whole other conversation.

This is not meant as bashing on anyone for anything but is my own personal opinion. Differing viewpoints are welcome and eagerly awaited.

TL;DR God's people were held to the OT, are now held to the NT, so Levitical law matters in a message sense but not in a practical everyday sense.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_t57uq,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/t57uq/the_distinction_between_the_old_and_new_testament/,

For those who aren't familiar with the term EULA Christian, it stems from the fact that, at least in the U.S., a surprisingly large number of Christians don't read the bible.  The term refers to End User Licensing Agreements that come with software - the ones no one reads; we just scroll to the bottom and click ""Agree.""  Presumably, these non-bible reading Christians are doing the same with the bible.

Now, let's suppose that atheism becomes the dominant cultural position by a slim margin.  After a grand celebration to make Nero blush, we take stock of our, ah... adherents.  I strongly believe that what we'll find is that there would be a significant number of people who would self-identify as atheists, but wouldn't have more than the foggiest notion of empiricism or logic.  They'd spout ""science brought us vaccines and computers, so I'm an atheist"" and other such things, but when pushed for details, they'd be as clueless as the 60% of Americans who can't name 10 commandments.  In other words, they'd be EULA atheists instead of EULA Christians.

So what can - and will - atheists do differently about this?

* Pro: Atheists would put a lot more emphasis on science education, which would hopefully reduce the number of people who don't understand it.  With luck this would mean fewer EULA atheists, but I'm not sure this is guaranteed - and it would take a generation or more.

* Con: Atheists don't have the group support structures that most religions do.  Even if most Christians don't read their bibles, presumably their preachers and priests do (now that would be a fun survey...) Atheists are still working on building our support groups - but even the most optimistic atheist should feel like we've got a ways to go.

* Neutral: Logic and reasoning.  If creationism has taught us anything, it's that just because you have sound logic and science doesn't mean poeple will believe it.  One of the biggest problems, as I see it, with faith and holy books is that *anyone's* interpretation is as valid as anyone else's.  That's how divine revelation ""works.""  Atheists I think assume that because science *doesn't* work that way, that we'll have an advantage with these EULA atheists.  I don't think that will be the case at all. I suspect even when provably wrong a large number of people for whom that proof goes over their heads will ignore it - faith in another answer or not.

So that's my position: for all the flack we give Christians about their members who aren't even sure what they believe - but by God they'll vote for it! - I don't think we'll be in much better of a position ourselves just because we're Atheists.

The issue I have about the nature of reality is that there does, in fact, appear to be a reality.

I guess my question boils down to the question of initial causality. I can accept Big Bang Theory as an explanation for how the universe began, but the question I have is what predated the Big Bang? My scientific understanding is that there is a perpetual system of Big Bang/Big Crunch of the universe extending infinitely into the past and the future, but my question is why? Or how did all that begin?

The atheist argument that I've heard here is ""The Universe extends infinitely into the past and future in a series of expansions and contractions."" My response is, ""I can get that, but why does the universe exist? How did this system of expansion/contraction come into initial being, and why does it work in that way?"" The atheist's response to that tends to be, ""It just does.""

I hope this question was coherent.

Another redditor suggested on a previous post of mine that I sort  of hash out all my ""beliefs"" here in order for all you wonderful people to give me advice, your POV, stories, and any other counsel you might think would help me out. So here you have it:**


* I was raised in a non-practicing household, with my mother being Catholic but largely unassociated (her mother, however, is pretty devout) and my father being a very reformed Jew. I was technically raised Jewish, as I went to Hebrew school for a number of years and was bat mitzvahed, but never felt any attachment to either religion, and know I never will.

* God is a pretty tricky subject for me. I don't completely reject the idea of ""higher powers that be,"" but the idea of a figure who created the whole universe and my life and whatever, is total nonsense to me. I openly cringe when people refer to God as ""He"", because 1) God is not a person, it seems almost too informal to refer to God that way (although that's obviously why it's capitalized, but nonetheless) and 2) giving a figure like that gender also kills me. It just doesn't seem right.

* I've never found any need for an abstract figure like ""God"" to guide me or do whatever it is that God supposedly does (see, I really know nothing about religion), so I get confused fairly easily whenever it comes up. So I guess you could say I don't believe in the conventional sense of God, to the extent that I've learned about it in Hebrew school/the bit of church I've attended, but am open to learning about others. For instance, the Greeks gods fascinate, as well as figures like Buddha, who seem to represent more of a lifestyle and guidance than a belief practice.
*Prayer is a lovely concept to me, but in practice, I'm not sure I really believe in it for myself, mainly because I don't find I have anyone/thing to whom I would pray. 

* I've never called myself an atheist, because, still being young, I don't want to just outright reject every religion &amp; their associations, because I feel like someday, maybe, I could accept one. EDIT: Not the best wording. I personally feel like just slapping on the label atheist would stop me from seeking out other religions. So, I'm not opposed to it at all, but I don't want it just yet.

* I find both devout and non-believing/atheistic people equally interesting and would love to hear any and all feedback from all ranges. I love listening to both stories about what God/religion has done for people, as well as how atheism has set them free. It's fascinating to me.

As much as I don't agree with this user's views, and somewhat dishonest debate etiquette, downvoting them for that is very poor taste.

It seems the subscribers of this subreddit have forgotten the purpose of downvoting. The downvote button is not meant to show you disagree with someone. Downvoting means you don't want others to see this post, or the responses to it. This means the only posts that should be downvoted are those that don't contribute to discussion. Even posts with rampant dishonesty should be seen, so it can serve as an example.

Ask yourself, is that really what you want? Do you not want someone to see that atheism has valid answers to its criticisms? What sort of message is that going to send?

Furthermore, by downvoting a disagreeing view you are punishing people for coming here to express one. This means they're likely never to come back. Any lurking theists will see this subreddit as hostile, and never choose to join in. What is the purpose of a debate subreddit if there's no one to debate alternative views?

I would be happy to keep the downvote button if it were used appropriately: Only downvoting posts that don't contribute to meaningful discussion. But, I don't think that's going to happen. I think the best course of action is to simply remove the option to downvote, and if a post doesn't contribute just don't upvote, and inform the poster via comment.

I hope you are doing well. Let us debate, shall we?

 As atheists, I'm sure many of you have been accused of not having sufficient reasons for behaving morally. Some theists even make it sound like threats of eternal punishment are the only thing that could motivate someone to be good. This of course is going a bit too far, but everyone can agree that eternal punishment *could* serve as a good, non-arbitrary reason to behave morally.

 At the end of my post here I am going to ask: On what foundations can the atheist ground their morality, and are those foundations logically sound? So please, think about what your answer to this question is going to be. But before I get there I would like to outline a few assumptions that I think the atheist would agree upon:

1. There is no supernatural dimension to reality, and human beings are composed of material substances, without a soul. 

2. Human beings are the result of evolution by natural selection. They are the result of a long history of random mutations and selection pressures.

3. The human brain has been just one more product of natural selection, and all of the hard-wired cognitive faculties (including morality) are just one more cognitive bias that happened to be adaptive for pre-hominid individual or group survival. 

4. Some portion of human cognition is the result of shaping by our environment. Some moral judgments may be the result of whatever culture we are born into. 

5. All moral feelings are the result of some mixture of 3 &amp; 4.

 Now, if there is no supernatural Right &amp; Wrong, then we must look elsewhere for the source of it. As I have tried to outline above, I think the atheist is committed to claiming that the source of morality lies in our evolutionary history and particular cultural upbringing. But the problem, as I see it, is that neither 3 or 4 offer any non-arbitrary reason for being good or bad. I shall offer an example.

 Incest is universally looked upon with disgust among all cultures in the world. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary point of view. Incest was mal-adaptive, and eventually we have inherited a repugnance towards it. Not because there was anything morally wrong about it. Not for any cosmic injustice. We tend to think it morally bad because some nucleotides copied themselves somewhere. Is that a good reason to say that incest is morally bad? Had dominant and recessive genes behaved differently, or had we some other molecular history, we might be here on reddit claiming that incest was the height of moral good.

 Similarly, had we grown up in a warrior society, we would have much different thoughts on many moral subjects. I believe that the military has some training videos that they regularly employ for just this purpose. I do not think that our moral plasticity is unlimited, but only because we have a genetic component as well.

 In summary: Atheist morality is either the result of some arbitrary evolutionary history, or some arbitrary cultural conditioning. In either case, I am do not see how there could possibly be any good foundations for morality. I will always agree that there are practical reasons. I will always agree that if we want society to continue, we need to pretend these rules are sacred. I will agree that moral feelings are conducive to promoting the happiness of others. But why should I care about any of those things? The theist says ""I care about those things because of God"". Is the atheist forced to say ""I care about those things because I am biologically and environmentally programmed to do so""?

The picture in question: http://imgur.com/DzXNq

***Him***: A bit out of context I'd say.

***Me***: And what exactly is the context here?

***Him***: The context here is made to look like this quote from Ephesians supports slavery, as in the slave trade. That version of the quote is taken from a modern version Bible called the New Living Translation published in 2007. The original quote as translated in the King James Bible (the first English bible over 400 years old) reads, ""Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"" ""Servant"" in the original King James translation context refers to an employee who is paid for his/her service. It suggests that one should commit to working earnestly and whole heartily for his employer as one of faith would work to please God.

***Me***:  The King James version is a notoriously bad translation, as it's original intention was to be beautfiul prose and not completely accurate. The New Living Translation is actually more accurate, as it was intended to convey the actual meaning from the original Hebrew and Greek texts as accurately as possible. In fact, most biblical scholars agree that ""servant"" in the KJV refers to slave, and *not* an employee, well, the non-apologist ones at least. It is a complete mis-translation. So, in this particular verse the term slave is totally correct.

Also, in Exodus 21:21-6, the meaning of servant (KJV) is clearly synonymous to slave, in other translations they are much more upfront and just use the word slave. Not to mention the provisions for sex-slavery in 21:7-11. In Leviticus 25:44-46, it makes it very clear that people can be bought and sold as property, in so much that they are inherited by children when their parents die. Exodus 21:20-21 is also pretty clear that if you beat your slave, and he doesn't die, it's a.ok because he is your property.

***Him***:  Not sure I have the energy to share an opinion on your whole response. I will say that if one reads all of Eph:6 it does also address children to parents and parents to children as well as servant to master and master to servant. It certainly does not support in that final statement about master to servant (slave) that abuse is acceptable. So I guess we can agree, that if you are correct about Exodus and Leviticus, then the photo we're both commenting on could more effectively quote the scripture you refer to and not Ephesians which here is taken out of context.

***Me***: Exodus 21:20-21 “Anyone who beats their male or female slave with a rod must be punished if the slave dies as a direct result, 21 but they are not to be punished if the slave recovers after a day or two, since the slave is their property.""

How does this *not* say anything but, it's ok to beat your slaves if they don't die because they belong to you. In what context would an ""employer"" beating their employee be ok? Why would an all-good, all knowing, eternal god give laws to humans (as is the case in Leviticus and Exodus) regulating slavery instead of condemning it? Why would Jesus use parables with metaphores of slaves being beaten by their master (in Luke 12, 44-47 I believe) and not take the opportunity to be like ""Yo guys, God says owning people as property is wrong"". The bible does not condemn slavery anywhere in the Bible, and constantly makes references to slaves being property. Even Paul was ok with it, in his Epistle to Titus. Given provisions from God himself, he clearly didn't have a problem with it. So maybe Ephesians is out of context, we can agree to disagree here, but the meaning of the picture is still right.

And let's be honest, slavery is not the worst thing that the Bible condones.

***Him***:  The argument is not weather the Bible Condones anything. Its weather God does. We're also reading texts that are thousands of years old and take place in an era where social benefits, human rights and equality did not exist.

Slaves, bond-servants, servants, employees...no matter what you called them were protected only by the integrity of masters.

The circumstances of how those slaves were acquired, are numerous. Some through war, some stolen from Thier lands and held prisoner and others victims of circumstance and unable to survive without food and shelter.

So Righteous men, wrote guidelines on these matters, which those of faith believe are inspired by God. As for in his eyes, all are equal regardless I social status.

Sex slave? No, a slave who a master has had sex with. Does not suggest rape, slavery for that purpose, not does it suggest there was consent. What it does say, is that in the instance that does happen, this is your duty. Just like beating or killing a slave, you have an obligation and as per the scriptures below, you the master will be punished.

""If a man strikes his male or female slave with a rod and he dies at his hand, he shall be punished."" (Exodus 21:20)
""If a man strikes the eye of his male or female slave, and destroys it, he shall let him go free on account of his eye. ""And if he knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, he shall let him go free on account of his tooth."" (Exodus 21:26-27)
""He who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be put to death."" (Exodus 21:12)
""Six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease from labor so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female slave, as well as your stranger, may refresh themselves. (Exodus 23:12)
Do not slander a slave to his master, Or he will curse you and you will be found guilty. (Proverbs 30:10)
'Now if a man lies carnally with a woman who is a slave acquired for another man, but who has in no way been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment; they shall not, however, be put to death, because she was not free. (Leviticus 19:20)
""You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. (Deuteronomy 23:15)
'If a countryman of yours becomes so poor with regard to you that he sells himself to you, you shall not subject him to a slave's service. 'He shall be with you as a hired man, as if he were a sojourner; he shall serve with you until the year of jubilee. 'He shall then go out from you, he and his sons with him, and shall go back to his family, that he may return to the property of his forefathers. 'For they are My servants whom I brought out from the land of Egypt; they are not to be sold in a slave sale. 'You shall not rule over him with severity, but are to revere your God. (Leviticus 25:39-43)
""If you buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve for six years; but on the seventh he shall go out as a free man without payment."" (Exodus 21:2)
He who pampers his slave from childhood Will in the end find him to be a son. (Proverbs 29:21)

You know your stuff bud, I like it.

***Me***: Sorry the late reply, working all day then my friends 21st right after so I wasn't at my computer.

I would think that weather the Bible condones slavery is synonymous with whether God condones it. Why would God inspire righteous men to write books, then allow them to write things he does not agree with in Holy Scripture? The laws in Exodus and Leviticus are supposedly dictated to Moses by YHWH directly. It's absolutely ridiculous to claim that the Bible would have anything in it that God does not agree with; unless you were to say that God would not prevent men from corrupting the text. Then you should probably convert to Islam because that is exactly what they claim and that would mean they would be right -- given that YHWH/Allah even exists in the firstplace. I also agree with you 100% about the social/economic context about the time the Bible was written; so why should we care what anything in it says? There isn't any value unique to the Bible that isn't available from other sources, and given all the violence, misygony, racism, etc... in it, it's better to simply disregard it altogether as a source of moral guidance. We've evolved way passed it as a species and it's crazy that people in 2012 still cling to a book of iron-age fairy tales to guide their lives.

Slaves, bond-servants, whatever you want to call them, being protected only by the integrity of their masters is the entire point. They are subjugated to the will of another person. How and when they were acquired is completely irrelevant. Like I said before, if these men were supposedly inspired by God, and God doesn't approve of slavery why would he not just be like ""Yo guys, owning people as property as wrong"". Instead, we get rules and regulations, infering approval. It doesn't matter if masters get punished for mistreating their slaves, they are still provisions that make slavery a.ok as long as you follow them. If social benefits, human rights and equality did not exist yet then it should be the responsibilty of an eternal, all-known, all-loving deity to give them. It's absolutely ridiculous to claim that God would give them laws based on their social-economic context and not his own morality, the entire point of divine law is to supercede that of man.

God should ""inspired"" these so-called righteous men to not have slaves in the first place.

Sex-slave vs ""slave who a master has had sex with"", those are synonymous. The term sex-slave does not imply mutual exclusivity. I don't see how it's relevant either, it's still subjecting the freedom of one to the will of the other and condones buying and selling women as property. Misogyny and slavery double-whammy. Just because you get punished for breaking some arbitrary rule doesn't change the fact that the Bible condones treating people like property.

Regarding the wall of scripture:

Exodus 21:20 - You're forgetting the verse *immediately after* that says that if he survives, it's ok to beat them because the slave is your *property*. Weren't we just talking about taking verses out of context?

Exodus 21:26-27 -- Probably the only defensible provision in the entire lot though it is strange to put emphasis on just the eyes and teeth. Then again, none of the laws ever say not to beat slaves in the first place, wouldn't that be a much better provision?

Exodus 21:12 -- Basic thou-shalt-not kill stuff, not relevant to the slavery and not exclusive to judeo-christian dogma. Moving on.

Exodus 23:12 -- Oh how nice, slaves get a day off. That makes up for everything else...

Proverbs 30:10 -- Oh no, I wouldn't want to be cursed! What does this even mean, and what is the punishment? This is just random poetry, and doesn't seem to have any relevance to The Law.

Leviticus 19:20 -- This is a strange verse, I must admit, and seems deliberately vague (as is most of the Bible, this just more so). One question I would ask is does this work when a girl is raped? If she is, and she's a virgin, do we follow Deutoronomy 22:28-29 and force her to marry her rapist instead of the man she is engaged to? Should also go great with Deuteronomy 22: 13-21, where we stone girls to death that aren't virgins on their wedding night.

Deuteronomy 23:15 -- Well that's nice, then again people shouldn't be slaves and have to escape from masters in the first place. Why is God making such weird ass rules instead of just telling them to not have slaves?!

Leviticus 25:39-43 -- Oh, so slave and servent *are* different things now. Since we're talking about slaves, I don't really see the point in discussing this.

Exodus 21:2 -- So here's a thought experiment: Let's assume God doesn't approve of slavery (that is your claim, after all). God is dictating his law to Moses. Then this comes up, instead of saying ""Yo Moses, you shouldn't treat people as property"" he says ""If you buy slaves, it's only for 6 years"". Sound logic right there. Also, weren't the Hebrews God's chosen people? It seems odd to allow them to become slaves, especially to eachother.

Proverbs 29:21 -- Seems to be a mistranslation actually. My NIV says ""will turn out to be insolent"". Other translations I've looked up on-line agree mostly, and the ones that use the term ""son"" use it meaning ""expecting the rights of a son"". So this verse seems to actually be saying ""don't pamper them, or they'll turn out to be spoiled assholes"". Also, just more random poetry.

At this point, I think I would rather leave the discussion here. For Kristin's sake (polluting her wall), and this is getting rather protracted. I don't really feel like disecting any more scripture either, I feel my point has been made crystal clear. I do appreciate the mature exchange of ideas though, most people I discuss religion with that are on the other side usually devolves very quickly.

I've been having somewhat of an identity crisis. I was raised Protestant but pretty mildly at that; didn't go to church more than say once every month if that. Quick prayer at dinner. Anyways, my dad dying last month has made me question my faith. If you'd be kind of enough, share your view with me on these points
1.) I do believe in God, I'm just not sure of his nature. I'm leaning strongly towards a belief in an entity that set things in motion, but i'm not so sure he/she it is the benevolent god the bible speaks of, let alone that he intervenes at all.
2.) Assuming i am correct in statement #1, what is the crime in believing in the supernatural? Any beings technologically advanced enough could seem to have a supernatural or heavenly nature.
3.) Are other plane's of existence or an afterlife THAT far fetched? I don't think we have the technology to make a reasonable observation in either direction. 
4.) I believe in evolution, but i don't think evolution and creationism are mutually exclusive. If some celestial being seeded life on earth, it wouldn't have to start with a full grown human. couldn't it have simply planted basic genetic seeds that would adapt to Earth's environment over time? 
-I know that was long, but i guess it all boils down to the fact that I'm not sure of anything anymore. I'm not ready to accept the 'there is no god, no supernatural' outlook, but i definitely refuse to accept the idea of a 'benevolent' god that constantly interferes with our lives. any and all input would be great :-/",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_rgff7,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/rgff7/help_a_skeptical_christian_debate_himself/,

---

This is a reply to a FB friend as a part of an ongoing discussion we are having. And [me] - I am sincerely sorry for how long this took. I've been dealing with a lot and this kept being relegated to the background!

There are a number of preliminary considerations that must be laid in order to adequately answer your question. Your question, if I may ‘boil it down’ appears to me to be as follows: “Given that the Bible appears to, both in what it proscribes and describes, contradict the ethic of modern Christianity, how can it be said to be the foundation for Christian ethics?” While that’s a good question that needs to be answered, I don’t think it gets to the heart of our debate. So what I’d like to do is broaden the scope of the question I seek to answer, and in so doing I hope I will answer the question above. The question I want to answer is, “How does Christianity account for a transcendent morality?” You are right in your instincts that, “The Bible says so” is not a sufficient answer to that question, though in fairness, no one who has given the subject much thought argues for that.
 
 Before I begin, I wish to define what I am *not* arguing, because you’ve raised each of these points:

1) I am not arguing that assent to the Lordship of God is necessary for humans to know what moral behavior is, or for them to act in ways that are in line with morality. In other words, you don’t have to be a Christian to do good things. Indeed, it is essential to my argument that all men have an understanding of a transcendent standard of right and wrong and act in ways that reflects their knowledge of this standard. 
 
2) I am not arguing that an individual can ever arrive at an absolute, comprehensive knowledge of morality – i.e. that an individual person can ever know in any possible situation what the ‘right’ choice is. There is a difference between absolute knowledge, and knowledge of an absolute. As you have said repeatedly, there are situation where the right thing is obvious, and others where the answer is a little more difficult to see and we must use careful reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.
 
3) I am not arguing that the Bible is a comprehensive moral guide in that it removes the necessity for humans to engage in moral reasoning, or that doing what is right is simply a matter of, “doing what the Bible says.” As I will argue later, the Bible is an essential component of right moral reasoning, but it is not “How to be a Good Person for Dummies” by the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Bible is a sufficient and true moral guide, but it does not address every moral contingency.
 
So if a Christian understanding of morality does not start with, “The Bible says so”, where does it start? Well, the most important thing is that it does not start with man as an independent self-governing creature. John Locke, one of the fathers of empiricism, articulated the idea that an infant is a *Tabula Rasa* – or a blank slate. He explained that all of our morals, values and principles are ‘written’ on the blank slate by culture, upbringing, experience, and other factors, through our sensory experience. I think that this is more or less the way most people nowadays think. Christianity rejects this notion of man as a blank slate. Instead, God has created humans in a certain way, and thus every person bears that divine stamp upon his being. People are not simply taught to reason, communicate, build and love – they do those things because it is in their nature and is a reflection of how God made them. Upbringing, culture, and experience certainly do shape and even define who a person is and how they think, but they can’t explain the categories we seem to be born with. For instance, I was taught English, but the concept of communication did not have to be taught. I was taught rules of logic, but I didn’t have to be taught to reason or ask questions – it just comes naturally. So Christianity teaches that there are certain things that are intrinsic t man’s nature because of the way God has created man.
 
Narrowing this to the area of our discussion, the reason people have a generally homogeneous view of morality is because, first of all, we have all been created by the same God with the same understanding of morality. Secondly, Christianity teaches that this knowledge is of a real thing. That is, we feel and act as if there is real right and wrong in the world, and indeed there is a real right and wrong in the world that corresponds to our knowledge. God has created us in such a way that we recognize the morality that exists. 
 
One does not need to argue to the vast majority of people that eating a baby for dinner is wrong. We *just* know that it is wrong. That much you and I agree upon. Even in the cases where someone grossly violates the sense of morality that has been given to us – the Holocaust or something – they seek to justify their actions in such a way that it doesn’t violate that moral code. When someone is defending a murder, they don’t simply say, “It doesn’t matter,” – they will seek to explain how in their particular case it was acceptable or right. Of course, the particulars vary from culture to culture – they may have differing notions of what constitutes murder, for instance – but no society exist in which murder is good and taking care of people is wrong. So whether we want to argue about if God put that knowledge there, or evolutionary processes, we agree on the first part – people have a generally consensual view of morality that we view as generally binding on each member of the human race. We disagree about the particulars and the application, but except in the case of those with severe mental issues, everyone believes it is wrong to kill a man for fun, and right to help him when he is in trouble.
 
It’s this second part that causes all the difficulties for any non-theistic position. It is perfectly consistent within a Christian worldview for God to have moral standards and to impart the knowledge of those standards. Our understanding of morality, or “conscience” is useful because it helps us understand how the world was ordered and ought to be, and is binding and obligatory because it relates to actual duties and obligations that we actually have as subjects of the moral order God has created us to exist in. The atheist on the other hand has to explain that our morals are a result of genetic and cultural evolution. However, they have great difficulty in explaining how these genetic and cultural developments translate into duty or obligation once we are aware that they are genetic and cultural developments. There may be a benefit to the species as a whole, but even this concept is lacking because benefit for the species =/= moral obligation. Indeed, certain things that might be beneficial for the species as a whole, from a survival perspective, are things we recognize to be wrong, such as killing mentally retarded people. But a critique of atheistic ethics is not possible in length, so I will leave it at that for now.
 
So the first part of a Christian understanding of ethics is that all people have a basic knowledge of right and wrong, and that this knowledge is intrinsic to human beings. Of course, this understanding varies from person to person, and develops as a person gets older. The Bible is not even necessary at this point. We don’t need the Bible to tell us that murder is wrong – it’s part of the law of God that is written on our hearts. The Bible itself makes that argument, when it says “For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.” (Rom 2:14 ESV) Even the people without the Mosaic law understand the moral precepts commanded by them, and this demonstrates that they know God’s law even though they are without the written word of God.
 
So – why do we need the Bible? Well, there are a number of things to be said on this point. The first is that as we have seen, the Bible is not necessary for us to understand that there is a right and wrong. We know that independently from the Bible – if we didn’t, then it would be rather absurd to say that God can justly punish those who have been given a standard by which they can be judged. The Bible is many things, but if I can simplify greatly, the main thing that the Bible is about is God, which by extension tells us about man. That might seem like an obvious answer but it is important because many people, Christians and non-Christians alike, approach the Bible as if it is a rule book that, when followed, helps us be good people. Instead, the main (but not exclusive) point of the Bible is to reveal God – or tell us who he is and what he has done. As I already discussed there are certain elements, such as an understanding of morality and a knowledge of God as creator that are understood innately (people can and do suppress this knowledge, so it is definitely something that all people *accept*) But certain things, such as God’s interactions with his creation, his saving work through Jesus Christ, and the fact that he exists as a Trinity, can only be known if God reveals these things to us. Obviously, there is much more to be said on this point, but my basic point is that we oughtn’t look on the Bible as an ethics handbook, but the further self-revelation of God – creation and the created order being the other place he has revealed himself.
 
Perhaps the most important aspect of God’s self-revelation, as it relates to ethics, is his lordship over his creation. What that means is, to put it in un-philosophical terms, he is the boss and he gets to make the rules. Again, you can mock this idea as primitive and not befitting modern man, but if God exists, it is not inconsistent to say that he is Lord. A necessary fact that proceeds from God's lordship, both logically and biblically, is that his actions cannot be judged by his creatures. His moral will is revealed through the created order, our consciences, and even more explicitly in the Bible. So, you can see that a Christian understanding of morality is not a simply of matter of asking, “What is the rule that applies to this situation?”
 
So, now that I have hopefully explained how a Christian understands ethics and morality and accounts for a transcendent law, let me interact with your claim that the Bible is a flawed moral compass. You made some vague assertions or allusions, but not all the supposed examples of flawed morality are comparable or can be answered in the same way. Your basic argument was that the Bible presents an inconsistent foundation for ethical reasoning. So, as I see it, there are three different areas where critics assert the Bible is flawed or inconsistent, and I will briefly address all three.
 
First, there is a difference between the 'descriptive' and the 'proscriptive' in the Bible.  The 'proscriptive' is that which God tells his people to do – specific revelations that are to guide their actions. There is also a large 'descriptive' portion of Scripture that simply narrates things that happened. Christians have never, ever, ever, approached Scripture with a “If it's in the Bible it's OK!” attitude. The Bible describes some pretty wicked actions while at the same time providing the basis for condemning those actions. This point seems so obvious, but apparently people somehow think, for example, the Bible is endorsing rape simply because it describes rape. So that takes care of a great number of the 'moral' objections against the Bible – which, incidentally, are made by people who are getting their info from second-hand sources. It's amazing how quickly objections against the Bible disappear when you ask for chapter and verse. The Bible is an amazingly complex and complicated book, and attempts to reduce it to a simple, monolithic work are not intellectually honest.
 
Secondly, there is the issue of the change of covenant, as you brought up. Christianity does recognize that certain aspects of the Old Testament (OT) law are not applicable to Christians today. However, this is not some doctrine the Church came up with later in order to be able to ignore the commandments we were embarrassed by in order to come up with a system we felt more comfortable with – sort of like Einstein's infamous, arbitrary 'fudge factor' which he inserted into his theory to produce the result he felt more comfortable with. The difference between the OT and NT is that God's people in the OT were identified with a particular national group (Israel), and they had a particular penal code. Now agree or disagree with it, the point is that certain commandments were particularly suited to that nation, in that time and place. It's easy to make certain laws out to be stupid or barbaric, but intellectual honesty requires us to inform ourselves of the historical realities of the time. Of course, I don't have time to go through every possible objection, but I'll give one example.
 For instance, the law requires that a rebellious son be stoned to death. So atheists will take this and say to Christians, “Oh, well, here's my 10 year old son and he won't clean up his room. Should we kill him?” Well, in reality, this wasn't a matter of parents being able to arbitrarily murder their children, but a matter of national security and identity. The society at the time was highly patriarchal and cohesive, and fathers were the national leaders – so when an (adult) son publicly defied and rebelled against his father, it was not simply a matter of growing his hair out and listening to punk rock. He was attacking the very authority structure of his society. Back then, a nation without strong identity and cohesiveness would be destroyed by its neighbours. Furthermore, the parents couldn't simply carry this sentence out arbitrarily. Both parents had to bring the charge to the authorities, and witnesses had to be summoned. It was tried before a panel of judges, and if the guilt was established, the entire NATION would carry out the sentence. The penal code was thus partially instituted to ensure the cohesiveness and survival of the nation. So part of the reason we don't follow those laws now is because we are no longer a nation living in that particular time, under those particular circumstances.
 
What I don't want to do, though, is perpetuate the notion that the underlying moral principles that underlay the commandments of the OT have somehow passed away in the NT. For instance, the idea behind the prohibition of tattooing and mutilation of flesh in Leviticus was because the Israelites were supposed to be separate unto God, and tattooing and mutilation were facets of the pagan religions surrounding them. That is no longer the case, but the principle of being separate  unto God is still affirmed in the NT. We no longer stone homosexuals or adulterers because the church does not have the legal authority to do so because we do not live in a theocracy, but that does not mean adultery is now endorsed. But neither does that mean that it was wrong for the theocratic state of Israel to carry out those sentences – it's just that we need to live in a historical awareness of the circumstances when reading the Bible (an awareness which the Bible provides, I might add.) Many of the laws (like seafood, tattoos, mixing of cloth, etc...) were dealing with particular features of society and surrounding religions at the time, and since those particulars have passed away, the laws can seem quaint. The underlying moral principle remains, however, and thus we see what those laws were teaching us without having to adhere to the particular way they were applied in an ancient context.

Nor should the New Testament (NT) be construed as a shift in morality. As I have already stated, the Bible is not primarily an ethics handbook. Thus the law was not primarily a bunch of rules to follow; in fact, the NT repeatedly states that the whole point of the law was to serve as a schoolmaster pointing us to the fact that it was utterly IMPOSSIBLE to attain to God's holy standards. The NT is not a relaxation of the standards of the OT, it makes them even MORE difficult to follow so that we will understand we cannot follow them perfectly. Jesus' Sermon on the Mount is the most famous example of this. The point of both the law in the OT and the NT is to set God's holy standards in front of his people so that they understand their sin and rely on God for forgiveness of those sins and the ability and desire to follow after him.
 
There was a third part of your objection, and those have to do with the supposed 'genocides' and immoral actions that came either directly or indirectly from the hand of God. Again, it's easy to set up the spectre of a bloodthirsty, malevolent God. Unfortunately, there are some who call themselves Christians who perpetuate this image of God as being mean and nasty in the OT, but nice and gentle in the NT. Well, the Bible is not a children's storybook and the reality is a bit more complicated than that. If you take God's actions out of the context of the rest of the Bible, sure, you can portray him as a bloodthirsty monster. But put into the balance of the rest of Scripture, this caricature cannot stand. As I've already stated, the fundamental idea of Scripture is that God is Lord. One of the things that attends his lordship is his authority to act as supreme Judge. When the Bible portrays God as angry or 'covered in the blood of his enemies', (which it does in both OT and NT) it does so in the context of God as Judge. God is not simply kicking the backside of some unfortunate victim because he's had a bad day. When God wiped out the entire human race but 8 in the flood, it was because they were wicked beyond imagination and were deserving of the penalty God imposed. We don't refer to the act of killing Nazis after the Neurenburg trials an act of barbarity - we call it justice. And as God is the perfect Judge with knowledge of all things, his judgment is always right. Nor is the judgment passed without warning or knowledge of God's requirements – in the instance of the Great Flood, God waited over 140 years to give the people a chance to change.
 
The Bible actually doesn't really see it as a problem that God kills people; the real theological problem is that God hasn't simply wiped us all out. Throughout the Bible, we see the justice of God mixed with his mercy. He offers a chance to repent, a way to be reconciled, until ultimately, Jesus Christ takes the full punishment for all who will repent of their rebellion and trust him as Lord. Those who continue to take his patience for granted will not always enjoy his patience; justice is waiting for them.  The important thing with all this is that God has reserved this right to judge in this way for himself alone. The Bible is pretty clear that people do not have the right to arbitrarily do God's work for him – for the very reason that we are all equally condemned under his law. There is certain authority vested to governments by God to govern the affairs of nations and to carry out justice as far as it relates to human relationships, but the judgment of nations and individuals (and ability to carry out his sentence) belongs to God alone.
 
Obviously, I have to simplify things greatly, taking what the Bible says over 66 books and a few thousand years in a few paragraphs – but that is the jist of my explanation of the Bible's ethics and how it can serve as a consistent moral compass. The Bible is not a 'moral code' as much as a (binding) moral guide, insofar as it reveals God as our creator and us as his creation, and the moral relationship that exists there.
 
So, in conclusion, I think that these three answers sufficiently put to rest your accusation that the Bible is internally inconsistent and thus an unreliable moral guide. Of course, each of these answers could be further explored and substantiated in particular cases, but this is my general defence. The moral compass of the Bible is in fact consistent with itself, from beginning to end. Of course, if one insists on approaching the Bible with the mindset of a twelve-year old, yes, it can seem to say some silly things. However, the ignorance of some need not prohibit the rest of us from approaching it like adults and seeing that while complex and spanning a vast amount of history, the Bible's message is remarkably consistent. I'm not saying that an adult will automatically (or ever) accept the Bible's claims for itself, but at the very least, accept that it can't be dismissed off-handedly as 'a collection of old myths' or 'superstitious nonsense.' Deal with what Christians actually say, and what the Bible actually says, rather than what you WANT the Bible to say, or Christians to say, so that it's easy to make fun of. Christianity, both past and present, is full of people who seek to be intellectually honest and ask the same questions that you do.

Also, please realize I already know you dislike the morality of the Bible. I wasn’t trying to make it palatable for you. I am responding to your claim that the Bible is a flawed moral compass. Disliking where the Bible is pointing is not the same thing as showing that it is broken.

This is not my original work, but something I read by Peter Kreeft. (Also, for reference: [Dating the New Testament](http://www.errantskeptics.org/DatingNT.htm))

**I. Proof that the Gospels were written by eyewitnesses**

*A. Internal Evidence, from the Gospels themselves*

1. The style of writing in the Gospels is simple and alive, what we would expect from their traditionally accepted authors.
2. Moreover, since Luke was written before Acts, and since Acts was written prior to the death of Paul, Luke must have an early date, which speaks for its authenticity.
3. The Gospels also show an intimate knowledge of Jerusalem prior to its destruction in A.D. 70…. The Gospels are full of proper names, dates, cultural details, historical events, and customs and opinions of that time.
4. Jesus’ prophecies of the destruction of Jerusalem must have been written prior to Jerusalem’s fall, for otherwise the church would have separated out the apocalyptic element in the prophecies, which makes them appear to concern the end of the world. Since the end of the world did not come about when Jerusalem was destroyed, the so-called prophecies of its destruction that were really written after the city was destroyed would not have made that event appear so closely connected with the end of the world. Hence the Gospels must have been written prior to A.D. 70.
5. The stories of Jesus’ human weaknesses and of the disciples’ faults also bespeak of the Gospels’ accuracy.
6. Furthermore, it would have been impossible for forgers to put together so consistent a narrative as that which we find in the Gospels. The Gospels do not try to suppress apparent discrepancies, which indicates their originality (written by eyewitnesses). There is no attempt at harmonization between the Gospels, such as we might expect from forgers. 
7. The Gospels do not contain anachronisms; the authors appear to have been first-century Jews who were witnesses of the events.

We may conclude that there is no more reason to doubt that the Gospels come from the traditional authors than there is to doubt that the works of Philo or Josephus are authentic, *except* that the Gospels contain supernatural events.

*B. External Evidence*

1. The disciples must have left *some* writings, engaged as they were in giving lessons to and counseling believers who were geographically distant; and what could these writings be if not the Gospels and epistles themselves? Eventually the apostles would have needed to publish accurate narratives of Jesus’ history, so that any spurious attempts would be discredited and the genuine Gospels preserved.
2. There were many eyewitnesses who were still alive when the books were written who could testify whether they came from their purported authors or not.
3. The extra-biblical testimony unanimously attributes the Gospels to their traditional authors, testimony from the Epistle of Barnabas, the Epistle of Clement, the Shepherd of Hermas, all the way up to Eusebius in A.D. 315… Theophilus, Hippolytus, Origen, Quadratus, Irenaeus, Melito, Polycarp, Justin Martyr, Dionysius, Tertullian, Cyprian, Tatian, Caius, Athanasius, Cyril, Even Christianity’s opponents conceded this: Celsus, Porphyry, Emperor Julian.
4. With a single exception, no apocryphal gospel is ever even quoted by any known author during the first three hundred years after Christ. In fact there is no evidence that any inauthentic gospel whatever existed in the first century, in which all four Gospels and Acts were written.

**II. Proof that the Gospels we have today are the same Gospels originally written**

A.	because of the need for instruction and personal devotion, these writings must been copied many times, which increases the chances of preserving the original text.

B.	In fact, no other ancient work is available in so many copies and languages, and yet all these various versions agree in content.

C.	The text has also remained unmarred by heretical additions. The abundance of manuscripts over a wide geographical distribution demonstrates that the text was transmitted with only trifling discrepancies. The differences that do exist are quite minor and are the result of unintentional mistakes. 

D.	The quotations of the New Testament books in the early church Fathers all coincide.

E.	The Gospels could not have been corrupted without a great outcry on the part of all orthodox Christians.

F.	No one could have corrupted *all* the manuscripts.

G.	There is no precise time when the falsification would have occurred, since, as we have seen, the New Testament books are cited by the Church Fathers in regular and close succession. The text could not have been falsified before all external testimony, since then the apostles were alive and could repudiate such tampering.

H.	The text of the New Testament is every bit as good as the text of the classical works of antiquity… To repudiate the textual parity of the Gospels would be to reverse all the rules of criticism and to reject all the works of antiquity, since the text of those works is less certain that that of the Gospels. 

Thank you for the taking the time to read through. My hope is to have open, honest dialogue.

TL;DR Richard Purtill summarizes the textual case:

&gt; Many events which are regarded as firmly established historically have (1) far less documentary evidence than many biblical events, (2) and the documents on which historians rely for much secular history are written much longer after the event than many records of biblical events. (3) Furthermore, we have many more copies of biblical narratives than of secular histories, and (4) the surviving copies are much earlier than those on which our evidence for secular history is based. If the biblical narratives did not contain accounts for miraculous events… biblical history would probably be regarded as much more firmly established than most of the history of, say, classical Greece and Rome.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_pb6tt,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/pb6tt/can_i_get_your_thoughts_regarding_the_new/,
1326143796.0,16,self.DebateAnAtheist,o9sue,Counterpoints to TheoreticalBullshit's structure of the Kalam argument to prove God does not exist.,I3lindman,24,8,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/o9sue/counterpoints_to_theoreticalbullshits_structure/,"[Here is a video posted by youtube user TheoreticalBullshit, constructing a variation of the Kalam argument to conclude that God does not exist.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD9MtIma5YU)   

I submit the following three points in rejection of the argument from the Judeo-Christian perspective:  

1) To start, let's assume that the argument is both rational and logically valid.  I am not conceding that it is, which I will address in points 2 and 3.  In this case, the conclusion drawn is accurate, through the implied conlusion is a strawman.  The argument is limited to stating the first law of thermodynamics (conservation of energy).  For reasons stated in the argument, it does not apply to metaphysical principles, only physical ones.  For example, I have created an idea in the form of this post and the content it contains, which represents a metaphysical object.  This act of creation of a metaphysical object is not relevant to the argument.  Therefor it follows that the argument only serves to determine the existence or non-existence of God in a physical form and bounded by the laws of physics, specifically conservation of energy.  

**The conclusion that God does not exist in a physical form, bounded by the laws of physics, is one any theist of the Judeo-Christian tradition would agree with.  ""God has no body or bodily form.""**  

So on this point, that conclusion that God does not exist is a pseudo-strawman, as it would be more accurately stated, ""God does not exist in a physical form and is not bounded by the laws of physics.""   

2) The construction of the argument is logically invalid as it excludes the universe from beginning to exist utilizing the framework he establishes.  

Using the example that TheoreticalBullshit cites, using his fist to demonstrate that the fist does not begin to exist where it did not before, it simply changed from one form to another establishes the criteria on which to conclude what consititues ""beginning to exist"".  If we utilize this same framework and consider the universe as a whole, we are confronted with this fact:  [There is zero net energy in the universe.](http://www.astrosociety.org/pubs/mercury/31_02/nothing.html)  

As such, it follows that the universe as whole does not meet the criteria established by the fist example for ""beginning to exist"".  Instead, the unvierse is a result of a change in form of what was already present (nothing).  **This is a direct contradiction to the 3rd point of the argument, that ""The universe began to exist"", and therefore the argument is logically invalid.  The criteria established are so strict that nothing can be said to have ""begun to exist"".**  

3) The exclusion of an alteration of physical form as a lack of causality to existence is irrational.  Ignoring the logical violation demonstrated in point #2, few would rationally assert that we do not exist, or that we were not caused by exist.  Even from a strong atheistic view, a male and female engaging in sex with the intent to have a child would qualify as caused existence.  Even more simplistically, simply speaking would rationally qualify as causing a physical phenomena to exist where it did not before.  To compare this with the original argument, the extreme limitation to violation of conservation of energy as being required to warrant causation of existence serves no useful purpose.  

**Simply put, if the complex physical form of a particular human being does not warrant a form of existence distinct from the various chemical compounds that phsyically compose our bodies, then the defintion of existence in that context is functionally useless and therefor rationally useless.**

Hello

Against my better judgement I had a quick look at your rather sad website. Having found an hour to spare before evening worship, I've just spent an entertaining time smiling at some of the responses hat you think are 'well written', I'm surprised that you consider there are "" Easily a dozen or more well written responses that shut down what you said await you"". Well written? Are you and your spotty geeky friends working at some sort of lower levels here?

Let's look at just some of the stuff they stated:

1. ""Appeal to authority, someone is full of themselves. If he wants to play the credentials game he is in bad company. Most of the prominent physicists of today are atheists (Hawking, Mlodinow, Krauss, Greene, Stenger, etc). If he wants to play the illogical game of ""count the experts"" he is going to lose, the only half religious prominent physicist I can think of is Dyson (deist).""

Then this guy hasn't looked far. Look up Prof John Polkinghorne FRS (Anglican) Werner Heisenberg (Lutheran), John Eccles (Catholic), Sir Robert Boyd, Mariano Artigas, C F Von Weizenacher, Alan Sandage, Stanley Jaki (Catholic), Ian Barbour, Prof Russell Stannard, Charles Hard Townes, Antonino Zichichi, Owen Gingerich, Michal Heller, Robert Griffiths, George Ellis, Eric Priest, Joel Primack, John D Barrow, Stephen Barr, Jennifer Wiseman, Jocelyn Bell-Burnell (Quaker), Karl Gibberson, Ard Louis, Pamela Gay and many others. And these are only the physicists I can think of off the top of my head. They don't include chemists, biologists, mathematicians and so on.

It's interesting how the only people who claim """"Appeal to authority, someone is full of themselves"" are those with no authority at all. For ""appealing to authority"" read ""I'm too thick to comment on here, so I'll denigrate someone with some intelligence so it makes me feel better"".
That's why those with NO authority come up with one name, Dyson, who incidentally said this in the review of The God of Hope and the End of the World from John Polkinghorne:

"" I am myself a Christian, a member of a community that preserves an ancient heritage of great literature and great music, provides help and counsel to young and old when they are in trouble, educates children in moral responsibility, and worships God in its own fashion.""

Some deist I think.

2. ""This whole section is an exercise in longwinded red herring.""

No evidence given for this.

3. ""What hundreds of constants? There really aren't all that many unique constants as most of them are the result of other things ""

To quote Wikipedia (something I rarely use, but it serves a purpose here): ""It is known that the Universe would be very different, if these constants took values significantly different from those we observe. For example, a few percent change in the value of the fine structure constant would be enough to eliminate stars like our Sun. This has prompted attempts at anthropic explanations of the values of some of the dimensionless fundamental physical constants.""

Just a few:

Gravitational constant G, atomic mass constant, Avogadro's number, Panck Constant, electron constant e0, Boltzman's Constant, elemental charge e, fine structure constant a, speed of light in vacuo, c, Faraday Constant, Loschmidt Constant, reduced Planck Constant h-bar, magnetic constant, mu, classic electron radius, Wien displacement law constant, Fermi Coupling Constant, Impedance of a vacuul Zo, Hartree Energy, Quantum of circulation, Coulomb's constant ke, Bohn Magneton, muB, conductance quantum Go, Sackur-Tetrode constant, Josephson Constant Kj, Magnetic Flux Quantum, Nuclear Magneton, Rydberg Constant, Thomson Cross Section, First Radiation constant, Weak mixing angle, Von Klitzing constant, fine structure constant, Bohr radius..... like a few more?

""There really aren't all that many unique constants ""??? I, and physicists, beg to differ. And remember these are just a few of the independent constants. 'Derived' constants number MANY more. 

3. ""Yawn. A boring and predictable argument loaded with blinding by science.""

In other words, this person cannot respond. Good tactic but I've seen through it.

4. ""You cannot say that our universe is special, we do not know how many different universes there may be and if variables can be different from universe to universe then getting a set of variables that allow for life is not amazing. ""

Wrong. Can you name ONE piece of irrefutable evidence that is repeatable and verifiable that proves multiverses exist. There is none. All speculation.

5""....... configuration that could possibly lead to life, which is another thing we do not know (sure, if the gravitational constant was larger there would be problems but maybe not if we lived in a four dimensional universe with a different electromagnetic force). ""

The point missed entirely. If constants could change or somehow 'compensate' for each other so that life could exist within a huge range of constant values, this is still no argument. If the universe is a random set of values why should it BOTHER to want to produce conditions necessary for life to exist in the first place.

6. (on the necessity of carbon as a prerequisite for life) ""At this point I'm giving up on this section. This guy rambles too much and just keeps repeating the same kind of crap that has been repeated over and over. ""

Yup. He cannot refute it so he insults. Good try. I suggest that this guy actually address why carbon is the only element in the universe that can produce life and why carbon exists against all odds. Simply dismissing this and calling it 'crap' is a cop-out, and he knows it.

7"" but He continues to attempt to blind by science, and appealing to complexity and alluding to the improbability of the whole thing. We do not know the odds, and we do not know the number of attempts reality has had.""

Wrong. It seems that it is all to easy to blind this person with science if he cannot even address the carbon problem.Moreover we DO know the odds.

8. (Those are the ONLY two alternatives.)""False dichotomy, textbook case of it too. ""

Well, instead of just slinging insult in this one, the proper refutation would be to offer a third alternative, surely? Or a fourth? or fifth? As this pseudo-intelligent ignoramus done this? No. Why not? Because there isn't one, no matter how much blustering is done. And how do I know there isn't one? because if there were someone here, no doubt, would have mentioned it. 

9. (Christians (and Jews and Muslims) have always accepted an 'eternal' God.) ""No they haven't.""

Really? You see, you are accepting some ignorant spotty geek sat in a garret somewhere stating things with NO refutation. The Jewish scriptures all point to an eternal God, YHWH as does the Christian New Testament. If he states 'No they haven't' - where is the evidence for this. There is none of course. 

I find your insistence on MY producing chapter and verse evidence, and then ignoring it, but accepting the garbage written here as two faced, inconsistent and unfair. 

10. ""At light speed, time stops.Another blinding by science red herring.""

Don't blame me for this, blame Einstein. He theorised time dilation, that as one approached the speed of light, time slowed down so that at the speed of light time is frozen. This time dilation was proved as fact originally by measuring mesons and their travel through the atmosphere from space.

11. ""No it doesn't, and rambling on longer than mr timecube does not constitute evidence.""

More insult. Ignored.

12. Fuck these silly goddamn beliefs and shitty illogical arguments.

Nice. Is THIS what you call 'refutation' of my argument? Are you for real? Or are you an idiot? Do you REALLY consider filth like this as 'refutation'??

13 ""I seriously laughed at his dismissal of multiverses. He is basically saying multiverses can't be the answer because we can't test them. Therefore it has to be God.""

Well, can you name ONE repeatable test that has been done that proves multiverses exist? Just one?
And where did I suggest this alone was 'proof' of God? A straw man argument if ever I saw it.

14. He has a point though -- we ARE unjustified in asserting multiverses are the answer, but he is equally unjustified in asserting God is the answer. The correct answer is we simply don't know why the constants are what they are and saying anything else about this is simply speculation.

Absolutely. But we need to look at the probability. The probability of the universe being by chance is almost zero. And if not by chance,, then there must be another reason. What is it? If not chance, the ONLY alternative is design. And if design, then a designer. Youy cannot wriggleout of this fact.

15. ""Take a deck of cards, shuffle it, and note the order. Do it, say, 14 more times, noting the order each time. The probability that this order of 15 decks happened is (1/52!)15, which is equal to about 101018, which is 10750 times more improbable than his estimate for the constants of the universe. And yet it happened.""

Nonsense. This is what being ignorant does to you.
When you deal a deck of cards out to people every permutation of the cards has the same chance as every other. But in playing a game of cards, this makes no difference. But suppose I wished to deal out the cards just once so that they were in a particular order, say Ace through to King of hearts, Ace through to King of spades, Ace through to King of Clubs, Ace through to King of Diamonds. I shuffle the cards, and then deal. The chances of them coming up in this order is 1 in 2,235,197,406,900,000,000,000,000,000. Or 1 in 2.235 x 10 ^27. But suppose I did it. Yes, it would be by chance, but the odds against it happening would be phenomenal. But these odds pale into insignificance against the odds that the universe has done exactly the same. That is why it is FAR more likely that the universe is NOT by chance tha tit IS by chance. 

16 ""Improbable things happen all the time. The improbability of something does not give you ANY justification for making up something to explain it.""

More nonsense. 

We are not talking here about dealing one hand of cards , but dealing that same hand in order, first time, after shuffling between deals, time and time again. 

17. ""He also keeps repeating this horrible fallacy: You can refute this if you wish, but ONLY if you can come up with a VALID alternative that is equally plausible, based on the evidence we see, and which cannot be refuted.""NO. I do not need a valid alternative to dismiss something you just made up. ""I don't know"" is a valid answer.""

At last someone has been a little more honest. Though I have 'made up' nothing (everything I stated can be verified scientifically and mathematically) at least this person suggested that he 'didn't know'. And, frankly, he will continue to be ignorant until he begins to look at things that stare him in the face. The elephant i the room in this case is more of a giant mammoth. It's just a pity that he is standing in the room with a blindfold on.

18. ""I just hope you know he didn't write all of that. Much of the argument he likely copied and pasted from a blog.""

Sorry to disappoint, but I wrote it. And all of it verifiable. If you still think its from a 'blog' tell me which blog it is from. You will have a long search.

19.""What existed before the big bang? Another universe? Nothing? Was there a previous universe that collided with ours? Did ours implode, causing the big bang? We don't know, and likely won't for a long time, if ever. Postulating a god on the possibility that there was indeed nothing before the big bang is nothing more than a giant ""what if"" statement.""

Well, according to Einstein (and ALL his relativistic claims have now been verified) time itself was created at the Big Bang, so there WAS no 'before' it. So now we have the absurd case of a spotty geek questioning Einstein. Incredible.

20. ""Also, I couldn't find where he said what his 2 degrees actually are. Keep in mind that some prominent creationists also have science degrees, but they are dentists and chiropractors and such. A degree in biology is not the same as a degree in astrophysics.""

Chemistry, elected also as a Member of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Astronomy, Theology. Are they suitable for you? Or would you have preferred my degrees to be in Media Studies, Origami and Needlework?

21. ""This guy is SERIOUSLY not worth the time of day. He's so incredibly full of himself that there is no argument on Earth that would even cause him to pause for a moment and think. Besides, he's a high school science teacher with, like, 2 degrees, who took an early retirement (read: got fired for trying to push creationism in public schools). ""

LOL 1. People retire early for many reasons - not least because they answer a call. Like John Polkinghorne, I decided to give up a cushy life in academia with a healthy salary, to take my (reduced) pension early (at the age of 51 to be exact) and actually sacrificially answer that call to do something far more worthwhile. And I've never been happier nor nore fulfilled. 2. ""Teachers"" do not 'get fired' for teaching Creationism in the UK. There is a national curriculum in science, I believe, in which the Big Bang is part of the physics syllabus. Or there was the last time I examined students for the Oxford Examinations Board. Oh, and, as I have made very clear time and time again, I am no Creationist. This particular idiot cannot refute anything so he resorts to a straw man argument against young-earth Creationism (which I am equally concerned about) , and insults directed towards me as an amazingly obvious straw man argument.

At this point I have given up. Much of the rest is of a similar ilk, written by jumped up pseudo-intellectuals out to impress. Frankly, if you think these are 'refutation' then you are particularly gullible and very sad.

I have only one apology to make. I did make the comment that the people here were a bunch of 'saddos' I was wrong. Reading through some of the comments here reminded me of my old university days when we would prop up the student's union bar and spend an entertaining hour eavesdropping on the leftie brigade with their Afghan coats and string vests plotting the revolution. They were predominantly from the Sociology department that occupied half a top floor of a large academic block that housed the Chemistry department on the lower floors. It was, so the story goes, because if there had been an explosion in the top floor of the chemistry department, the university would not lose anything of any great value.

Looking at these responses reminds me of these revolution plotters - all hot air, ignorance dimwittedness and blustering and nothing of any substance. Yes, I was totally wrong in caling them a 'bunch of saddos', and I apologise. No, they're not. They're a bunch of THICK saddos.

I think I have done with you. I've spent far more time here than I wanted to, so please don't contact me again.

I just hope and pray that one day you will come to your senses . But if not, enjoy your rather sad life debating about a God in which you have rejected in the first place. Ask yourself, though, why the interest in God here? Why not debate the existence of Robin Hood? Is God, like in the case of atheist C S Lewis's experience before he was ""dragged kicking and screaming to become Christianity's most reluctant convert"" actually trying to TELL you something?

Good day

I'm an atheist, but have quite a few good friends with ""new-age"" type inclinations. One of these friends I talk to fairly regularly, but generally avoid discussing her beliefs or my thoughts about them, since I feel like it'll only upset her. And besides, the messages they teach all seem positive, and the people she attends the events and circles with are all lovely and enhance her life. It is, at this moment, a big part of her life. However, we got to talking about these beliefs the last few days (and I did end up upsetting her, unfortunately), and after a while she wanted to know *why* I wanted to change her mind about them, to which I didn't really have a great response. I think her exact wording was ""why is it important to take something away from someone else?"" which I was disheartened by, because I really don't want to deprive her of something, but rather provide her with the ability to be wary of pseudoscience, fiction, and snake-oil merchants.  

I'd like to think that a belief in rational reasoning, logic and science is what has enabled us to progress so far as a species, and the more that join the ranks the merrier, but does it really matter if she's not on board (especially when in the vast majority of ways, she already is!)?  
**Do you lot think there's some actual harm to being spiritual?**  
I can't help but think that religions and cults all probably start out with some supposedly benevolent ideas, and then seem to unravel as they expand, but I worry that that's just a slippery slope fallacy. I also feel like lending any credence whatsoever to notions of angels or higher powers helps legitimise *all* the rest of religion, and I see no reason to ascribe supernatural influences to human events in the first place. I'm sorry if this doesn't have a more focused point, I'm just wondering what DebateAnAtheist's take on spirituality is, and if they feel like spirituality has a place in today's world, and if it does harm or good.

I think it's the first time I've actually gotten into a debate with someone I know like this. I've enjoyed reading other people's debates on here so I thought I'd leave mine here too. I've also included a brief commentary. Feedback is welcome.

&gt;Me: Hi, I read the thing from your pastor you just posted. I'm not looking for a debate or anything, but this part in the conclusion caught my eye: ""Even atheists have faith. They have faith that the world was created out of nothing."" This is actually a misrepresentation of atheism. It's a common misunderstanding. Atheism isn't a belief in nothing. It's simply a lack of belief in gods. Nothing more. No faith needed. If that's confusing for you I'd be happy to answer any questions you have. 

*I really just wanted to clear that up.*

&gt;Him: OK, thanks. I'll even talk to my pastor about what you said. Have a good day.

*So far so good.*

&gt;Me: Good idea! Then I guess let me know if HE has any questions.

*One week later.*

&gt;Him: I had an interesting discussion with my friends about what you said and I think we all agreed that he didn't use the term ""faith"" in the sense that you were thinking. He meant faith in the sense of meaning 'trust.' For example everyone has trust in something. It's just a matter of where we all put that trust in. For atheists, they put most all of their trust into science. But for Christians, we put all of our trust in Jesus. The main point of the message was that we should put all of our trust in Jesus. 

*I don't think he really understood, but he seemed receptive so I reiterated.* 

&gt;Me: Thanks for getting back to me. I’m glad to hear you discussed it with your friends. I think interpreting his sermon that way is more reasonable, but I would still like to point out that even saying “atheists ‘trust’ that the world was created out of nothing” is incorrect. Scientists don’t yet know what came before the big bang, or even if ‘before’ means anything in that context. Atheists are just comfortable saying “I don’t know” until answers are found. 

&gt;It sounds like what you are saying is that science and Christianity are in opposition to each other. Am I right? I mean, I would agree, but most religious moderates are emphatic that there should be no conflict. Just out of curiosity, can I ask where you and your friends stand on the subject of science? 

*This is where it started to go off the rails. He's all over the place.* 

&gt;Him: I do know that atheists put all of their trust in science. But it's interesting that you say you don't believe that the world was created out of nothing which is what most creationists would believe. At least we can agree on that point. As far as the Big Bang theory, I believe that if it did happen, God caused it to happen which would lead me to your question. I'm actually not in total opposition to science and a lot of my Christian friends feel the same way. Basically to deny science would be ludicrous. It's there but I think where atheists and Christians differ is how it got there. You say that you're not sure where it came from. I would say that God created it. I noticed many people (not saying atheists, just a general statement) believe in karma. They go as far as to say that if they do something bad to someone, it will eventually come right back at them. If they do something good for someone, something good will happen in return. My argument is that if people can believe in a ""force"" why can't they just take it a step further and say that God is the one behind that? 

*I probably should have left it there, but since he did ask, I thought I'd give an account of why some people cant take that step further and believe in God. I cautiously proceeded.*

&gt;Me: Thanks. You say you’re not in total opposition to science, but then you say it would be ludicrous to deny science. To me, those are conflicting statements. What do you mean exactly? 

&gt;If you’d like an answer to your question “Why can’t people believe in God?”, maybe I can help you to understand. I was raised as a fairly serious Christian, so I know very well what that’s like, but I think lifelong Christians (I don’t know, but maybe you fall into this category) can have difficulty understanding how anyone can not believe.

&gt;If you’re interested in understanding the REAL reasons, I recommend you take a look at this excellent series of short (5 to 10 minutes each) instructional videos. They explain things very clearly and I think you, as someone who enjoys thinking about these questions, will find them very interesting.

&gt;3. Misconception - Atheists are not moral relativists and the writers he is referring to specifically and repeatedly say so. He's either being dishonest, or he hasn't read them. Morality is measured according to how much harm or suffering is caused. It's a very useful measure. 

&gt;When the misconceptions are cleared up, there's nothing much left. Is there any particular part you would like to hear my opinion on? 

&gt;Let me say too, that the videos I linked you to are not attacking religion but defending atheism. They're designed to help religious people appreciate why some people don't believe, so I hope you don't see them as an attack. 

*I thought it was a pretty reasonable and diplomatic way to respond, and I was hoping he would have some questions about the videos I linked him to, but no.* 

&gt;Him: 

&gt;1. As far as your idea that #1 is a misconception, then I guess you would have to talk to Mr. Dawkins about that. He was the one that said that.  The point was that the ""new atheists"" like to criticize theists with their wit and charm and try to make them look stupid. 

&gt;2. As the title suggests, he is anti-evolution, not anti-science. I watched his one-hour lecture last night and he even says that the Big Bang Theory points to God. As I mentioned the Big Bang Theory needs a bigger banger. He just doesn't believe that something comes from nothing as many atheists do.

&gt;3. Here is where I think your argument has the biggest crack. How exactly do you measure morality? There has to be a standard to measure it by. Who says ""murder"" is wrong? Why is murder, rape, stealing, and other crimes wrong if there is no God? It makes no sense. That was his point. If an atheist is not a moral relativist, then you are believing in absolutes right? How can you believe in absolutes if there is no God?

*He pulled out the thing I corrected him on in the beginning.* &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; *I really didn't know what to say.*

&gt;Me: ""He just doesn't believe that something comes from nothing as many atheists do."" 
Isn't this how we got started? :)

*Rhetorical question.*

&gt;Him: Nope. ;)

*Exasperated now.* 

&gt;Me: No?? Yes it is! I messaged you about the same allegation being in your Pastor's sermon! We're back to square one, ha ha.

*Just rolling my eyes.*

&gt;Him: I believe God created us. We came from something. That's all I'm saying. :)

*And this is where I gave up.*

&gt;Me: I know what you believe! :) If you read over my replies again, you'll see that I've said clearly multiple times that I'm not trying to challenge your beliefs. I'm just trying to help you undersand the viewpoints of those who don't share them, because I'm worried you have an inaccurate understanding of what atheism is and why atheists think the way they do.

&gt;It just makes me sad when I hear people say atheists believe that everything came from nothing and that morals are relative. We don't. And we don't eat babies either! haha. 

&gt;Anyway, I have enjoyed the discussion, but I don't think I'm achieving what I set out to achieve, so how about we put it to bed? 

*But he still didn't get it.*

&gt;Him: You're also not understanding my point either. If atheists don't believe in moral relativism then where does the standard come from? It's Natural Law right? Where does Natural Law come from? Atheists have no idea and theists believe God established a moral standard which is how we got the 10 Commandments. Anyway you're right. We've reached an impasse but I enjoyed the discussion!

&gt;Greg Koukl: The New Atheism: old arguments, new attitude
This is a lecture that Greg Koukl delivered at the Apologetics Canada conference in March 2011.


&gt;Greg Koukl talks about the Four Horsemen of New Atheism: Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett, Sam Harris, and Christopher Hitchens. They believe that:

&gt;1) Believe in God and religion is irrational. Reason is on their side.

&gt;2) The discoveries of science have squeezed God out of the picture. Science is on their side.

&gt;3) Morality is on their side due to so many religious evil that has happened in the past. They say that if you're a fundamentalist you are dangerous.(However fundamentalist Christians would pray for you yet fundamentalist Muslims would kill you. Yet the media doesn't want to distinguish it that way.)


&gt;Rational challenges by new atheists fall into two categories:

&gt;1) Trashtalking- clever insults to intimidate the opposition. They have rhetorical impact but no substance. Even if Christians agreed with the trashtalking, all we would have to do is respond with ""So?"" A) Some people say Christians are dumb. So if Christians are dumb therefore Christianity is false? So? Many Christians are dumb. However there are many non-Christians who are dumb too so where does that get you? What follows from that? The conclusion doesn't follow the premise. We can say that Christians are dumb THEREFORE Christianity is false. Does that argument have any validity? No, the conclusion doesn't follow. It's not adequate..  They say that the church is filled with hypocrites. You might ask an Atheist how they would know and they might respond that they've never been to church before so how would they know? But let's just say the church was filled with hypocrites. So? What does that tell you about the truthfulness of Christianity and Jesus's message? There are a lot of fake people out there but how does that represent Jesus? It says a lot about the people that call themselves Christians but it says nothing about Jesus. It's just trashtalk. C) God is a crutch. So? Crippled people need crutches. For some, God is a crutch but just because we have a need that's fulfilled by believing in God doesn't mean that God somehow disappears from the universe. You can turn it around and say that atheists have emotional needs by rejecting the existence of God. So? Does that mean Atheism is false? No it doesn't. You can't refute the evidence by talking about something else. You can't refute Jesus's existence by saying Christians are hypocrites....And yes there are Christians that use this poor argument and shame on them if they do.

&gt;2) Silly logic- Arguments in which the conclusions do address the issue but still fail to make their point. The logics are non sequitur. A) Christopher Hitchens said that if you look to nature as for evidence of Design how can 98% of all the animals species be extinct? He takes this as evidence of there not being a designer. So what is his point? If a thing was really designed, it wouldn't go extinct, but they did go extinct so they weren't designed. Does this argument work? How many people own a buggy whip (used for horses to move when on a buggy that relied on horses). What happened to them? They've gone extinct. And yes they are not biological organisms so that makes them a bit dis-similar but the dis-similarity doesn't matter to the point because Hitchens point was that if anything goes extinct then there is no design. But there are all kinds of things that are designed or were designed that are not in use any more because the circumstances which they were designed for no longer pertain. When you have biological things that were designed for a certain environment and that environment changes, this isn't the fault of the Designer, it's just an acknowledgement that things change and that living thing goes extinct. The point here is that if something goes extinct has no bearing on whether it is or isn't designed as Christopher Hitchens suggests. That's silly logic. Extinction may tell you about changing circumstances but it tells you nothing about design. Hitchens in this particular objection has missed the point.  If God made the universe, who made God?This is the kind of question children would ask because they don't know any better. Richard Dawkins uses this as the backbone of his argument. He says that even a child knows to ask this question. Yes, the child will ask the question because the child doesn't realize the question is inappropriate. It's also known as ""Who designed the Designer?"" Yet an atheist doesn't believe God exists so they don't believe anything created God. A Christian believes God is eternal therefore he/she doesn't believe God was created. Neither person believes God was created so why would an atheist ask a Christian how God was created? There is nothing about the Theists case that requires him/her to answer who made God. The atheist might say ""Well you're asking who made the world?"" and they can respond with ""Who made God?"" This is a case of willful ignorance. When we ask who made the world, we all KNOW that the world was made. Everyone believes the world came into existence (Big Bang, Cosmology, etc.) Nobody holds to the eternal universe. Everyone believes the universe came into existence so it's reasonable then that if something came into the existence to ask what caused it. Nobody believes God was created or designed so why ask that question? For example, you go to the beach and you see shoe prints in the sand and you say to your buddy that somebody was there before you. We weren't the first ones at the beach. Then your friend says ""OK, wise guy who made the shoes?"" Are you justified that if you see shoe prints someone was walking there? The evidence is pretty clear. It wasn't the wind, the seagulls, or the seashells doing something accidentally. Yet you are in your rights to believe that the shoe prints were made by someone even if you don't know the maker of the shoes. You don't need to know who the manufacturer was to know something was manufactured. You don't need to know who the Creator or Designer was to know that it was designed. It's not a sound argument.

&gt;Cosmological Argument- The Big Bang needs a Big Banger. Every physical thing that began had to have something to begin it. The response from an atheist (especially Stephen Hawking) is that it's possible that the Earth came from nothing. OK, let's say it's possible. Does that fact that it's possible mean that it's reasonable? Everything coming from nothing. Would you put your money on that? If someone came to the front door and knocked, would you think that the knock knocked itself or would you get up and answer the door? Or your buddy says there's a letter for you on the table and you ask who brought it. The friend would then say ""nobody."" Who's it from? ""no one."" It's not logical. Things cause events and you would want an answer to effect with a sufficient cause. The reasonable thing is to answer the door and that the knock didn't knock itself. There is a difference between something being possible and something being reasonable. It's possible that monkeys can learn Shakespeare but it's not reasonable to believe that. We would like to think that Shakespeare wrote Hamlet and not some baboon. That's the more reasonable thing. Nothing is not the most reasonable answer as to what caused the beginning of the universe. The cause was probably something powerful, non-material, adequate to the effect, and something outside of historical time.

&gt;Is reason on the side of the atheist? No, reason is on the side of the theist.

&gt;Is Science on the side of the atheist?

&gt;Can you weigh a chicken with a tape measure? Because you can't does that mean the chicken has no weight? No. It just means you used the wrong thing to measure it by. Here is the first problem. Science is not capable of ruling out anything even in principle outside of the material realm. Using a tool that was meant to measure physical things is not going to tell you much about non-physical things. Certainly you can't disprove the existence of non-physical things such as gods, spirits, and souls simply because a physical measuring tool does not give evidence for it. Materialists want to reduce consciousness to something physical because their beginning point is particles and not God. They say there is no soul because 1) Scientists have been looking for a soul for years and haven't been able to find it. 2) The soul doesn't have enough space to fit in a body. This doesn't prove that they don't exist. If a soul exists, it's not physical, and if it's not physical, it doesn't need space to fit. It is possible to use physical material to infer the existence of a supernatural being. You can go the other way which is what the Big Bang Theory is. Something must have caused it to exist. Yet you can't put science before the Big Bang Theory because it has a limitation. Science has not said that God does not exist. It's just assumed. It's not that the scientific methodology was bad. It's just you came to the wrong conclusion. What's happening between science and religion now is based on a philosophical debate called materialism. If a theist tries to argue the point of when the universe came into existence, an atheist may say ""That's not science. That's religion."" They start labeling you as if to say your argument was poor. They think that if they can label it ""religion"" they can just dismiss the argument. A professor from Harvard said that ""our materialism is absolute.""

&gt;What about morality?

&gt;How can be there be a good God when there is so much evil in the world? In other for the objection to be raised, there must be evil in the world. A relativist's characteristic of morality is ""you have your view, I have my view"" and whatever you think is right is fine but I have a different viewpoint. If relativism is true, then there is no evil in the world. There are just different points of view on what people like and dislike. There is no real evil. If you are a relativist you can't help but submit to the objection if you are intellectually honest. Most atheists are relativists but they aren't consistent relativists. On one hand they want to argue relativism yet on the other hand they want to argue and complain about the problem of evil. Those things are inconsistent. For example one guy says he doesn't believe in God. You might ask ""Why not?"" He might say ""brussel sprouts."" You then ask ""brussel sprouts?"" He says ""Yeah they taste disgusting. God couldn't have made them."" You can't argue that because some people like them. But then he would say ""I can't believe in a God that would make something so distasteful to me."" It's a very shallow objection.

&gt;But let's say there is objective morality. Then the theist would ask what that is.If you say things are evil what do you mean? One might say ""You know, murder, rape, etc."" But you have just given examples of what is evil but you haven't said what actually makes those things evil. So what is evil? You might argue that it is when things aren't as they should be. Look at bowling. In order to determine how good you are at bowling, it requires a scoring system. If morality is objective then we have to have a scoring system as to tell us that rape and murder are evil. If objective morality requires a standard, then where did the standard come from? Where did the rule book come from? It has to be transcendent, not just based on opinions, and it can't be evolution because that will only give you relativistic morality because it's the best that it can do. The argument for evil is actually an argument that God DOES exist. This objection does not make sense in an atheistic world. It's the moral argument for the existence of God.

&gt;Chris Hitchens talks about religion being the greatest evil in the world. He says that more wars have been fought and most blood has been shed by religion. First of all it's a factual observation about history. More blood has been shed by religion. This is just plain false. More blood has not been shed by religion. The 20th Century was the bloodiest century in the history of the world and the 20th century alone conservatively estimates that over 100,000,000 died at the hands of three men: Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. What linked them together? A materialistic view of the world that God did not exist. Richard Dawkins argued that they didn't do it in the name of atheism but that's completely irrellevant because there's a natural connection between ideas and consequences and when people believe there is no moral authority over to whom they have to answer. Yes there are good atheists but is it required of them to be good? Absolutely not. If they have the power to do what they want they get the gulag and you get that kind of carnage at massive levels. There is also the argument that some religious people do evil therefore all religion is evil. Or some religions teach evil therefore all religions are evil. That doesn't follow. Or some religions teach evil and some religions do evil therefore God does not exist. That doesn't follow either. It's silly logic. How can you directly hold Jesus, the Bible, and God accountable because one person didn't follow what Jesus said in the first place? If they didn't follow Jesus instructions and they disobeyed what he said, how can Jesus be held responsible? Jesus is not responsible for those who go in his name but do the exact opposite of what he teaches.

The argument was what it means to believe. It all started when I asked my step father why his one God was special when there are thousands of other Gods all throughout time that he doesn't believe in. He said he believed what he did because it was the way he was raised, and I proceeded to say that that was exactly my point. If he had been raised in Iran, he'd be a Muslim. India, Hindu. Greece in 1000BCE, Zeus and co. You get the idea.

What then happened blew my mind. Basically, all three people I was talking to, just said that what they believed was right for them but what others believe is right for the others. They believed what they believed and they didn't feel others to be wrong. I said their view made no sense, considering when you accept Judaism unto yourself, you believe everyone else to be wrong, but they didn't see it that way. I asked them all when someone of the Hindu faith dies, who judges them, and they all answered with ""For them, the Hindu Gods.""

It made no sense to me. I talked about the nature of belief and how when you say you believe something, to you, anyone who does not believe what you believe is therefore wrong.

I basically set up a proof:

P1. By professing a belief in Judaism you accept Jewish law
P2. Jewish law states there is only one God.
C1. A Jew believes there is only one true God, Yawheh

P3. Any one who professes belief in another God is wrong.
P4. Hindus believe in multiple Gods
C2. Hindus are wrong.

They didn't see it like that.

I then said that the question of ""Does God Exist?"" has an answer. It is either yes or no, but they wouldn't accept that either.

I then tried comparing it to baseball teams, saying that guy A. can think the Yankees will win the World Series, guy B. will think it's the Red Sox, and guy c. thinks it will be the Phillies.

Recently got into a discussion on the validity of the story of Jesus's resurrection, and I don't really have much to say to the points brought up. I was hoping you guys could point me in the right direction (seeing as how I'm a chemistry major and not well versed in biblical history)

&gt; Well let me give you some facts: The Gospels are historically and textually accurate despite the original manuscripts having not survived the last 2,000 years. There are over 24,000 manuscripts and the textual differentiation in syntax and language varies by only 3-6%

&gt; Source: http://www.irr.org/bible-reliable.html 

&gt; The Gospels are not the only source of historical evidence that Jesus existed let alone was crucified and performed ""miracles"". Cornelius Tacitus one of the most prominent first century Roman historians stated ""Christus, the founder of the name, was put to death by Pilate, procurator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius: but the pernicuous superstition, repressed for a time broke out again, not only through Judea, where the 'mischief' originated, but through the city of Rome as well.""

&gt; Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian in early first century described Jesus: ""Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call Him a man, for He was a dower of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to Him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was the Christ, and when Pilate at the suggestion of the principal men among us, had condemned Him to the cross, those that loved Him at the first did not forsake Him; for He appeared to them alive again in the third day; as the divine prophets had foretod these and tenthousand other wonderful things concerning Him.

&gt; Other historians describing Jesus, eyewitnesses of His return, and the early church include: Seutonius, Plinius secundus, Tertullian, Thallus, and Phlegon



&gt; There are easily four ways you can disprove Christianity:

1. If you can prove Jesus never was crucified
2. If you can explain the empty tomb
3. If you can explain there were post-resurrection appearances
4. If you can explain the existence of the Church itself



&gt; 1. The historians I mentioned all confirm the same information, that Jesus was a real man, a spiritual teacher, and was crucified and died. A study done by William Edwards, MD; Wesley Gabel, MDiv; Floyd E Hosmer, MS titled ""On The Physical Death of Jesus Christ"" written in March of 1986 and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association states the impossibility that Jesus could have survived the flogging, dragging, physical abuse, and crucifixion that preceded His death.

&gt; 2. The tomb was found empty by two female followers. Women were considered to be invalid witnesses in court and in society and thus if a group were to make up a hoax, they would not back it up using women. The tomb was publicly known and was owned by a prominent rich man, Joseph of Arimathea, if the Jewish people were making a big deal out of it and causing a riot, then the authorities, either Roman or Jewish would investigate the ""correct"" tomb and prove to everyone that Jesus was indeed still dead in the tomb. If the disciples stole the body, then why would they have all died (except John) excruciating executions and deaths in the name of a lie and a hoax that they started? Next, how would the Christian church have survived and started in Jerusalem if Jesus was crucified there and it was known that the tomb was never empty?

&gt; 3. Jesus appeared to over 500 witnesses throughout Judea and the historians I commented on state the social movement and spiritual change in the people due to the appearances. It is historically factual to say that there was an aroused population AFTER Jesus died and that it was due to a shared experience: the appearance of Jesus. What needs to be explained is if this was a hallucination or a giant hoax that everyone agreed to.

&gt; 4. The Church itself shouldn't exist if Jesus never resurrected. Early Christians wouldn't have died under Nero and other tyrants if they had not had proof that Jesus was resurrected in the first place. The Church wouldn't have preached to Jerusalem-residents first, those who could have easily proven that Jesus was still dead and in a tomb.




&gt; So I'll pose to you a likelihood. How more likely is it that all of these historians were misunderstood or misinterpreted their contemporary events than that God really does exist? Is it irrational to believe that there is something beyond the physical world?

I see all the time on /r/atheism etc. that there is very little evidence for Jesus, or that anything that he did or said actually happened. 

However in a discussion with friends recently I brought this point up and they (even though they are not religious responded with a great deal of anger that I would question Jesus at all. Recently I decided to look up the [wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus) on this to see what was there and it repeatedly stated something along the lines of ""Most modern historians agree that Jesus existed"". 

In the historical/evidence section the following was stated:

&gt; Robert E. Van Voorst states that the idea of the non-historicity of the existence of Jesus has always been controversial, and has consistently failed to convince scholars of many disciplines, and that classical historians, as well as biblical scholars now regard it as effectively refuted.[25] Walter P. Weaver, among others, states that the denial of Jesus’ existence has never convinced any large number of people, in or out of technical circles.[24][371][372]

The article seems to say that the main evidence for Jesus are the four Gospels, even though their intent is scriptural rather then historical. 

What do you believe, and why? What evidence is there to support your beliefs?

I am an atheist, but would love to hear debate from both sides, as it is mostly irrelevant to this question. However since the wikipedia page is largely in support of the existence of Jesus I think it would be best to start this off with the counterpoint.

But my question today is addressed to both, think into yourself, the world, deeply, and answer it, I want everyone to be as honest with himself as much as possible, cause for every single unique person, it can say and mean a lot of different and unique things.

**Here it is :** 

***Whoever you are, would you want a god to exist?***

* Here is my subjective, unique and honest/true to only myself answer :

I was born muslim, and everything i've known about islam, i've known it through my parents, they were good people, when i grew up, i started learning a lot of things from outside that i didn't like.

Recently, i discovered atheism, i started having doubts, i've read a lot about atheism, and i finally decided to be honest to myself, i wanted to be honest with my parents too, I was ready for hell, but the answer of my father surprised me : ""you studied and really deepened your knowledge about atheism, and looked at it through your eyes only, now go do the same about God"".

I started studying about islam, I discovered a lot of things, and then, I realized that what i was made to ""deduct"" from religion, wasn't really what I deduct and learn from it now.

I've been through a big circle, and a really dark pit, i thought i was worthless, a walking meat of nothingness, in a corrupt cold world, and every single negative feeling about existence one could possibly have, I started not listening to myself, i forgot myself.

Suddenly, I remembered what made me think, it's only one ""being honest to myself"", i realized that if there is a god, he trusts me, and when i looked deep, i found out that i REALY, REALY, REALY wanted god to exist, like in the deepest of my wishes, doors opened, and my mind cleared up to a lot of things that are too many and too complex, that i can't really discuss them in one text, now I have more faith than ever, and even if am the last to believe in a god in this world, my faith in him will grow only bigger, his existence gave me faith in myself, i resurrected, and is true to myself more than ever, and this is the least i can repay him, even if he is only my sky daddy, he is one good damn sky daddy.

I know this will seem cheesy, stupid, ignorant, lie, drama, brainwashing, fairy tale....... etc, and I don't really care, whenever I feel bad, i remember one story from koran, only one :

(God created earth, and contemplated it, he then said to the angels, i will create humans, they said to him ""Why would you create someone to ruin the earth, after you perfected it"", he answered, ""I know what you don't know"", he then created adam, and asked the angels to bow to him, because he created humans in a higher rank than every other creature, we can learn, and we can make a difference between right and wrong, and no other creature can, they all bowed, except Satan, he then asked god, to let him for a challenge to humans, he will try to prove why humans aren't better than him, by hitting and nullifying that one thing that makes us the best ""will"")

God is trusting me against Satan, is trusting me to know wrong from right, is trusting me to beat one of his greatest creatures, lucifer, by my will alone, i thought to myself that even if this is real, then satan is winning, but looking deeply i realized that my mere existence, me, a nobody, my mere insignificant will, was a win to me and god against him, that is how much i feel important, if i die and there is nothing of all of this, then i'd least vanish feeling important, that's how much i want a god to exist.

I can't not return his trust, even if it seems like a fairy tale, after all, even in my day dreams and imagination, I can't hurt or deceive anyone.

**TL;DR**: Whoever you are, and whatever you believe in, Do you want a god to exist?

**Edit**: First excuse my poor language, i just want to ask a favor, if you are going to upvote or downvote, leave a comment, even if that comment is ""idiot"", or ""i want"", or ""i don't want"", but let me know what you think, i don't seek appreciation for my views, everyone has his own views, i want to know what are your stories, how did your believes develop, even if i get appreciation or disgust, if i don't know what you think, then it won't matter for me.

**Edit 2**: I don't remember asking for your judgment or appreciation to my views, either way, they'll never change, if you want to write ""i don't care"", ""idiot"", ""i don't want"", feel free, but give me your opinion about your views, i don't want your opinion on mine.

**Edit 3**: Nice feedback everyone, Even if the general opinion seems to consider the abrahamic gods to be ""evil"", and that reality is better than ""fiction"", which is opposite to my view, i still appreciate that people were honest, i hope.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_qfvpk,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/qfvpk/an_unusual_question/,

Now I did consider posting it in [/r/debatereligion](/r/debatereligion) but I felt I was after it from a different point of view. 

The argument is of course:

1. If 'God' does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist.
2. Objective moral values and duties do exist.
3. Therefore, God exists. 

I don't want to get into discussing the syllogism itself merely the idea of objective moral values.

I cannot see how objective moral values can exist without an objectively moral judge. So if this judge do not exist then surly objective moral values do not exist and the argument is flawed.

Is this not circular logic? As first you have to prove that this ""judge"" exists before claiming objective morals exist.

In summary: How can this be used as an argument to support the existence of God when it relies on the existence of God to support the argument itself? 

If theists are not relying on the existence of God to support this argument, where is the evidence in the universe that objective morality exists without God?

Edit: Just to be clear I am agnostic, and I am of the opinion that morality is relative not objective. This is not what I want to discuss right now, but the two sentences above^^

Edit2: Cheers for the debate guys, even though we ended up discussing the actual syllogism a little, people seem to agree that the argument relies on the existence of God when it is trying to be used to prove the existence of God at the same time.

To expand a little bit:  the theist contends that everyone believes at least some things on faith.

I understand that the earth is very old, I understand geology, I understand continental drift, I understand the age of the universe, I understand how gene selection and pressures produce diversity, I understand how competition forms the society and culture we live in.  I understand the mechanisms by which we believe genes are transferred and changed through species, and I understand just how little we understand about abiogenesis.  

What I don't understand is how we an equate the natural (or artificial) selection of genetic traits (genes), such as that evident in dogs or foxes after domestication, with the creation of new systems of genes.  To me there is a fundamental difference between the creation of cognate genes (that fill the same ""semantic"" spot in the biological system (which is all we see within the full range of dogs/wolves/foxes, or cats/lions etc.) and the creation of genes that actually fill roles in new systems of meaning.  I see examples of genetic diversity all around, and the more I understand of genetics the more I find we are able to explain almost every ""development"" as being the result of pre-existing flexibility of expression within the system.  In other words, I see almost unlimitted genetic change leading to merely different versions of the same genetic system rather than the development of different systems, with no mechanism for systemic change that can account for what we see today.  As a linguist the differences between the two types of change have obvious parallels in language, with the major difference being that biology is far more conservative and unforgiving of changes.

To this I'll add, I don't understand why the fossil record shows species arriving and leaving looking the same after millions of years - why should evolutionary forces not impact the species?  If anything, we shouldn't even have the concept of a species in the fossil record if we assume that mutations happen at the rates required to go from abiogenesis to us in the number of generations we assume based on gestational periods for larger animals.  The very question of ""gaps"" should be laughable, in light of a complete absence of ""plateaus"", yet overwhelmingly we only seem to have these unchanging species.  to posit punctuated equilibrium only compounds the problem, as we are now suggesting even more mutations in a fraction of the time, mutations which we have almost no evidence for.  In fact the only thing I can see that could explain the fossil record yet still allow for evolution would be to assume that the entire record is the result of massive catastrophes that gave us snapshots of moments of history, rather than a gradual buildup of sediment.

lastly - why is belief required for comprehension of anything?  It's called suspension of disbelief and we do it all the time.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_m51aa,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/m51aa/atheists_what_does_it_actually_mean_to_truly/,

My question is for those of you who make such claims:

Without accepting God (or a god, gods, or any over-arching metaphysical narrative for that matter), what basis do you have for claiming that religious people have committed such evils?

 It seems you can claim that morality (or the ability to claim that an action is evil, bad, or wrong) on the basis of an evolutionary imperative; we developed morals because of a herd instinct which enabled us to become a dominant race (this is a paraphrase of Nietzsche's theory). The problem with this is that there is no objectivity to this morality; each system of ethics must necessarily be based on different cultural influences since our morality is based on  our particular ""herds.""

Another possibility is utilitarianism, the idea of ""the greatest good for the greatest amount of people."" This is Sam Harris' contention for an objective morality, but on what basis do we decide what is good if that is the case? Many things that we see as ""good"" others see as ""bad."" For instance, there is a tribe in Africa who thinks that physically retarded babies are actually hippopotami. In their understanding, what is ""good"" is to give the baby hippopotamus back to its own kind by laying in a river with others. We most likely view this as a ""bad"" thing, but that is because we understand (or think we understand) that physically retarded babies are also humans. 

The question still stands; on what basis do you propose an objective morality? And if you cannot provide such an objective morality, how do you justify your moral critiques of religious people?

His retort was 'can an atheist be a pedophile?'

After some back and forth, I refused to compare atheism and islam and refused to answer his question, ""can an atheist be a pedophile?""

I called it stupid and dismissed it.

In retrospect, it would have been more productive to just answer the question than to start off on several seperate arguments about honesty in debate, but I still feel like I'm justified dismissing a comparison between a religion that claims that a pedophile is the perfect man and nonbelief in god.

Thoughts?

Thanks in advance, I'm really looking forward to some feedback.

The person I am debating with keeps citing faith healers as proof of God. Specifically, he is pointing to John Lake's ministry in the early part of the 1900s and Katie Souza from present day's Expected End Ministries. I have pointed out that these claims of healing are not backed up by science, and that often times these people are incredibly dishonest. Lake was a known con man, in fact.

1) Do you completely deny that there is any sort of ""greater power"" beyond what we currently understand? As in that maybe it isn't a deity but perhaps some other spiritual force that isn't a living being? Or would that even be considered a ""greater power"" at that point and just undiscovered/ explained science?
2) How do you usually respond to the question of ""where did the atoms that started the big-bang come from""? Is that question even relevant when it comes to discussing the existence of a deity?
3) Do you still feel ""spiritual"" despite not having a religion? As in you have a connection or oneness with the universe and life beyond just your emotions and the things you experience in everyday life? What is your explanation for those feelings/ lack of feelings?
Also if there are any good resources that discuss these sorts of questions I'd greatly appreciate a recommendation. Thanks!

In order to get to the present in an infinitely old universe, an infinite amount of time must be passed, but it's impossible to cross an infinite amount of time. Therefore the universe can't be infinitely old and couldn't have always existed.

Objective morality doesn’t seem to be a possibility if there is no God (which we can define as an omnipotent being who arbitrarily decides what is good and what is bad because he makes it so) – but I’ll get to that later.  

More importantly, it doesn’t seem like there are any objective values.  For example, why is suffering or death bad?  Because we don’t like it?  Well what does that matter?  Why is liking something better than disliking something? And so on, and so on.  Anything that would seem to have value would only have value because you assign value to it (so as long as you are pursuing what you value, you are right).  But I would go even further and say that value itself is meaningless.  There is no such thing as justice and injustice…things just are.

I think Sartre would say something to the effect that, as long as one is aware of their total freedom and thus responsibility, any “invention” so to speak is a valid as another’s, as long as it fulfills you, personally.   Nietzsche, I think, would argue that what determines right or wrong in his morality is one’s power or will being forced on another.   I want to go even further and question why does fulfilling our desires matter?  Why do things that matter ought to be pursued?  And so on.

Now, it would seem, if there were no objective values, than there is no objective morality, and thus no moral absolutes.  To follow this to its ridiculous end, that would mean rape, genocide, and all crimes aren’t wrong, because there is no right and wrong.  (If you think this is just silly at this point, consider an utilitarian example: an evil demon gives you a choice, that either he will get to rape a serial killer or he will exterminate all life in the universe.  All that’s left to decide, so to seem, is what you like better, cause, if this is all true, nothing matters.  Now if we apply this to every action, then, again, no morality).

Now one response I’ve seen in an earlier discussion, which really intrigued me, is this: “all moral systems are based on some sort of axiom. Secular moral realism (of the [Sam] Harris variety) is based on the axiom that suffering is worse then well-being. If you want to argue the validity of that axiom, go right ahead.”

So that’s another thing to discuss: do you guys a) believe you can prove that suffering is worse than well-being (or some similar sentiment), or b) have an general argument for its merit?

I will list my arguments, and I would love some feedback.

Pascal's Wager - Everyone should believe in god, because it is better to go to heaven if he does exist, and even if he doesn't you still will lead a moral life. If you don't believe, you have a 50/50% shot of going to Hell forever.

1. Gods word = the Bible. Just because you follow the Bible, does not make you a ""moral"" person in today's society. You must follow all of god's rules, and not just the Ten Commandments. Therefore, things like slavery, murder, etc. would be permitted under special circumstance. Therefore, life would not be ""better"" for everyone if we all follow god's word.

2. God is not omni-benevolent if he sends his creations to Hell for not believing in him. If he is not all-loving, he is capable of possessing hate or dislike. If he is capable of possessing those, he can possess mortal characteristics, such as ego, vanity, and pride. Therefore, god can sin.

3. If god can hate elements of his creation, then he is not all-powerful. Otherwise, he would have created a perfect world of believing people. He either a) enjoys sending people to hell, because he is an evil god, or b) is not capable of creating a perfect world. If he cannot create something as simple as perfect humans, then he might not be capable of even creating heaven/hell/the universe.

4. Free will allows for a Nobel Peace winner atheist to be condemned to Hell, and a murdering rapist Christian to be sent to Heaven. If this is the case, and all sins are forgiven for believing in god/Jesus, then why do Christians need to uphold moral standards? If the whole purpose of life is to just believe in god and then go to heaven, we should indoctrinate all children and then kill them. There would be no need for life on earth at all.

Thanks to all the great help from redditors (admittedly, with an extent of copypasting), I've pretty much finished my opening salvo, and would like to run it by y'all to see if it can be improved before I send it.**

***EDIT: Thanks very much for the feedback! I made a few tweaks as advised and have now sent it. Reddit will be the first to hear when I get a reply!***

""Firstly I'd like to talk about the ability of same-sex couples to raise children, which is often cited in arguments against same-sex marriage. The scientific research that has directly compared outcomes for children with gay and lesbian parents with outcomes for children with heterosexual parents has been remarkably consistent in showing that lesbian and gay parents are as fit and capable as heterosexual parents, and their children are as psychologically healthy and well-adjusted as children reared by heterosexual parents. Sources:

http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/Marriage%20of%20Same-Sex%20Couples%20Position%20Statement%20-%20October%202006%20(1).pdf

http://www.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/LGBT-Families-Lit-Review.pdf
(Unfortunately I can't claim to have read this in its entirety, but used the contents to get to the relevant bits!)

http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2010/10/27/amicus29.pdf
(Again, due to time constraints this had to be skimmed a bit but from what I got through there's plenty of evidence inside to support the conclusion it reaches)

Indeed, major associations of mental health professionals in the U.S. and Canada have not identified credible empirical research that suggests otherwise. More sources:

http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/AP_06_pre.PDF

http://www.cpa.ca/cpasite/userfiles/Documents/advocacy/brief.pdf

In my opinion, it is family processes (such as the quality of parenting, the psychosocial well-being of parents, the quality of and satisfaction with relationships within the family, and the level of co-operation and harmony between parents) that contribute to determining children’s well-being and ‘outcomes’, rather than family structures, per se, such as the gender, sexuality and co-habitation status of parents. Evidence which supports this conclusion:

http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/gill-v-office-of-personnel-management/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf

As further practical evidence supporting this, countries that allow same sex marriage, such as Sweden, have in no discernible way been affected negatively by these marriages, in that they are very open, safe and peaceful societies, much more so than the UK or US (sources available on request!). I know, correlation does not necessarily imply causation; I'm not claiming that this is a direct result of the legalisation of gay marriage, merely that it's legalisation has had no discernible negative effect on society as a whole. With regard to the accusation that same-sex marriage has a negative impact on the concept of sustainable family, in the 15 years after Denmark granted same-sex couples the rights of marriage, rates of opposite-sex marriage in those countries had gone up, and rates of opposite-sex divorce had gone down – contradicting the concept that same-sex marriages would have a negative effect on opposite-sex marriages. Evidence that divorce rates are overall lower in same-sex marriages:

http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/07/06/divorce-rates-lower-in-states-with-same-sex-marriage

Furthermore, I've just realised that gay couples can already adopt in the UK so that issue isn't even relevant and can't really be used in opposition to same-sex marriage. If same-sex couples can already legally raise a child, then any arguments against their ability to do so cannot be applied to preventing their relationship being recognised by marriage.

Secondly, I'd like to question the validity of the idea that marriage in its current form is sacrosanct. Marriage has been redefined by the government many times. Things like age restrictions and divorce are dated modifications to marriage. To claim it can't be redefined is incorrect, and I'd suggest that that it is widely acknowledged that these changes have been for the better. Before 1929 it was possible to get married at any age but the government placed a restriction on that, redefining marriage to prevent child marriage from occurring. Apologies for using an extreme example, but 100 years ago you could marry a child against her will and rape her once it was done, and that considered was legal and Christian marriage (legally, there was no such entity as marital rape). Even when looking beyond a legal perspective and considering the general definition of marriage, it is not resistant to change. Dictionaries, to use an quantifiable indication on the changing meaning of marriage as an entity, have changed their definitions several times. There are also multiple dictionaries with different definitions of the same word. The Oxford English dictionary for example states marriage as: “The condition of being a husband or wife; the relation between persons married to each other; matrimony.” Which allows same sex marriage. The above examples indicate, then, that marriage CAN be refined and adjusted for the better, and has been on numerous occasions.

Thirdly, I'd like to oppose the arguments based upon purely religious views on changing the institution of marriage, whatever these may be. [The petition in question](http://c4m.org.uk/) argues in favour of maintaining the legal definition of marriage as it is, and such action would affect atheists and members of other religions than Christianity; therefore, opposition on a legal basis must be provided in purely secular terms, in the interests of the rights of those who are not Christian, since the law must treat them equally. The church can define Christian marriage in any way it pleases but there is no justification for this definition to be legally binding for the rest of the population. Marriage predates organised religion, it predates reliable recorded history, and exists today as a legal contract, for atheists and theists alike, whatever the additional implications theists may choose to associate with it. People are free to disagree with gay marriage but to use the government to prevent it is to violate the rights of homosexuals to exercise freedom of thought and association and have security of the person. This is favouritism of faith. This is essentially a case of values vs rights; it is acceptable for people to have different values about marriage in the UK or elsewhere, however it is not the job of the state to say which set of values are the right ones or wrong ones if they do not affect others. Therefore a legal option of homosexual unions should be available to those who are gay and wish to be married. If a particular religious organization wishes to deny marriage to homosexuals, then that is fine, but if another church or organization wants to provide marriages for gays then that is also acceptable. The debate over the definition of marriage shouldn't be the government's business because it is not the government's job to decide which values are the right values, but to honour a commitment to the the legal principles of human rights which create an equal playing field for different sets of values to contest each other.

Jason Heath makes this point better than I can; see section 2 (pg 30) of the following article:

http://www.csps-efpc.gc.ca/pbp/pub/pdfs/P118_e.pdf

Fourthly, by extension of my previous point, I take issue with the petition's assertion that 'no one has the right to redefine marriage for the rest of us'; in my opinion, legalising same-sex marriage would not in any way affect the marriages of heterosexual couples. Bearing in mind my previously stated opinion that children do not suffer in any way whatsoever from being raised by parents in a same-sex relationship, I can't think of a single secular harm that gay marriage poses to people outside of gay couples. Legalising gay marriage does not in any way devalue or influence marriage for Christian couples or indeed any heterosexual couples; they are still bound by the exact same principles and concepts as before, they are just extended to include others. Meanwhile, those who are homosexual and cannot marry are subjected to considerable injustice by the current state of affairs. Singling out gay men and women as ineligible for marriage both stigmatises and invites public discrimination against them. Denying same-sex couples marriage represents discrimination based on sexual orientation; several American scientific bodies agree with this assertion. Source:

http://www.apa.org/about/governance/council/policy/gay-marriage.pdf

Fifthly, I'd like to oppose the argument that consummation is required within marriage. No it's not, to suggest so would be stating that once married rape is legal within that married couple. If a couple get married and one doesn't want to have sex then by this reasoning they would be forced to. Infertile couples can still legally marry, so even having the potential to reproduce is not a necessary requirement of marriage, and there is no reason why this should be the case, as it would imply that marriage must always be motivated by other factors than love.

To conclude; Marriage is about love and commitment. Heterosexual love is not superior to homosexual love and vice versa. Therefore, partnerships should be held equally under the law regardless of the gender of the people in them. With changing norms and cultural diversity, our society is changing quickly and the definition of a family has to change with the times to recognise lesbian and gay families. Allowing same-sex couples to marry shows our commitment to diversity, equality, tolerance and respect. What's wrong with giving lesbian and gay couples in loving, committed relationships the same rights and protections under the law as heterosexual couples?

The most compelling argument, in my opinion, is simply that there is no reason to make it illegal. If the government are going to restrict the freedoms of any group of people, they better have a damn good reason. ""My god says so,"" is not a reason until one can demonstrate that their god exists, that he disapproves of homosexual marriage, and that we have any reason to listen to that god. There is absolutely no compelling evidence that same-sex marriage is harmful to anyone, including children if the couple are parents, therefore the government has no grounds to limit this right for homosexuals.

I hope you've found this interesting and look forward to your response! :)

1328803731.0,16,self.DebateAnAtheist,phw4y,Morality,Slapmesillymusic,17,1,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/phw4y/morality/,"I hear a lot of people (atheist/christian/muslim) saying that morality is something that you are born with. I don’t agree.  I say; morality is some thing that you are **born into** or join later in life. Here’s why;

I say that the concept of morality can be explained through behavioural sciences and that it has a psychological/sociological and even an evolutionary function. My definition is as follows.

*Morality is :*
What an individual in a group 
believes the group would find most favourable for that group in order to survive.

Take the notion of murder is wrong:

*I believe that the group I belong to considers murder of people within our group to be wrong. Therefore murder is wrong.*

Or on the other hand

*I believe that people close to me support murder of individuals within enemy groups. Therefore murder is **not** wrong* 


**Why do I think that my definition is the correct one?**

*Firstly*: because it gives an explanation that can be explained in terms of evolutionary advantages. That is, there are better chances of survival for an individual within a group than for an individual without a group. Therefore the group is in those terms more important for the individual than the individual is to a group. Therefore individuals who can think in terms of what is favourable to the group is more likely to survive. The next step is that a more closely nit group is more prone to survival than a loosely held group. 

*Secondly* This definition explains why for example the Nazis find it morally correct to act in a way that others find immoral. 

*Thirdly* If we view morality as a individuals thought process (subjective for the individual) it can also explain why peoples morals can change. If individual changes ”group” the morality of that individual will change. Since it is the ”new” group’s values that are taken into consideration when deciding wither or not is morally correct. 


**Why is this important?**

Because in knowing what morality is you are able to question what the group believes. It is also easier to confront the discrepancy between what you believe the group to believe and what the group actually believes. It also allows you to se through the ”veil” of morality, and consider the foundation of why the group believe in this way. 

But first and foremost it means that morallity isn’t a religious notion. It is a notion of psychology and sociology. That means it can be explained as to why it exist by showing the evolutionary advantages for an individual within a group that knows how to abstract itself within the group contra an individual that cant. 

To exaggerate: It gives us a better chance of survival if we don’t kill individuals in our group. It gives us a better chance of survival if we kill individuals of a rivaling group.  

This is how murder is immoral, whereas war isn’t. 


**In short** I think morality can be evolutionary explained 

**Edit** 
Very nice to se that so many people are interested in this subject! Thank you all for you'r contributions!

We theorize and believe that gravity comes from gravitons but at the time of posting this I'm ignorant to any hard evidence and observable proof of gravitons being the source.  So the graviton is theorized variable we've plugged in to the question ""Where does gravity come from?"".  What makes this variable more scientific than plugging in say God? (b) The scientific theory can not be used to define why ""the scientific theory"" actually works.  The scientific theory simple works because it does, is a concept found in many religions.

2.  Spontaneous Generation, is a concept that's been disproved for a long time now and our entire preserved food industry is based on this.  

3.  My belief is in a diety acting through natural laws to create and shape the universe.  I don't see science and the existance of a god as mutually exclusive.

Ideas like religion being intolerant, bigoted, driving nations to war etc.

Why are all these specifically because of religion? Please hear me out:

*""Religion is intolerant towards women - quote bible passage 1 Corinthians 10:3-10 etc"". 

If the social context of this bible passage is understood this passage is hugely liberal. In the time that Paul was writing to the Corinthians, women were persecuted hugely. The fact that he is advocating them being educated (going to church in the first place) is a huge step forward for the society then. When looking back on religious intolerance, it is easy to forget that society’s morals haven't been constant throughout time. What we consider moral now (liberalism, tolerance) would have been considered demonic 2000 years ago. We can’t look back and judge what happened 2000 years ago with 21st century ethics. From an academic point of view this would be absurd, because we would be ignoring the political and social nuances of the time.

*”Religion promotes wars - look at the Crusades/911 etc”

At the time that the bible was written, it’s purpose was to be a guide for people’s lives. To be accepted as a guide, it [b]had[/b] to allow societies to have something in common with the message it was trying to convey. Who would take it seriously if what it was saying went completely against societies norms?
My point here is that there has always been wars - before monotheism religions became mainstream, and no doubt a long time after they fade away. Why is it religions fault? How does /r/atheism manage to scientifically claim that these wars would not have happened without religious motivation? My example now goes to a modern war - Iraq. The reason we went to war was to “find the weapons of mass destruction.”. This war would have happened if it had been conclusively proved (it arguably was proved before we went to war) that Sadam never possessed anyway.

In a wandering sort of way, what I’m trying to say is that society would be just as bigoted, racist, intolerant and violent if religion wasn’t mainstream. These are aspects of all society, not just religious society. I take my reference from the fact that looking around the world, everywhere you look is an example of intolerance, regardless of religion. My specific example here is France. France is a country that is 33% atheist, 34% belief in a god, 27% spiritual [ref](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_atheism). This is as intolerant as places that are 90% belief in a god (Cyprus) [i]from my own experience[/i].

EDIT having read some of the responses. I realise that the bible isn't wholly applicable today. It can't be - it was written for a far different society. The fact that some people DO believe that it was written as a guide to their lives today is a detriment to them. However. I reckon that if the bible wasn't there to guide these people, they would look to an equally intolerant text for answers. Christianity [religion] exists because society tolerates (not sure if it's the right word), even needs it. If society as a whole becomes more tolerant, less bigoted, then religion will also become so. Look at the difference between the western world and the middle east. Western society is more tolerant, and so western religions are becoming more tolerant (slowly, granted, but changes are happening). Middle eastern society is as advanced as western society was ~500 years ago, and so it's religions and social beliefs reflect that.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_lvnii,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/lvnii/if_not_for_religion_the_world_would_be_a_better/,
1314350391.0,20,self.DebateAnAtheist,juyru,Defending a rational belief in God,morphinapg,39,19,509,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/juyru/defending_a_rational_belief_in_god/,"What do we know about the origins of our universe? Our biggest theory is the Big Bang. I completely support the Big Bang Theory, however it leaves far too many questions in my opinion. **In our universe**, every effect must have a cause. This means that the Big Bang must have been caused by *something*. Scientists have various theories on this, but all of them eventually lead to ""okay, but what caused that?"". 

For some people, they follow this with, ""Okay, but if it was God, what caused him?"" At first glance this seems like a valid question, but that's only if you look at God from the confines of our universe. Yes, in our universe everything must be caused by something else. However, if there is a God, he exists outside our universe, and is therefore not bound by the same rules. 

Okay then, let's assume *something* caused the Big Bang; maybe there was a universe before ours and a universe before that and each one causes a new one, going on forever. Doesn't our universe allow for this? No. For reasons having to do with entropy and the second law of thermodynamics, each universe will take longer than the last. As this would go on forever, if you keep going back far enough it would eventually lead to a universe with zero length and no obvious past. This is something that doesn't make sense with infinity. 

The universe had to start somewhere. Whether our universe is the first or the billionth is irrelevant. I personally believe it's the first, but if it wasn't it wouldn't make a difference. The fact is that every line of logic leads to the fact that the universe must have been created at some point. Note that this doesn't prove God. It simply proves that some external force must have created our universe. This could be a variety of things that we simply would be incapable of understanding. However, this also *allows* for the existence of God as the creator. Like I said, there's no proof, so it's not like it proves one God over another, or even if it was God in the first place. That's something you would have to determine on your own. However it allows for the possibility of God being the cause of our universe. 

Some people believe that it's irrational to believe in a God if you can't prove it. I think that in itself is an irrational line of thought. If God exists, he exists outside our universe and therefore exists outside our capability of proving. Much like other universes. If they exist, there's no way we could prove it. Yet we continue to allow for theories discussing the possibilities of them. 

As my line of logic leads to requiring something to have caused the creation of this universe, I believe it's rational to believe in something that supposedly already answers that question. As I know that because this cause would have to be an external force, from something outside our universe, I know science will never be able to answer it. Therefore, as this ""theory"" is the best theory I have found to answer this question, it's what I place my belief in. 

If you can come up with something more likely, feel free to share. However, note that not only will you have to prove that it's more likely, but you will have to do so using a set of rules outside the laws of this universe. Good luck with that.

Both men take up familiar positions; Craig claims that he's only defending two claims – that god provides a sound explanation for moral judgements &amp; duties and that without a god there is no sound ground for moral values – while Harris totes his much-criticized view that science can determine moral values.

One argument Craig brings against Harris that I found particularly convincing went at the heart of Sam's argument, that what is good naturally follows from what maximizes human well-being. If rapists get well-being from inflicting pain (physical and emotional), then there is a possible world in which the continuum of well-being is not an objectively moral landscape. The peaks or high points of well-being could be occupied by people we call evil. But in the actual world then these are not identical; identity is a necessary relation. Since the law of identity says no entity or property is the opposite of itself in any possible world, if there is a possible world in which the rapist (who does what is evil even on Harris’ view) receives well-being, then there is a world in which well-being is not identical to good. In this case, then it is actually true (on pain of a violation of the law of identity) that the good is not identical to well-being in this actual world either. 

This can be argued around by disputing the ""any world"" interpretation of the law of identity (this may have a similar falling as the ontological argument: the non-necessary correlation between what's possible and what _is_) or by arguing against the fact that rapists, while possibly maximizing individual pleasure, aren't actually maximizing well-being; obviously a world in which everyone was forcibly copulating and inflicting physical and emotional pain and embarrassment on everyone else is a step towards to the worst possible misery for everyone, not away from.

Craig's arguments brought mostly nothing to the table. He defines god as the greatest possible being, and therefore the greatest good, and then says that god's nature provides the standard by which moral judgments are judged by. This is, of course, a meaningless tautology; if you define god as the greatest good, then yes, that's a very easy way of determining what's good. What he didn't do is provide a reason why that might be the case, a statement of [bare assertion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipse-dixitism). I've seen people claim that Sam went off topic near the end and just started attacking god but I think it was relavent to this point; he was attacking the assumed goodness of god's nature. Craig's arguments were nothing special, but he had some fairly good points about Harris' arguments which Sam did not address. This disappointed me, as I really think Sam's Moral Landscape is, minimally, a novel idea that brings something new to the table and that I would love to see become more fleshed-out.

Part of that separation is tax exemption for religious institutions.

I hear many modern atheists saying it's time for us to tax churches (or synagogues, or mosques, or temples, or crazy underground Scientology bunkers). I guess the feeling is that religious institutions are part of our society, and thus obliged to contribute to our society. Or maybe the feeling is that religious institutions are no different from other collections of people, like a business or a family. Why are churches so special?

And that was kind of my point of view as well, for a little while. However, if a church is compelled to pay taxes, wouldn't the organization then suddenly have a voice in the political arena? They would want a say in how their money is spent, and they sure as hell wouldn't want their tax dollars supporting something they find morally objectionable.

I'm worried that if a religious group, fundie Christians especially, were afforded the opportunity to shape public policy based on their anti-intellectual, Stone Age philosophy, we'd be even worse off than we are now. We'd see science and morality backtrack. We'd lose a lot of progress.

As I say, I used to be of the former opinion; I saw a state that needs money and a group of people not chipping in. But now, the more I think about it, the more I'd rather see them excluded from paying taxes; far better to be gently coasting on top of others than to potentially actively participate in the regression of society.

-Nature is rational (there is an ordered, complex, understandable structure to the universe)
-Our minds are rational (we can perceive and evaluate this with our minds)

If we’re assuming nature is rational and our minds are rational, then what are we really assuming?  Clearly that whatever has produced them both is rational.  

On the other hand, the atheist idea is the universe has no rational cause.  If we assume this, then we assume the universe must not be rational, and our minds (being in that universe) must not be rational either.  And then how can we trust them?  

It seems to be me that every time we do science we are assuming that nature is rational, that our minds are rational, and thus that their source is rational.  Every time we get a scientific result, not matter what field, no matter what it is, and it WORKS, it is validating those initial assumptions.  Science, every day, validates the hypothesis of a rational source to the universe.

Take, for instance, those who don't. In Judeo/Christianity you get those who over-emphasize original sin, total depravity, suffering/passion/sacrifice, self-mortification, the supremacy of God compared to humans and so on. In eastern religions they emphasize the evil ego and idolize the total extinction of all desire. The atheist variety are nihilists and believe there to be no meaning to existence at all, life being nothing but an elaborate runaway accident. 

All in all, I wouldn't trust my kids to those who don't value life - regardless of what they believe.

And then there are those who do value and enjoy life. In Christianity they talk more about what Jesus did to heal people, about forgiveness and love. In eastern religions they emphasize the interconnectedness of the world, loving kindness and the sanctity of life, and atheists would talk about humanism, human-centered goals that reduce overall suffering, empathy and charity.

From reading these boards (and others), it seems clear that the real problems occur when those who value life clash with those who don't - regardless of their justification for their position. And, in fact, atheists who value life seem more *tolerant* of theists who also do, and vice versa.

Numerous posts have appeared over at /r/atheism detailing the events, but that's just backstory and not the content of this question.

The actual question is in response to a particular set of images I saw about the Oreo incident, including notions like ""Religious people say the won't buy oreos, but then they'd also have to stop using facebook,"" (because it also supports LGBTQ interests). That seems all well and good to me, but one particular example stood out; when someone used Alan Turing and modern computing to express a similar view.

On that point, I'd have to disagree. What I've gleaned from the religious people is an out and out ""I'm not supporting Oreo because Oreo supports homosexuals."" Then, the use of technology or things created by members of the LGBTQ community wouldn't be incompatible with their view so long as it did not actively support the people who made it, like Alan Turing, who is dead and cannot benefit (in any way of real value to him) from people using his creations. In any case, that's my reading.

So the question finally goes : Suppose a morally corrupt group like the Nazis were responsible for significant and important medical advancements (which they were), which they only figured out through inhumane torture of their held prisoners. Is it morally acceptable to utilize those advancements?

So my friend has been trying to argue an existance for God with me. It's quite frustrating. His arguments are almost entirely based around the idea of spirtuality and the ""feeling of God"" and that everyone feels God in their own way. He argues that like love or a nice piece of art, the Bible creates feelings within us and fills a hole in our life, or some form of this statement. He also believes that you can pick and choose which parts of the Bible you can apply to your life. 

Can you guys please provide some general arguments against people who argue for a spirtual existence of God and that's the only evidence that they need? A simple feeling within yourself? He also believes that everyone is their own God. 

I honestly don't care about these reasons because without scientific proof of an exsistence of God, there is no reason to associate any such feelings with that reasoning, however, obviously it is hard to get a religious person to see it this way.

I live in the Pacific Northwest which is generally a less religious area of the US so I haven't had a chance to run this argument by a real fundie yet, just wondering what you guys would think about it.

I've heard people argue against religion in politics by talking about the sort of things that would be made into law if any major sect of Islam came to power in the US.  I feel like an easier comparison for most people to swallow would be to ask what might happen if the Amish took over?  Despite their traditionally nonviolent ways you've got to admit that they hold some pretty extreme beliefs regarding technology which, if used to form the basis for their laws, would be extremely inconvenient at best and quite deadly at worst.

If the Amish took over:

**No more modern medical care:** No abortions, no contraceptives, no birth control, ok so far so good for the average fundie.  How about no vaccines, no antibiotics, no inoculations, no viagra or hair-loss medication.  Invasive surgeries can't be done with monitoring equipment and more treatments will be invasive without the use of imaging electronics such as X-ray and MRIs.

**No electronics:** This brings to mind that picture of the lady holding the ""Computer = Homo Devil Machine"" sign.  Okay, let's see how you cope without your cellphones, your digital music players, your cars.  We've lived without that stuff in the past but they invariably make life more convenient for us now.  How about this?  No landline telephone.  The closest contact is no longer seconds away via 9-1-1 but minutes, even in a life-or-death situation where it can make all the difference.

**Self-Defense:** Say goodbye to guns.  If someone attacks you or tries to take something from you just back off and let them do it.  Retaliation or revenge is against the will of God or else why would the bad things happen to you in the first place?  If a loved one is raped they just have to suck it up and deal with it.


-----


These are just a few examples of what life might be like under Amish culture.  One immediate rebuttal might be that even if the Amish took over people would still be able to vote unfavorable politicians out of office.  Well what if they started changing the rules to vote as is common in many southern elections.  We've already ruled out electronic voting machines, so paper ballots it is.  What's that?  You didn't bring your own pencil?  Sorry, can't vote.  Oh, you brought your own pencil but you bought it at the store?  Nope, gotta be a grease-pencil you manufactured yourself.  The ballot-box got stolen on the night of the election because the people responsible for it didn't resist?  Looks like you don't proper representation this year.

To me that's what it feels like as an atheist in the US dealing with fundies who want to push their religious ideologies on any and everyone no matter what they believe.  Like I said before it seems to me this comparison is easier to understand for many fundamentalist Christians because now we're talking about a sect of Christianity that's closer to home rather than Islam which generally causes fundies to lock down tight because of any mistaken beliefs they might already have about Islam, however appropriate the comparison might actually be.

(Sorry for length),-1984-,17,2,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/rm7so/fellow_debaters_please_review_and_critique_so_i/,"**Background**: Priest from my former parish posted this on his facebook:

Others have simply stopped practicing any religion. This is extremely painful for me as a priest and as a Catholic. I would appreciate any thoughts why persons are leaving the Church and what would you suggest to bring them back home. PLEASE BE HONEST?""

I normally don't debate religion and theism on facebook, but when asked, I usually oblige. 
Prior to my response, a lot of catholics had posted their problems with the church, lack of youth involvement, etc. Finally, some good stuff started: 

**Bobbo:** 
&gt; Alot of reasons. Most deal with lack of credibility in doctrine and in the institution. The choice facing the Catholic Church is to modernize or continue to lose relevance. The time of talking snakes, originally sinful babies, and mysticism understood by illiterate fishermen but too convoluted for the educated modern man has passed. People are rejecting the spiritual guidance of a protectionist celibate boys only club whose history of hostility to change has had it come down on the wrong side of an arguement time and time again. Blind faith has run its course, in the age of reason, religion has to make sense. Christ's teachings are awe inspiring in their simplicity. In less then a hundred words, Christ challenges us to live a life humbled before God and dedicated to the service, love, and improvement of our fellow human. He expresses the enduring love of the Creator for the created. This message should be the focus of Catholic activities...not the rejection of medical insurance for responsible, often medically necessary, women's contraception. 

&gt;This topical issue is a perfect case study of what I am talking about. To allow the rhythm method but disallow chemical and barrier methods is illogical. Given the 100% efficacy of abstinence during fertile periods, the rhythm method is less open to life then either barrier methods (condoms break) and chemical means (failure of proper hormone dosing). To argue that the designs of the Creator of the Universe can be thwarted by a pill or a condom is kinda goofy. We don't profess that He is mostly all powerful. And yet, here is the Catholic Church digging in their heals and vilifying a perfectly acceptable means for people to be responsible in crafting the size of their families. 

&gt; I want to defend/embrace the Catholic Church and retain my ability to use reason and logic. The two are increasingly incompatible and the Catholic Church seems to never miss an oppertunity to force a choice between the two. Logic and science are the methodical seeking of truth, religion is the revelation of divine truths...they should be two sides of the same coin, not contradictory.

**Me:**
&gt;I'll preface this by say that, as ardent atheist, I normally do not comment on religious / faith based comments. But, you asked for input, so I figured I could comment. 

&gt;Bobbo stated the largest problem quite well - the church is absolutely incompatible with reason. I am not denying that many doctrines, beliefs, and leaders come from reason. But when the same conclusions can be arrived at without the church, why use it at all?

&gt;At the very root of any faith, is the idea that you can believe something \*without reason\*. That you should believe it without evidence, without proof at all. As is pointed out by Russell's Teapot, such nonsensical belief systems are valueless. 

&gt;The foundation of the church, the bible, is unreasonable. The book is littered with historical inaccuracies and internal contradictions. While it makes for great myth, it deserves no more place as a religious artifact than does any other cultural epic. 

&gt;\*\*\* From a reasoned perspective, any stance that supports barbaric customs (circumcision), fairy tale miracles, and ignores (or even hinders) the advancements of science, is a stupid one. \*\*\*

&gt;Additionally, as Bobbo and others pointed out, the leaders of the church lack credibility. Hypocrisy and corruption plague every level of church leadership. As some examples: 

&gt;• The church is one of the richest organizations in the world. One on the pope's finger is worth more than most will earn in their lifetime. Similarly, Ss. Peter and Paul's stained glass windows are easily worth millions. The church and its individual parishes hoard gold and valuables like this, instead of giving their resources to the poor, all the while claiming to be a 'Charitable' organization. 

&gt;• Parishes world wide have provided cover ups and relocation for priests accused of child abuse. For an organization self-proclaimed as ""The Way, The Truth..."", this is as starkly untruthful a response as is possible. 

&gt;• Vatican authorities are currently under investigation for money laundering and child abuse cover ups. In the midst of these investigations, the pope has the arrogance to call anyone leaking information from the church ""disloyal"" and ""cowardly"". 

&gt;• The church and its leaders are willing to nitpick when defending beliefs regarding homosexuality and abortion, but when the same bible-quoting strategy is used against any belief they claim ""it was not meant for literal translation"". 

&gt;As mankind advances, we no longer need mythology and fear mongering to hold us together. Morality can easily be found as a intrinsic human value, and is not rooted in any book nor organization. And while the idea of death is still fearful, no reasonable man needs heaven to be comforted. The authority figures in the church really don't serve a purpose anymore. In the past, the leaders served as educated representatives of the vatican / god, knowledgeable of the discussions that created catholic doctrine. Today, those discussion and dissemination of doctrines can be had instantly and include every single person on the planet. The time of a bureaucratic dogmatic patriarchy is past.

&gt;Mankind is growing, rightly, increasingly dependent upon science as a source of truth. While it advances, the church remains rooted in practices founded centuries ago. The flight from the church has only just begun - more and more people will become secular as the years go by. If the church stands any chance of ""bringing them back home"", it needs to completely change and challenge nearly every standpoint it currently holds. Barbaric traditions must be abandoned, and they must re-ground their foundations not in a book of myths, but in humanity. Jesus was a great philosopher (if he even existed), but a son of god? not within any stretch of reason. Sure, the beatitudes and commandments 4-10 offer rules standards for morality, but that morality doesn't come from a burning bush. Realistically though, any future church that will ""bring them back home"" will be a place of philosophic discussion and moral education, but not dictated dogma and barbaric, pointless tradition.

**Bobbo again:**
&gt;1984, here is where the agnostic and athiest part ways. There is no evidence contradicting the existence of a Divine Creator of all things. To affirm that God does not exist without evidence to support the same is, at the end of the day, just as unreasonable as to suppose His existence on blind faith. 

&gt;I am less concerned about the internal finances of the Church, due to having an incomplete tally of income versus expenses, then I am about your second point, the coverup by the leadership in the organization of sexual abuse. Although, at this point I believe the Church has incorporated mitigating factors, this situation has opened a Pandora's Box concerning the clergy's wisdom in matters of sexuality. I know nothing of the money laundering situation facing the Church, however obviously would not condone such activities if they are in place.

&gt;As for homosexuality and abortion. I see nothing wrong with a religion voicing its views on social matters. As a living being, it may be self serving, but I believe life is special. In a cold dark universe, matter and energy combined with purpose and agency appears thus far to be extremely rare. It should be valued, treasured. Science without ethics and morals is a dangerous thing. All manner of very dark things can be rationalized. The challenge to lead a better life and seek out self improvement, which any religion of value poses to congregants, pays dividends to society as a whole. To be against the idea of religion I think is to reject a facet of life from which great joy and peace can be achieved. To do so without empirically disproving the existence of a Divinity is to potentially cut yourself off from your purpose of being. In my mind, the athiest is just as irrational as those who blindly adhere to faith and tradition. To presume we are close to having this whole universe/existence thing figured seems a premature. With the data still coming in and much left unexplored, to conclude there is no God, seems to traverse the lands of hubris.

&gt;Man kind is growing, and each passing generation sees humans taking on powers and responsibilities tradtionally held by gods. The thunderbolt, the ultimate symbol of divinity in the classical Greek religion, now serves to power my XBox and illuminate my house. Imagine where we will be in another thousand years. Sons and daughters of God seems to be an ever more apt label for humanity. But in order to properly own that label, we need to wrestle with the ideas of right and wrong. The consequences of doing so couldn't be higher, and as a framework for engaging in this struggle religion has social value. 

&gt;As a baptized Catholic, I of course feel an obligation to Catholicism. The Catholic Church first introduced me to right and wrong. It was instrumental in educating my mind and introducing me to the concepts of there being things greater than self. And in so doing, I feel indebted not to individual Catholics, but to the institution as a whole. I want others to benefit as I have from the truths found in the Church's teachings. As it is a man made organization, filled with and administered by human beings, it is imperfect and needs to seek out its own imperfections and improve them. It has to be a living religion to be relevant. You can't be in the market of selling truth without ensuring quality control. This is anathema to some. Anytime doctrine is questioned, words like heretic are bandied about. This isn't unique to religion. Any culture feeling threatened by those who would pose questions can react poorly. The last words of Socrates provides a perfect case study. But the reality of the situation is, heretics of the time are often proved right when the jury of history makes its ruling. Martin Luther was alot more right then he was wrong, but at the time, there weren't alot in the establishment who would have agreed thus. And so I think it is fantastic to have a discussion, get people talking about what we believe in the light of day versus in incensed shadows. Let us examine our faith and see if what we profess makes sense. Let us hold our leaders accountable when they fail us. The more we do this, the more we can grow in our understanding, the less we do this, the greater our imprisonment to the ignorances of the past. 

&gt;And one final thing, I will restate, a jewish carpenter explained the secret to leading a fulfilled life to a bunch of uneducated fishermen in very few words and challenged them to live freely by those words. Christianity as a concept is not complex. It is not a mythology of rituals and edicts. Truely applying the words of the jewish carpenter is hard enough without trying to remember which feast day it is and whether it requires a Mass attendance and whether meat can be eaten and whether a scapular is being worn and whether and whether and whether...

**Me:**
&gt;Bobbo, I'm sure you are familiar with the idea of ""burden of proof"". The root of your first argument here is that any point of view is just as legitimate as any other. This is simply not true. For example, if I claim I can fly, you would ask for evidence. But if I claimed that I cannot fly, you would not ask for evidence. Such defense for god is making use of a logical fallacy known as ""argumentum ad ignorantiam"". When talking specifically about god, I again will cite Russell's Teapot as an exemplary explanation here. 
(I would also add: though it is, by definition, impossible to disprove god entirely, it is very possible to prove his lack of influence in the universe. See Laurence Krauss's ""A Universe From Nothing"".) 

&gt;You next points were more about religion as an institution rather than god specifically. I completely agree that religion institutions should voice their opinions on social matters. As philosophical educators, their voices and opinions can help less educated people understand the issues. But, voicing their opinions, and condemning their opposition are two different actions entirely. In the case of the catholic church, the rarely only voice opinions. As their history exemplifies, they are willing to kill millions in defense of their beliefs.

&gt;You also suggested that condemning religion entirely is rejecting part of life that brings joy and beauty. Again, I agree. Works like the sistine chapel, the poetry of the bible, etc. are invaluable parts of human history. But, just as you reject the beliefs of Roman Mythology, you still appreciate the beauty of the Pantheon and the imagery of the Odyssey. Taking this more modern, I recognize JK Rowling's fantasy world has great stories and even morality at its core, but you won't find me building a wand any time soon. I don't reject the beauty of religion, especially of the bible - it's contains some of the best epics ever written. There is a difference between rejecting it's preaching and authority, and rejecting its beauty. 
You failed to recognize that though religion is a source of beauty and peace, it is also a source of prejudice and violence. In your own church's history, we have seen several waves of Crusades, endorsements of slavery, payment for confessions, bought papacies, approval of Nazi germany, etc. Such flagrant and wide spread evils can only be accomplished under the guise of ""for god"". 

&gt;You also, shortly, suggested that life has a purpose/meaning. I disagree. The only purpose of life is to produce more life. I believe, you see another purpose in life. Again, this is another argument where the burden of proof lies with you. 

&gt;I again agree with you in your next point - that religion needs to adapt / change to maintain relevance. To this point, I again ask: why, in our modern era, when discussions about morality and philosophy happens globally and instantly, why do we still need religion? Religion just disconnects morality with its roots - instead of ""for the sake of humanity"" it becomes ""for the sake of god / heaven"". Worse though, religion brings with it flaws, and illogic: ""believing something without reason"". Utter nonsense that leads to further nonsense. 

&gt;Lastly, you point out that living by the words of Jesus is challenging. As a philosopher, he is hard matched - the beatitudes are still among the best, simplest pieces of moral direction even created. But, believing in him as a brilliant carpenter, versus as the son of god, are not the same. But, unlike what you claimed, christianity is more than believing just the philosophy of one man - it's believing the myths of lazarus, of the wedding at cana, and the resurrection. My respect for Jesus's preaching does not make me christian any more than my respect for Buddha's make me buddhist. If religion were merely a philosophy, I would be a very religious man. But it is much more than a philosophy, which is why I am so opposed to religion.

I simply do not understand the idea of a deity. Since there is a lot of conversation on reddit regarding the atheistic leanings of agnostics, I am curious whether atheists here would also classify ignostics as atheists. 

Since this is a debate subreddit, I will say a little about my thoughts on the matter. (I'm using Wikipedia definitions since I think this is the sort of topic that is best crowd-defined; please correct me if you feel I am wrong). It seems to me that a ""deity"" must be these things: 

* preternatural or supernatural

That's pretty much it. There are also the qualities of immortality and divinity, but the former doesn't apply to all gods and so is not worth considering and the latter is a circular argument. So basically, some entity that either exists outside of things that exist or seems like it does. Cargo cults are a pretty good example of why preternature would not seem to evince a deity, although, in the same vein, I would expect that, considering the size of the universe, there are very likely many beings with preternatural powers. The supernatural is a trickier beast, but I would argue that the nature of the limits of the natural is beyond our current understanding, which would make the natural itself supernatural, which would make the supernatural meaningless.

There is a possibility that all of the gods defined today are simply culture-specific metaphors that I don't understand, which is why I can't just not believe in any of them, because I totally accept the existence of preternatural things. Also, a lot of religious people seem happier than me which makes me think they could be onto something. Although it could just be from the social benefits of religion, I can't discount the effects of deity belief on attitude and mindset. I would certainly be willing to believe something unprovable if the belief had positive effects on my well-being.

So am I an atheist?

1326170222.0,14,self.DebateAnAtheist,oaebt,The fact that there are many interpretations of God in the world does not mean that God cannot exist.,DangerousIdeas,23,9,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/oaebt/the_fact_that_there_are_many_interpretations_of/,"There is a common argument that many atheists make in regards to the many religions that there are on Earth. There are many religions, including Islam, Judaism, Christianity, The Greek Gods, the Roman ones, etc. etc.. Many Atheists argue that because there are many different ""Gods"" and religions, how can we know which one is truly correct? Therefore, since there are so many interpretations, one cannot be considered the true one, no matter how many times its advocate argues that it is the true one. This seems logical at first--if everyone says their God is the real one, then maybe they are all wrong? 

However, this is simply not the case. Ironically, the same situation can be modeled after science. Since many of the phenomena we see today cannot be explained due to our limits (and technology's limits), there are theories that are made by many scientist. These theories (the most popular ones) seem to hold the same basic tenets, except with nuances on certain areas. Since none can be disproved or proved, we simply speculate on how practical and feasible that theory is. If it works well, then we give thought/experiment to it. However, we never shoot down any other theories; there could be another interpretation of an event out there that may be equally as possible and have its own merits. But just because we dont know what is happening, we do not dismiss the basic concepts within these theories.

Why are we not applying the same standard to religion? There are countless interpretations of God; as part of a trinity or Yahweh or Allah. They all have the same basic moral values and beliefs (monotheism, prophets), but just have their own particulars within their religions (which also share their own similarities, like Ramadan and Yom Kippur both involve fasting). They are all **theories** on the existence and nature of God/humans/the world. These theories cannot be proved, because there will always be an answer provided by these religions (i.e. we cannot simply say ""If God exists, then he will prove it by making it rain for 3 seconds!"".). So they will always remain theories about religion.

But then why do many Atheists press the notion that because there are many interpretations, there cannot be a true one and therefore the concept of God is false? The idea that a conflict of explanation automatically falsifies all explanations is absurd, especially in the scientific one. 

TL;DR The many religions in the world should be treated as theories (in science) about religion. They should not face the argument that a conflict with explanation automatically means all explanations are false. Just as many theories rise up but only one can be true, so can be it with religion.

**NOTE: Please, understand what this thread is about. I am NOT trying to prove the existence of God. I am NOT trying to say religion=science. I am NOT trying to say that religion should trump science in our understanding of the world.

This thread is to discuss the specific issue of the argument that many religions means no true religion. NOTHING ELSE PLEASE.

Naturalism generally accepts the following about the spacetime system:

A. It is causally closed  
B. Anything non-physical emerges from the physical  
C. There is no teleology  

Now, about the mind on naturalism:

   1. Beliefs, doubts, thoughts, etc emerge from configurations of electrons
   2. Electrons are moved around by the negative charges of other electrons
   3. Therefore, beliefs, doubts, thoughts, etc. have the values they do because of the movement of electrons before them, which have the configuration they do because of the movement of electrons before them, and the electrons before them, and so on all the way back to the Big Bang.

I.e., beliefs, thoughts, doubts, etc have the values they do because of mindless matter in motion stretching back to the Big Bang. If so, then they do not have the values they do because of rational inference.

Therefore, either:

* No belief, doubt, thought, etc is rationally inferred (including the belief in naturalism itself)

or

* One of the three tenets of naturalism above (A, B, or C) is false. I.e., either there is something else in addition to the spacetime system, the mind is dualistic, or teleology and hence meaning exist at a fundamental level.

Hi, me again with the crazy Buddhist-Christian dad. I'm working towards a license so me and my dad have had a lot of 1 on 1 time recently, and every time I hope I've settled it, but it keeps coming up.

Two points he brought up this time

* 1: He brought up the point that very small children have personalities and how could they if not because of who they were in the pre-existence. (I'm not sure if that idea is mainly a Mormon one or if most Christians share it, but i'm getting off topic.) I countered this by saying that it's because they can make choices even as very young babies. They can think that music is interesting, or just another noise. These aren't very deep thoughts albeit, but they are still thoughts that are the beginning of personality traits. He said ""They're both equally plausible idea's."" I dropped the subject for the sake of sanity.

* 2: Next he says that he had an experience in college where ""the spirit"" told him that he was going to get married in the next semester if he stayed, and lo and behold he was, my thought was that he had that thought and therefore worked towards it, even subconsciously, he called that idea ""ludicrous"" and that i was ""Denying evidence because it doesn't fit my vision of the world"" I knew that it wouldn't  

I again asked what he hoped to gain from the argument and he said that he wanted me to be to be open to ideas. I thought but did not say ""I WOULD if i had a provable evidence."" because when i asked him for some earlier he said that his testimony (He was thinking of it in the legal sense when he said it, oh I love Irony.) was proof enough.

I don't think i'm being too very ""out there"" with some of my reasoning, but i'd like a few more opinions, seeing as he won't take me very seriously due to my inexperience, which i can understand, but i'd like to think that i'm able to tell the difference between proven fact and convenient assumptions.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_1i9nn4,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1i9nn4/a_little_bit_more_help/,

See EDIT#2 below]


It's outlined pretty well [here](https://sites.google.com/site/roeflip/).

To make the argument in one sentence: The fetus deserves the fundamental right to life that we attribute to all human beings, and this right is greater than the right of the woman to control her own body.

A key distinction must be made between 'human being' and 'person.' I will concede that the fetus is not entirely and unequivocally a person. I think a decent argument could be made that it is, but ultimately it's a sort of continuum fallacy. The acceptance of the fetus as a human being is undeniable, though, in that it is a living member of the species Homo sapiens. Given this, it deserves at least some rights; at the very least it deserves the right to life.

This argument is only for the standard, run-of-the-mill abortion. I don't think it holds up in cases where the woman's life is in danger.

I'm interested to see what other atheists have to say about this. I'd like to hear arguments that don't rely on religion for a change.

EDIT: It's become clear to me that I have not thought out why human beings deserve the right to life. Any input on this is very much welcome, for or against. Peter Singer argues [here](http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/opinion/comment/analysis-why-it-s-irrational-to-risk-women-s-lives-for-the-sake-of-the-unborn-1-2467196) that ""Membership of the species Homo sapiens is not enough to confer a right to life."" If that is the case, then what is enough to confer the right to life?

---

EDIT#2: 

Alright, clearly this argument, as I put it originally, is not well-formed. I do not think it is because the argument itself is bad, although I concede my definition of human being was problematic; rather, I think I did not explain or understand it well enough. I'm going to try it another way, with a slight modification on my definition of 'human being.' The following are two sort of interrelated arguments. The first addresses the fetus's right to life; the second addresses the 'implied contract' a woman accepts when she engages in sex.

1. Society has determined that the intentional killing of human beings with some of the characteristics of personhood and/or the capacity for the characteristics of personhood is wrong^A except when another's life is in danger
2. A human being is a member of the species Homo sapiens that exhibits brain activity^B
3. The fetus is a member of the species Homo sapiens that exhibits brain activity^C
4. The fetus is a human being
5. The fetus exhibits some characteristics of personhood, such as being human, individuation, motivation, emotion, and awareness^D
6. The fetus has the capacity for all characteristics of personhood
7. The fetus is a human being with some characteristics of personhood and the capacity for all characteristics of personhood
8. The killing of a fetus is wrong by the standards of society except in cases where the woman's life is threatened^E

A: Take, for example, the hypothetical case of a living baby born then put into a reversible coma. That baby exhibits little or no characteristics of personhood, but I think everyone would agree that killing it would be wrong, no?

B: Admittedly, the definition of a human being was something I was unprepared for previously. I think, though, that this is the best definition. I can't come up with anything less ambiguous that doesn't include things like stem cells, dandruff, tumors, etc. Thoughts?

C: [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embryo#cite_note-6)

D: I can provide sources for these if you really want (Although it's sorta propaganda, the [Silent Scream video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gON-8PP6zgQ) can vouch for the last three). The point, though, is not to focus on these specific ones I mentioned. There is no consensus on the definition for personhood, but with any definition put forth, the fetus will display basic elements of at least one characteristic. This held up for every *decent* definition I could find. Some definitions were as simple as ""has memories,"" which is clearly an insufficient definition of a person.

E: One objection that this set does not address is the argument that the fetus is a 'parasite' that is feeding on the woman, who has the right to refuse that. I address that in the following argument. I think this one is less sound than the previous one, mostly due to the way I wrote it, but the basic idea is evident. I'll probably edit it for clarity eventually.

1. Consensual sex carries an implied risk of pregnancy^F
2. A woman understands that when she engages in sex, there is a chance of pregnancy, even when using birth control
3. Pregnancy involves the use of the woman's body by the fetus
4. A woman understands that when she engages in sex, there is a chance of the use of the woman's body by the fetus, even when using birth control
5. By engaging in sex, the woman accepts this consequence as a possibility
6. The fact that the fetus is a 'parasite' is not a justification for abortion because the possibility that the fetus will use her body is accepted by the woman when she engages in sex^GH

F: Consensual is a key word here, because it exempts rape from this argument. I still think that in cases of rape abortion is not entirely justified, but I won't bother arguing that here.

G: Because I don't think this is linked very well with the previous argument, I'll probably add something about the wrongness of killing the fetus overriding the bodily autonomy of the woman.

H: Because most people seemed to be arguing against the idea that the fetus deserves the right to life rather than the idea that the fetus's right to life is greater than the woman's right to her own body, I didn't devote as much time to ironing this one out. Of course, because of that, most new replies are going to focus on this one.


I hope this make my argument much more clear.

His general premise was that science is based on observation, and because our senses all have some kind of 'lag' (e.g. it takes time for light/sound to travel), it is impossible to state what anything currently is with absolute certainty. 

If I look at a wall and it appears blue, I cannot actually say that the wall *is* blue, I can only say with certainty that it *was* blue a tiny period of time before, as the light took time to reach me. We can then say that science cannot prove that humans evolved from simpler organisms, as we didn't directly observe it when it happened. This can also be expanded to big bang theory/ virtually-every-other-scientific-theory: if we were not there to observe it, then how can we be certain that it happened? 

Another point was that science is fundamental flawed, as it makes the assumption that what has always happened previously will always happen in the future. If science has only ever seen red fish, then it may be considered a scientific truth that all fish are red. But if someday a blue fish comes along, then their idea is proved completely wrong. Furthermore, it's currently a scientific law that heat flows from hot objects to cold objects. But, one day if heat is observed flowing from cold to hot, then the entire law must be wrong! 

I find this rather interesting, and I can't think of any knowledge that doesn't come from our senses.

I'm not really challenging as much as looking for information. 

I have a family member who recently turned to Refromation theology from supposedly an atheist worldview prior. He's attending a school to study his faith and has been doing a great amount of research in epistemological philosophy, induction, logic, etc. He asserts that though atheists can use logic, an atheist worldview can't account for logic, math, morality, induction or proofs. He claims that proving something doesn't actually prove anything (a very abstract idea) and that we can't just presuppose things. He is thoroughly convinced that atheism has no solid intellectual ground to stand on. 

I completely disagree, but can't find the philosophy to successfully counter his claims. I don't believe this makes him right. I think if we're talking about God, the burden of proof lies on the person who says God exists.  But to tear it apart at a basic level of how we infer truth and use logic and how that translates to an atheist worldview not being able to account for them doesn't make sense. To me, if logic and how we attain knowledge can't be known for sure to identify truth then everyone bases things either on ""faith"" or by their own best guess from probability. He states that the atheists actually borrows from the christian world view and that they will continue to until they have an answer for how ""universal abstract invariants"" can exist in their own.  I fail to see how atheists use just a christian world view to use laws of logic, math, science and morality. 

I think atheists (at least I do) base their world view on what can attribute to a clear and probable understanding in search for real truth. Maybe this sometimes pulls from society for morality, or number theory for logic and science. But how is this christian? I can see where ""christian values"" have been a part of society and so we might adhere to it because society has conformed to certain tennnants because they work and make sense. But math, science, and logic? How the hell does that have anything to do with a christian worldview? I don't see how the Reformed theologies use math, science and logic to infer there's a man in heaven watching our every move to judge your immortal soul when you die (how do you even get to there being a soul in the first place?) and that the bible is for a large part literal and historically correct. 

I hope this made sense, because toward the end it started to make less and less sense for me. If anyone can give some clarity to anything I've mentioned, it'd be greatly appreciated.

First of all I would like to say I am new here, and if I am using this subreddit wrong, please correct me and please excuse me.

My question to all of you is this:  When we as human beings observe some lesser life form such as a plant, we can see that the plant does not see, it does not hear, feel, touch, or smell anything.  However, this plant is still alive.  If you put a bee into a glass jar with the bottom of the jar open, the bee will run into the side of the jar over and over again until it dies.  It won't figure out how to escape.  Your dog at home doesn't seem to be able to tell if you have been gone for 5 minutes or 5 days.  So, all of these life forms are completely unable to even observe a part of reality that to us is very plain and simple.  We often think of ourselves as the epitome of creation, but, only because we have yet to come across a life form which is ""greater"" than us.  

Isn't it very possible that there is much, much, more to reality that is right in front of our eyes that we are just simply unable to observe? Even if there were just 5 other ""senses"" (for the sake of argument) wouldn't we be like a plant to the bigger picture?  Thinking we know so very much, but in reality, we don't know anything at all. Even current models of the universe as we understand it now project there to be many more dimensions than we can observe.

That point being made, isn't it likely that, viewing the extreme complexity and beauty that naturally arises in the world, it is not unreasonable to think that it didn't happen by accident?  To say for sure that there is no God, to me, seems arrogant because it makes the assumption that we could be able to answer that question in the first place, let alone to have one person figure out the greatest questions man has ever asked. (Why are we here? Where did we come from?  Is there meaning to all of this?)  While any ""theistic"" view at least aknowledges the fact that we are NOT able to know or observe all there is to be, and there is a much greater reality than ours.

How do you, as (an) athiest(s) address this issue?

I know someone is going to say this is an argument from ignorance, but I could say the same about athiesm.  We can't disprove (or prove) God, and don't know how the universe started.  Science is unable to address the supernatural so therefore, god isn't real and reality is some sort of fluke or entirely explainable and understandable existence. That is not a solid argument to me.

Also just to be clear: I am not arguing for the existence of any type of God established by any type of organized religion or cult, or general school of thought.  Just that the existence of something greater than us or supernatural OR, unexplainable is much more likely than most athiests seem to think it is.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_124pbs,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/124pbs/to_athiests_isnt_some_type_of_supernatural/,
1351045113.0,16,self.DebateAnAtheist,11zfj6,Is Atheist overexposure/extremism hypocritical?,TheBadAdviceBear,39,23,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/11zfj6/is_atheist_overexposureextremism_hypocritical/,"I don't think I'm the only one who's noticed this, but atheism, especially on the internet, has become pretty mainstream in modern society.  I've also noticed that atheism seems to thrive on a certain degree of hypocrisy that I don't recall it having not so long ago.  Maybe it's because I'm older and more aware nowadays, but I feel like it's been a somewhat recent trend for atheists (again, especially online) to publicly exclaim their lack of belief, as well as pressuring society as a whole to give up religious faith.

Now, I want to mention that I'm 18, Jewish, do believe in G-d (though not necessarily the Biblical one), attended Catholic school for four years, attended Sunday/Hebrew school until I was Bar Mitzvah'd at age 13, and have continued to study theology (mainly in a political/social context), and consider myself to be pretty much a social liberal.

That said, I have no problem with atheism, nor do I have problems with most religions (exceptions being things like the WBC or extremist evangelicals).  However, I DO have an issue with extremism, narrow-mindedness, and pushing your beliefs (or, in this case, lack of beliefs) onto others.

But that's just what I feel a lot of online atheism strives to do.  I think we can all agree, especially here, that religious people do some fucked up shit sometimes.  I think that we can also agree that they are a minority compared to devout observers of faith that believe in the better qualities of religion (i.e. community, moral values, expression of self, etc.).  Unfortunately, these extremists are often the most public figures when atheists make a stance for the evils or naivety of religion.

The point that I'm trying to make here, though, is that I think that, in large part, atheists are the ones who are helping to perpetuate this view of religious people as out-dated zealots.  This is because atheists, like religious extremists, can be overly vocal in their preachings.  I've been astonished by how many times atheists have made insensitive remarks about how dumb or pointless religion is while at the same time they present themselves as ignorant and arrogant.  From what I can tell, many atheists hold logic in high regard, but I can't be the only one who sees the hypocrisy in atheist extremism being almost as prevalent -- and in increasing numbers -- as religious extremism.

Please, help me explain why this is, and let me know if I'm in the wrong with my view on atheism/religion in modern culture.  Thanks in advance, and feel free to throw in some related opinions of your own, even if they're not directly relevant.

I've **grown up into an LDS household.** As it stands I have just recently graduated from high school, so the natural progressive step for me to take within that setting is **planing to go on a Mormon mission.** (For the few who don't know there is considerable pressure for 'every worthy, able, young man to serve a [2 year] mission.' at 19.) Like many of you I'm sure growing up into religious households, I've had my doubts about my denomination and faith in general. (Something growing into a more radical denomination hasn't helped with.)

But I fully plan to serve the mission. I understand my family and friend's belief, and, considering a Christian god is true, let alone the Mormon view of him, 2 years is an insignificant sacrifice. I'm mostly going though for myself. Even from a secular standpoint, being able to spend 2 years of my life on a veritable adventure sounds like a fair investment. On a mission you are intended to be 'immersed in the gospel', **I figure my mission to be the best time to legitimately look into my faith and decide for myself.** I'm just curious if anyone from the more atheistic persuasion find any inherent problem with this approach. Is 'brainwashing' inevitable if I so simply leave on it(something I can't imagine you to be able to support anymore than them declaring a god in general.). But, more generally, **is this a flawed approach of looking into my faith?**  *Now to the real question.*

I see all too many posts where more atheistic people fervently declare any sense of illusion beyond enjoying a piece of art to be some inherent injustice if not downright inhumane to not prevent. Some I see take it to a near evangelical extreme. I understand many have found themselves to be far more happier, nay, a to have broader sense of 'purity/completeness' that transcends mere 'happiness' once they abandoned their illusions. **Under what basis can you declare 'non/anti-illusion' as an inherent good anymore than someone under religion can otherwise?** In the proper circumstances, I can accept a certain level of illusion as even healthy. The more I look into it the more **I find myself leaning towards a centralist agnostic and even Buddhist outlook on the whole topic.** I'm just trying to get a litmus test for how many atheistic people are legitimately 'okay' with other's illusions.

Now I already know you're not all diehard evangelicals, or former altar boys trying to pick a fight. What I am curious about is how deep that, for lack of a better word, apathy goes down to for many. How many atheists could legitimately care less? **How many could even accept the basis of what they consider others illusions as non-harmful and even healthy.** (Something I understand might exist in many, but not under the scope of Abrahamic religion.) Or **is the mere basis of implausible faith always an inherent bad?**

Sorry, I can get long winded, if I lost my message in my pseudo-intellectual wordplay just let me know. **TL;DR content bolded.**

*EDIT*
Thanks everyone, this was my first venture into reddit discussions. I completely understand where everyone is coming from, mostly, 'cause I'm still partially there myself. I've been doing a lot of reading over the last few years, that have helped me understand a lot about religions, and why people do or don't believe in God. I eventually came across the writings of Allan Kardec on Spiritism, and after reading his books, I started making some connections that made sense to me, that somehow no longer allowed me to not believe. As I mentioned, I grew up atheist, but I was taught to judge people who believe in God as being weak, and that they needed religion to live their lives in a morally correct way. Does that make me weak? I don't know, but coming to God from the atheist perspective, it does one thing, it allows me to accept that everyone has the right to believe what they want to.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_qf386,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/qf386/what_if_everyone_worships_the_same_god/,

It's an argument I hear a lot in religious debates.

Some counterpoints just on the top of my head.

1. There are many quotations in books such as the bible that unequivocally supports hate, violence and subjugation. [For sexist quote on women, see timothy.](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Timothy+2%3A11-12&amp;version=NIV).

2. The basic tenets of for example Christianity, that cannot feasibly be subtracted from it, for example hell, subjugation to god, original sin, are in an of themselves ideas that lead to problems. If the punishment God sees fit for sinners is eternal burning, how can that be reconciled in the religious mind with tolerance and secularism? Also by believing in god you inevitably give up part of your critical thinking (you believe something without proof), with can facilitate other evils.

Anyone else have any arguments for and against this?

TLDR; I believe in God and say science is the way he works.  People choose what they want since God gave us free will. Organized religion is highly suspect. God is the goodness that we as people exhibit to one another. God is everything. Science proves the existence by showing us how everything works. 
Humans, we eat our own. 

I call myself Christian. I believe in God. I believe that Jesus died for me. I feel some people's POV is that God is a grey bearded wizard raising the dead, and swooshing down to save the ""good"" people. The other end of the spectrum is a group of people who say science is all and thus explains everything, and there is no proof of God, only science. 

I see God in everything. I believe science proves God's existence every day. Not ""God makes the sun rise, God blesses people, God is the reason that everything does what it does."" rather, I say, science explains how these things happen. Ok, I agree, I see the facts. If I say God is there doing that. Am I crazy? I don't run around preaching to people rather I say people should do what they choose to. 

God gave us free will. We are able to do what we want with it, it is ours. Humans are arrogant ignorant beings that lake humility in a self-destructive way. Science explains everything as we as humans understand it. We are so sure of ourselves that instead of being humble, atheists want to proclaim the ignorance of religious people. 

Some religious people deserve it because religion has been used throughout history to oppress, control, extort rape, murder, and steal, yadda, yadda, yadda. I think someone said ""God I love you, but I do not love your Christians.""

I have no faith in humans as a species since we eat our own. America is full of corruption at the top levels of government and big business is right there. The goodness that we put out to one another and living a good life is all that is needed to have a good afterlife not submitting to some religious organization that has been corrupted ever since human hands have gotten on it. 

To wrap up my wall of text, I want to ask… 




Edit:
What am I? What label do I fit under? To answer my initial question after a lot of helpful responses. Critique me more please. 

I see myself more as a person who believes a God did create the universe and our understanding of science and the processes that make things work were designed by God. At one point in history God was involved in the lives of humans. Jesus comes and goes. Some point God leaves us to our own devices. And here we are today. 

I can't accept the bible as 100% true but also know there is truth in the bible, that is logical and verified by third parties. I also accept that some humans as through our history hold malice and perform what we call ""evil"" acts. Sometimes these evil doers rise to position to cause large scale problems. Sometimes as direct and horrible as the Holocaust or more subtle things like influence the education of mass populations through deceit and half truths (The winner of a battle is the one who writes history) in order to support a minorities continued hold on power and protect it through twisting stories and establishing inheritance and theocracy. 

God is not the answer to the unknowns in life. I believe we humans could use more humility as a species, but we are also mostly good willed people with positive intentions. I believe absence of evidence is not evidence of absence (I took that from a redditor on another spot in DebateAnAtheist). I believe this because there is so much we don't know and don't understand. 

I have faith in a God but do not let that make retarded decisions like some farm animal(specifically politics and my view of other's personal choices). I am a sensible person that believes and accepts reason and logic when it is there but also accepts.

Now hear me out.

I've heard many atheists point to the holy crusades as evidence of religion causing human injustice and think there is some weight to that. However I also know that there were other factors that could have caused people to act out violently such as the black plague, famine, etc.

And in the case of the middle east, while yes there are Muslim Extremists committing violent acts. They also come from areas where there is little clean water, a cyclical culture of child abuse, lack of education etc.

To me this leaves the question open to whether religion is really the main issue that we need to focus on, or if it's a symptom that is going to keep coming back regardless of what religion is taking out of the equation. 

I am not asserting that religion is a symptom, but rather posing the question. I gather that human society is such a complex amalgamation of different unique individuals with their own sets of motivation and emotional impulses that I find it too hasty and believe it or not irrational to jump on religion as this independent causal agent.

Why do theists have problems believing that the universe was always there, in one form or another.  i mean, if they believe that god was always there, why not just the universe?

because my understanding of the big bang is:

at one point the universe was a massively dense spot, this dense spot had such huge pressure applied to its very core that the core itself ~~exploded~~ metric expanded creating what we call the big bang (kind of the opposite of a black hole).  this ~~explosion~~ metric expansion can even be measured today by measuring  expansion in matter.  this explosion coupled with the laws of attraction (magnetism, gravity, strong, week etc.) began to form what we now see.

i don't see how a theist couldn't understand this, why is that hard to grasp?

EDIT:  The way I see it, time is simply a measure of change, if nothing changes time doesn't exist.  The universe itself exists outside of time.

What all atheists share is the belief that all beliefs should begin with the null hypothesis. This null hypothesis can only be refuted with evidence (and evidence must be verifiable, reproducible, falsifiable, and empirical). This is word-for-word what science holds - ""the null hypothesis is true until there is evidence to the contrary."" 

If the two thought groups - atheism and science - begin from the exact same starting point - ""You must show evidence that disproves the null hypothesis"" - then how are they really different at all? How is science different from atheism if they both begin from the exact same starting point? On this thought train, if you haven't already disagreed with my premise, then if the two ideas of atheism and science are the same, wouldn't a blow to science, e.g. evolution being hypothetically disproved, be a blow to atheism?

My goal, really, is to get her thinking about what she truly believes and hopefully start giving her a chance to doubt some things; but I'd like to keep it friendly and insightful. The reason I'm posting here before I respond is because, while I'm heartfelt in my beliefs, I don't feel educated enough about her religious context and other basics to really give her a good response. Any starters/ideas would be greatly appreciated. Here is her response:

&gt;""First off, it's good to hear from you and I hope you are doing well as well! Life is good for me- graduated college in April and loving working at my first real job. I have to say I very much appreciate it that you messaged me and didn't comment on what I posted. Not that I would have minded if you had, but it shows to me that you were respectful and have a genuine interest in my thoughts. Obviously this is a widely talked about topic and also is a very sensitive one. I hope you don't mind if this becomes a long message but I think this topic justifies the length .

&gt;Let me give you a little background information on what my church believes. I think it might help you to understand their standpoint a little better. We believe that before this Earth we lived with God as Spirits in Heaven. He wanted us to become like Him, but in order for that to happen we had to come to Earth to receive a body and to be tested. We are being tested to prove to Him that we love Him and that we want to live with Him again once we die. Obviously none of us are perfect and God knew that. We would not be able to live with Him again on our own. So he sent his son, Jesus Christ, to pay the price for every person's sins.
Every person is given trials, challenges, temptations as part of that test. What's neat is that they are unique to each individual. Just as God blesses us with unique talents and interests, He gives us trials that He knows will help us grow and develop us into better people and more like Him. We also believe that we aren't given any kind of temptation that we can't handle. (1 Corinthians 10:13)

&gt;The church's standpoint on homosexuality is that it is one of those temptations that God gives us. The church isn't denying that those feelings aren't there for people or are in any way fake. What they're saying is just because you feel those feelings doesn't mean you should act on them. Let me give you an example. If someone is born with a short fuse, the individual might have angry thoughts but it doesn't mean he/she should act on such thoughts. The sin wouldn't be in the individual having those angry thoughts, the sin would be the words or physical harm that could follow those thoughts. Likewise with homosexuality- the thoughts are there for some individuals, but it doesn't mean those should be acted on. This of course stems from the belief that we believe that marriage is a sacred unit ordained of God and should only be between man and women.

&gt;You're probably thinking, ""a short fuse is nothing compared to homosexuality."" To some degree, I'd say you're right. It doesn't seem like an equal trial does it? It's something that I had to really take some time to really try to understand. I too, know people that are homosexuals and feel bad for the various judgments placed upon them. It's especially hard to be a religious person and to have same-sex attraction. Why do some people have to have the trial of homosexuality? It seems like one of the hardest things that someone would have to deal with in this life! But I eventually learned what's not fair is to discredit the hard things that other people have to endure. We all have our struggles- nobody can avoid them. But what right do I have to declare that my trials are harder than someone else's? Life is full of struggles that might seem unfair. Homosexuality just happens to be a challenge that society focuses on and is politicized. I think that the sad thing in that is that a lot of society is for accepting homosexual behavior and yet they define homosexuals by their sexuality. There is so much more to a person than that!

&gt;I think the purpose of the website is help people to be more understanding of the challenges that individuals face. God told us to love one another. We can do that without being supportive of the life choices that some people make.

&gt;If you have any other questions about this topic or about what I believe, I'd be more than happy to address those. I appreciate it because it gives me a chance to really dig deep on how I feel and what I truly believe.""

**Chapter 6 - Science Has Disproved Christianity**

&gt;Dawkins said very famously that ""although atheism might have been logically tenable before Darwin, Darwin made it possible it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist.""... He argues that you can not be an intelligent scientific thinker and still hold religious beliefs.  To support his thesis he points out that... only about 7 percent of American scientists in the National Academy of Sciences believe in a personal God.

&gt;the scientist must always assume there is a natural cause.  That is because natural causes are the only kind its methodology can address.  It is another thing to insist that science has proven there can't be any other kind... [that however] is a philophophical presupposition and not a scientific finding.

&gt;The other hidden premise is this statement ""miracles cannot happen"" is ""there can't be a God who does miracles.""  If there is a Creator God, there is nothing illogical at all about the possibility of miracles.

This chapter started out very frustrating.  He quickly extrapolates science to an extreme position it is not taking by playing word games, he then accuses science of 'presupposing' naturalism.  His counter to this mischaracterization of science is simply to presuppose God... 

&gt;To be sure that miracles do not occur you would have to be sure beyond a doubt that God didn't exist, and that is an article of faith.  The existence of God can be neither demonstrably proven or disproven.

Keller doesn't understand skepticism.   It gets worse though.

&gt;Evolutionary science assumes that more complex life-forms evolved from less complex forms through a process of natural selection.

*sigh*... I can't tell if Keller is deliberately dishonest with his diction or if he really is that ignorant on scientific subjects. 

&gt;When evolution is turned into an All-encompassing Theory explaining absolutely everything we believe, feel, and do as the product of natural selection, then we are not in the arena of science, but of philosophy.

So what exactly are you trying to argue Keller? 

&gt;Ian Barbour lays out four different ways that science and religion may be related to each other: conflict, dialogue, integration, and independence.

[Wikipedia link explaining the different relationships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science)

&gt;The conflict model gets... the most publicity.  [however] Smith argues that the conflict model of the relationship of sceince to religion was a deliberate exaggeration used by both scientists and educational leaders at the end of the nineteenth century to undermine the church's control of their institutions and increase their own cultural power.

Right...

&gt;Dawkins cites this statistic [7% of National Academy of Science believe in a personal god] as evidence that intelligent scientific thinking almost always leads to the conclusion that God does not exist.

&gt;To hold that a transcendent God created the universe is not enough to be listed as a 'believer'.

In a personal god.  Stop playing word games please.   Anyway what is your point? 

&gt;Sociologists of knowledge like Peter Berger have shown that our peer group and primary realtionships share our beliefs much more that we want to admit.

Ohhhh, peer pressure from fellow scientists.  Believing in God isn't cool in the National Academy of Science.  Great argument.  What else you got?

&gt;philospher Thomas Nagel... thinks Dwakins is wrong to insist that, if we are going to be scientific at all, we must embrace ""physicalist naturalism... that the ultimate explanation of everything must lie in particle physics, string theory, or whatever purely extensional laws govern the elements of which the material world is composed."" He asks, for example, whether we really believe that our moral intuitions, such as that genocide is morally wrong, are not real but only the result of neurochemistry hardwired into us.  Can physical science do full justice to reality as human beings experience it? Nagel doubts that.

So.. let me recap.  Your counter argument to an evolutionary biologist (Richard Dawkins) and neuroscientist (Sam Harris) on the subject of evolutionary biology and neuroscience come from a philosopher? Right... and the counter argument is 'misrepresent science' followed by 'Nagel doubts that'.   Actually lets let Keller sum up his argument thus far.

&gt;science cannot explaing everything, and [thats] why scientific thought can be compatible with religious belief. 

This chapter stopped being frustrating and started to become hilarious, it gets better. 

&gt;Christians who accept the Bibile's authority agree that the primary goal of Biblical interpretation is to discover the Bibilical author's original meaning... Psalms [Christians] read as poetry.  When they read Luke, which claims to be an eyewitness account (see Luke 1:1-4), they take it as history.

Good thing Luke doesn't have any historical mistakes.   But thats not what this chapter is about.

&gt;I think Genesis 1 is poetry... Genesis 2 is an account of how it happened.

Wait what?  So you just spent the entire chapter showing how science and religion are not in conflict only to admit on the last two pages that you are a creationist? 

&gt;Only after drawing conclusions about the person of Christ... should one think through the various options with regard to creation and evolution.

Exactly, first figure out what you want to be true and then bend science to your version of Christianity.

&gt;I'm sure that many reading this will be irritated that I don't take time here to adjudicate between the competing views.  For the record I think God guided some kind of process of natural selction, and yet I reject the concept of evolution as All-encompassing Theory.  

Well thats a realy wide range of possibilities. 

&gt;One commentator on Genesis captures this balance well:

&gt;*If ""evolution"" is... elevated to the status of a world-view of the way things are, then there is direct conflict with bibilical faith.  But if ""evolution"" remains at the level of scientific biological hypothesis, it would seem that there is little reason for a conflict between the implications of Christian belief*

Sometimes Catholics don't understand faith. Being an agnostic-agnostic with some understanding of theology, I once entered a heated discussion with a Catholic girl who claimed she was Catholic but didn't care if the Virgin Mary was virgin or not. I told her that the virginity of St. Mary is faith dogma, you simply must believe it to be a Catholic; either you are indifferent or you are Catholic but you can't have both. 

Faith doesn't need proof, does not need to make sense, a true believer does not care for reason, for faith is over any argument, faith is an agreement that's not negotiable. One could argue you don't need to be ignorant to have faith, and that knowledge does not dispel faith, will does.

So why is it that most Atheist arguments are always logical constructs, or scientific demonstrations, or moral puzzles  when a true believer is impervious to argumentation.?

Most religions aren't in an open market of whom has the most convincing arguments or who has the most compelling evidence. Religions are based on faith, a ""belief that is not based on proof"", or belief beyond belief.

So my point is I think if a person is already open to debate the substance of her beliefs then she already turned away from religion, and in counterpart an Atheist who debates such a believer isn't really debating a religious person, for that person has no faith and somehow I find that a sad excuse to keep arguing when there's nothing left to argue about.

I as an agnostic atheistist find myself convincing people of either truly believe in what they preach or leave the belief completely in equal amounts as I find no relevance in discussing e.g. the historical existence of Jesus, or whether God can create a rock he cannot lift. If you are already discussing that, you no longer have faith.

I'm not terribly familiar with Feser, although I read some of his blog posts. Anyone who is familiar with his arguments/are his books worth checking out? Anyway, here is what he said, sorry for the length:

 I realize that some concepts are difficult, especially if they're new concepts. But the fact that one may not completely understand those concepts does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that those concepts do not have concrete meanings. This is why Feser explicitly stated in the cosmo argument blog post, ""The reason is that, while the basic structure of the main versions of the argument is fairly simple, the background metaphysics necessary to a proper understanding of the key terms and inferences is not.  It needs some spelling out, which is why Aquinas and The Last Superstition each devote a long chapter to general metaphysics before addressing the question of God’s existence."" Now, you may take that as merely an advertisement for his books, but there are many other works (very in depth ones as well) that I could recommend and that Feser would recommend as well (just look at his recommended blogs and resource list on his sidebar). Regarding the notion that ""God's essence is his existence,"" while we may not fully grasp it, it certainly makes logical sense. And essence is ""what"" something is, or that in virtue of which something is, or a principle of intelligibility. Existence is ""that"" something is, or that something is in act. To say that God's essence is his existence is to say that God's essence and existence are identical so that he simply is, or is pure (complete/unlimited) act. Again, to more fully understand this and its implications, it's imperative that one do some study in the background metaphysics which simply can't be fully grasped via a few blog posts or emails. But there is nothing illogical or contradictory that is being discussed here.

Regarding the post I linked about the cosmological argument, he's not simply claiming people don't understand its subtlety, though that is part of it I guess. He's not even claiming that no one can refute the argument. He explicitly states the purpose of this particular post: ""The serious objections to the argument can in my view all be answered, but that too can properly be done only after the background ideas have been set out.  And that too is a task carried out in the books. I will deal here with some of the non-serious objections, though.  In particular, what follows is intended to clear away some of the intellectual rubbish that prevents many people from giving the argument a fair hearing.""

Feser actually responded to Rosenhouse in both combox comments and a couple of blog posts. If you're interested, the blog posts are here and here. To quote Rosenhouse as dismissing the cosmological argument doesn't really do anything other than show he dismisses the argument for various reasons that he lists.

Finally, I'm assuming you say, ""Were we to find even a single instance of something which didn't have a cause whatsoever, we know the claim of the cosmological argument is refuted..."" you mean if we were to find something that began to exist that didn't have a cause. Of course, if we were to find such a thing science would grind to a halt since science is essentially a search for causes. But even IF we found something that began to exist with no natural explanation, that would not affect Aquinas' arguments I don't believe. That thing's essence and existence would still be distinct since it began to exist. Its essence and existence would still need to be ""joined"" together so to speak. And it obviously wouldn't exist by nature since it began to exist, and the arguments from Aquinas demonstrate what a being who's essence and existence are identical entails. 

Now, you say that we empirically know that quantum mechanics demonstrate uncaused causes, again, assuming here you mean something beginning to exist without a cause, or from nothing. Why do you think that's what quantum mechanics shows? I disagree with that conclusion, but I want to here your take on it as someone who studies physics.

You say that saying there is a difference between the premises ""everything has a cause"" and ""everything that begins to exist has a cause"" is ""ridiculous"" and ""hair-splitting word games."" But this is certainly not the case. The two premises relate two entirely different concepts with two entirely different meanings. I'm not sure why you would think this is simply a word game. As any good philosopher, or scientist for that matter, knows, one must be accurate in what they are stating and studying. ""Everything has a cause"" and ""X has a cause"" are not remotely the same thing.

Edit: My 'encounter' went like this. 
I was sleeping downstairs with my brother and sister on the floor because we all were arguing for the couch, and since we never came to an agreement we decided it would be fair if we slept on the floor. My bro was 8, my sis was 7, and I was 14 at the time. At around 3:20 I woke up and saw that my brother and sister were sound asleep, so i figured I would go to the couch and sleep there. I laid down on my stomach with my face facing the back rest of the couch and my left arm was dangling down from the couch. I slowly started to close my eyes when all of the sudden I feel this tight grip on my arm. Like someone was squeezing my arm tightly. I opened my eyes in shock and slowly turned around. My brother and sister where in the exact same spots 5 ft away from me. I remember saying ""alright alright I'm going back down to the floor"" cause I was freaked out.. I can't help but think something grabbed my arm.. a ghost. But since I was soo tired, maybe I had imagined it? Maybe half asleep and half awake. Although I would say I was more awake than asleep. That would be my encounter, along with the many sightings I have seen in that house.

Your feelings, though, don't answer the question as to why faith and religion so dogmatically hang on when the world is flooded with more and more science and understanding of the universe around us; to include smart, well-educated believers.
&gt;
&gt;Take myself. I have a Master's of Science in Engr, yet my personal experiences, evidences, if you will, tell me that there is a Supreme Being out there. Things I have seen and felt, personally, that I cannot deny. These evidences are truths to me. Faith only fills in the gaps of things that I haven't yet experienced, but expect to in the future. True religion will never conflict with true science.
&gt;
&gt;I don't expect you to suddenly have a belief in God based upon what I'm typing here. However, my belief is based on a scientific method: I had a question, formulated a hypothesis, performed experiments, received results, and analyzed the data. The result for me was life changing. Just because you have not yet experienced those results doesn't make mine any less true.

I'm drafting a reply. I know the general structure of what I'd like to say, but I thought a little community input could help strengthen it:

............................................................................................ 

I have separate, but closely related, feelings and thoughts about religion and faith. I'll focus this reply on the latter. While I'm sure that neither of us are likely to sway the others opinion too much, there are a few points I'd like to address. 

- Why does religion still exist today? A lot of really complicated reasons. Probably outside of the scope of a little facebook post like this. But it is on the decline (source). I don't think humanity will ever be completely free of religion and superstition; we just aren't that great at critical thinking. We're too easy to trick.

- How do intelligent, well-educated, critical thinking people (such as yourself) still hold on to religion? People are really good at compartmentalization (source). 

-  Personal experience is a really really terrible, weak, untrustworthy kind evidence. (source) The human mind is really good at tricking itself. Good evidence need to be replicable, so outside observers can vet it. Every step of the scientific method, from the hypothesis you form, to the way you analyze the data has to be open to scrutiny.

- This is probably the most contentions point I will try to make: True religion (faith) and true science are fundamentally in conflict. What can be discovered through skeptical inquiry and rigorous scrutiny requires no faith to believe; claims which require faith are by definition outside the scope of true scientific thought.

Are there any better ones I should know about that actually make a worthwhile point to debate? please explain them in your own words so that the readers don't have to sift through a wall of awkwardly phrased biblical text. 

edit: to clarify, I was kind of hoping for more than just a list of questions like ""how many sons did billy have? genesis says 5, exodus says 6"". many people I find myself debating accept the bible as allegory so these contradictions don't really help me.

1321000738.0,11,self.DebateAnAtheist,m8iv4,My reasons why faith is rational! ,agnijd,38,27,187,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/m8iv4/my_reasons_why_faith_is_rational/,"Note: This is a rough draft of my argument for why faith is rational.  I suppose I will learn many more insights into how other people think and so plan to refine this argument based on what I learn from everyone.  Thanks in advance for your thoughtful replies.  


I don’t understand why atheists think faith in God is irrational.  I think it’s quite rational and I will try to explain.  Please note, I’m not going to prove God exists.  I’m attempting to explain one reason why faith is rational.  

If we consider the universe that we live in, we could come to several logical explanations.  The universe could have always existed.  The universe could have had a distinct beginning.  The truth of the matter is that we just don’t know.  At this point, the atheist will default and say,  we don’t know, and it’s not logical to make up some God.  I disagree.  If it turns out that it is more likely that the universe did have a beginning, then we arrive at a dilemma.  

Our natural world teaches us that, if not all things, then most things that happen are caused to happen.  If we apply this rule of thumb to the origin of the universe, then we could say that the universe was caused. And if there were a time that the universe did not exist, we have an interesting time trying to think about how something was caused when nothing existed.  The fact is, our current understanding of the universe does lead us to believe that it did, indeed, have a beginning; that there was a time when it wasn’t.   Is this a fact?   Well, it is a strongly established theory with empirical evidence to support it;  So, we end up with an unknown having caused the universe and everything in it.  We end up at this point through logical thinking that aligns itself with science.  

So the next question must concern this “unknown cause”.   We could defer, and say we just don’t know and appeal to future knowledge.  And I suppose that is a fair route to take.  But this is not the only route.  The other route is to appeal to some unknown power that exists outside of nature, which I will at this point on refer to that as God.  

Why is this a rational  route?  Because this conclusion is not reached by fanciful thinking.  We are actually pushed into this corner due to the nature of the dilemma; which I will remind you is as follows: the universe exists while evidence suggests that, at one time, it didn’t… and most things have a cause. 

I always hear atheists say there is no evidence for God and that faith is irrational.  To continue making an appeal for evidence (when it’s the evidence of the universe that leads us into a series of questions that allows us to infer a God) is not convincing, quite deceptive and/or ignorant.  

All of the above does not prove God.  But it provides a rational basis for faith.  As a side note, contrary to many atheist’s opinions, Christians are not against science.  The basis for faith as I have explained, places this ‘cause’ outside of nature.  Science can’t find God.  He’s not where they are looking.  Also, being outside of nature,  beyond our natural realm, existing before time even began, where time did not exist, logically leads to the break down of cause and effect, eliminating the need for God to have a cause, resulting in infinite regression.  

Edit:  Sorry, I'll add paragraphs next time.  Thanks for all the replies.  I do plan to review all the replies and rework my argument.  After a quick read, I can see I need to address a few topics in more detail.  

I also notice that the tone of some of the responses seems to ask me for proof for God.  I stated from the beginning that I am not attempting to prove anything but ""one"" reason for faith; I see a big difference between proof in God and reason for faith. I will have to address this in the future.  

I also notice a lot of focus on secondary questions, like: Ok, so you've argued for a cause, but is it sentient, etc? These are valid questions that have other answers. In my opinion, my argument doesn't answer such questions.   My intent was to focus on the riddle of how the universe can exist if at one time, it didn't...proposing that an appeal to an unknown realm (call it the supernatural or beyond nature) is a sufficient inference.  Though there are many thought provoking replies here, I feel a lot of what some people have written applies to future questions and so does not address the issue.  This, in my opinion, gets off topic and confuses the issue even though they are the next, logical question. I guess that's the problem...an appeal to such realm necessarily involves such questions.  Other reasons for faith answer some of these secondary questions.  It just gets too cumbersome to include all answers in one post.  That's what books are for. 

**Edit 2:**  Another theme I notice popping up is the concept of time.  I am quite aware of the idea that before the big bang, or before the universe existed, time does not exist.  Unfortunately, our language presents a problem when discussing this topic.  I thought this was understood and did not mention it in my OP.

Edit: I realize now I should have addressed this to anti-theists. You atheist cats are alright. 

Edit: I have quit responding to comments because it would seem I did not make my point clear from the beginning.  Everyone is hung up on my statement:  "" a belief in god and adherence to a moral code.""  I should have said ""a belief in god and adherence to the moral code laid out by said religion.""  My point isn't that without religion we would have no moral compass.  My point is that with so many people hating religion (especially those that cruise r/atheism) I began to wonder if all the hate was justified.  Is a belief in god and the culture that grows around that belief a net negative to society?  Sure, denying gays their rights or wanting our leaders to squeeze religious doctrine into politics, or starting religious wars is deplorable.  But what about the charity, sense of community and purpose that stems from religion?  Do those not outweigh the negative?  I don't know.  

As a Christian, I personally hate religious organizations because, generally speaking, they remove the need for God.  They tell people that adhering to a religious doctrine is more important than the inner speaking of God.  Religion is man made, and according to the Bible, will ultimately be destroyed (religious Babylon).  I've heard this many times but it bears repeating (even if my audience is atheists and anti-theists):  Religion is something done for God without Christ.  It is vanity, worthless in the eternal sense.  But does it do more good than harm to society as an institution?

And, of course, since scientific method is too limited to address spiritual issues, and that is the only source of evidence that you will accept you're always assured that you will win the argument.*""

I wondered whether an agnostic atheists are justified in their position. I think they are. Here is my take on it.

Consider the following premise:

(1) ""If we cannot understand the essence of god, then it's impossible to make any logical argument about it, or any that may follow.""

Assuming (1) to be true, it logically holds for all people, including religions authorities (pope, etc.) and scribes. Therefore, we cannot believe any of them or any of their works (teachings, writings, etc.).

We cannot even discuss or interpret the will of said god, for it cannot be understood. It's futile.

Alternatively, consider the following premise:

(2) ""If we can understand the essence of god, then it's possible to make any logical argument about it, or any that may follow.""

Assuming for the sake of argument that (2) is true. However, arguments about the essence of god (deductive or inductive) lead to logical inconsistencies and contradictions. Since the existence of contradications contradict the idea that it's possible to make any logical argument about the essence of god, (2) is either false and we are back to argument (1).

Or it holds that logical inconsistencies and contradictions are correct conclusions of arguements about the essence of god. Since an inconsistent and contradictory being cannot be real, god does not exist.

(3) Therefore (from 1 and 2), I'm justified to believe, there is either no god or we cannot make any logical arguments about its essence. Either way, I'm justified to not believe any claims about the existence or the will of any god.

I'll just be playing theist temporarily to provide an opponent. 

**Constants**: There are several physical constants that must *all* fall within a very narrow range for life *in any form* to exist. Many of these are independent of one another, such as the amount of entropy, the expansion speed of the universe, the gravitational constant, etc.

**Anthropic principle**: Doesn't address the issue. Essentially states that ""if observers evolve in a universe, it is highly likely they would observe a universe that is finely tuned for them."" The issue in question with fine-tuning is of the likelihood of a finely-tuned universe existing *at all*. 

[Douglas Adams' puddle](http://butdoesitfloat.com/260223/Puddle-thinking): The fine-tuning argument would be if the puddle discovered that it is highly unlikely that a pothole would exist at all. At that point he *might* gain some justification in wondering why his hole exists in the first place.

**Premise 1**: *The fine-tuning of the universe is due to physical necessity, chance, or design*

Seems to exhaust all the possibilities. Most others you can think of would probably fit under one of these three. Also, Hawking himself seems to provide these three choices as well: ""Most physicists would rather believe string theory uniquely predicts the universe, than the alternatives. These are that the initial state of the universe is prescribed by an outside agency, code-named God. Or that there are many universes...""

**Premise 2**: *It is not due to physical necessity*

Even in candidates for the Theory of Everything, there is nothing that uniquely predicts our universe. Plus, many of the constants do not have a connection between each other, such as the amount of entropy and the gravitational constant. Hawking: ""Does string theory predict the state of the universe? The answer is that it does not. It allows a vast landscape of possible universe, in which we occupy an anthropically permitted location.""

**Premise 3**: *It is not due to chance*

The chances of these values all falling into this one range is so great that the chance hypothesis can be dismissed outright. At least, on a single universe theory. What about a multiverse, where you would have an infinite number of shots at a finely-tuned universe?

One problem with the multiverse theory is that there is no evidence it exists at all. In addition, on a multiverse scenario it is much more probable that we should be observing a much smaller universe, or even a [Boltzmann brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_brain). And third, the multiverse would itself have to be finely tuned in order to produce multiple universes as well, some of which are capable of life, and thus only serves to move the fine-tuning up a level.

**Conclusion**: *Therefore, the fine-tuning of the universe is due to design*

**Premise #1**: *Everything that begins to exist has a cause*

True at first sight by intuition. Things don't pop into existence uncaused out of nothing. Out of nothing, nothing comes.

Virtual particles apparently pop into existence without any prior cause. However, this only happens on the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; on most other interpretations (for instance, many-worlds), virtual particles and beta decay are fully deterministic and thus preserve the causal principle. And even if they were indeterministic, they come into existence from the fluctuating energy in the quantum vacuum, which is not nothing.

Other than the above contentious points, the causal principle is confirmed over and over again in science and is one reason science has been so successful.

**Premise #2**: *The universe began to exist*

Four sub-arguments support this:

1. [Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_paradox_of_the_Grand_Hotel) shows that an actual infinite leads to paradoxes, and thus, an infinite past is impossible

2. An actual infinite cannot be created with successive addition. Placing one event after another will be forever finite. Thus, saying the past is infinite is like saying that you just got finished writing down all negative numbers

3. The Big Bang model, with the universe beginning in a singularity, is still the most successful one. But even on other models, including cyclic ones, the singularity continues to rear it's ugly head. See [Borde 2003](http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v90/i15/e151301) for more.

4. It has been shown that at least some entropy carries over even in cyclic models, and so if the past were infinite then the universe would have died a heat death an infinite amount of time ago.

**Conclusion**: *Therefore, the universe has a cause*

*Conceptual analysis of the cause:*

Since space, time, matter, and the laws of physics were brought into existence, then the cause of this must be external to them and thus spaceless, timeless, non-physical, and ""supranatural.""

Also, the cause must be personal, for the following reasons:

1. There are two types of (known) causal explanations: scientific and agent. The cause cannot be scientific as the laws of physics did not exist yet. Therefore, the cause was that of an agent.

2. Only two things fit the description of a non-physical entity: abstract objects and minds. But abstract objects cannot cause anything. Therefore, the cause was a mind.

3. A timeless cause would lead to a timeless effect. An impersonal cause existing from timeless ""eternity"" would also have it's effect existing from ""eternity"". But the universe came into being a finite time ago and thus, must have been willed into existence by a free agent.

Therefore, the cause of the universe is a spaceless, timeless, immaterial, supernatural, personal agent.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_e1jtf,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/e1jtf/argument_2_for_gods_existence_kalam/,

What I mean by this is that no other species has the technological advancement, or as far as we can tell the brain power that humans have.  So my friends were implying that there may have been sort of outside influence that raised humans up, but I argued that we were merely products of evolution that fulfilled a niche environment and killed off or survived over other potentially intelligent competitors early on(such as neanderthals).

(First posted in r/DebateReligion, but I'm interested in hearing what people over here have to say as well)",simism66,16,4,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1efl9s/can_god_be_naturalized_first_posted_in/,"First, a different sort of question:  How do we know that beliefs exist?  Well, we can have them, argue for them, doubt them, and object to the beliefs of others.  They make up an important and graspable part of our world, and so it seems silly to doubt that they are real.  But what are they?    It was once held that they were part of an immaterial mind, made of mind-stuff completely different than the physical world.  When this dualistic view was called into question, many thought it could be replaced with a view of beliefs as neurological states (as identical to brain states) or as psychological states (mental states which are completely reducible to brain states).  Paul and Patricia Churchland argue that, as a psychological or neuroscientific concept, beliefs are naïve and have little explanatory force, and the more we find out about the brain, the less of a role beliefs will need to play in these sciences until they are eliminated from the science of the mind entirely.  

Suppose the Churchlands are right.  Does that mean that there are no beliefs?  No, there are still beliefs—it just means that we’ve made another mistake as to what sort of thing beliefs are.  The psychologistic notion of belief must just be replaced with another thing that fulfills the same function, otherwise the Churchlands’ position would be self-defeating (how could they defend something they don’t even believe?).  (I think an articulation of belief as a socially-instituted normative status, as Robert Brandom offers, is the right route to take with replacing the psychologistic notion, but that’s beside the point.)

At one point, the immateriality of beliefs was probably thought to be essential to their existence.  At another point, their status as psychological states was held to be essential.  I don’t think either of these things are essential to their being real things.  What is essential is that they play the role beliefs play—that they mark our commitment to a position we may argue for, doubt, etc.  Whatever sort of thing they end up being, physical, non-physical, psychological, social, they must fulfill these essential roles, and if they do, they’re beliefs.

Just like the status of beliefs as psychological states is inessential to their existence *as beliefs,* is it possible that the status of God as a *supernatural entity* is inessential to his existence *as God?* (Of course, I’d use an un-gendered pronoun if there was a popularly accepted one.  I’d also probably use a pronoun which is neither purely personal (like “he”) nor wholly impersonal (like “it”), but such a pronoun isn’t available either, so I’ll just stick with “he.”)  

With atheists, I think that anything explicitly supernatural about the concept of God, that is not ultimately dependent on some sort of material stuff, has got to go.   But perhaps we can get rid of an idea of God as a supernatural “man in the sky,” and still say that “God exists” if what we are calling “God” still fills the same role that it used to.  Certain Christians, particularly associated [liberal Christianity]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Christianity) and [Christian existentialism]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_existentialism) have already suggested some naturalistic-friendly conceptions of God, that still try to retain the essentials of Christianity enough to be called the Christian God.  The judge of whether these conceptions can function *as God* is, I think, whether the sorts of religious practices can be genuinely and meaningfully done when God is thought of this way.  I’m not embedded enough in religious tradition (having become atheist from a relatively young age) to say whether a naturalism-friendly conception of God can fulfill the traditional roles, but people much more immersed in tradition such as the bishop [John Robinson]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._T._Robinson) certainly think so.

The majority of people on this planet are theists, and with religious tradition being very central to many of their lives, often tied to culture in a very inextricable way, it seems hard to believe that God could just drop out of their understanding of the world.   I think it would be a very sad thing if all religious traditions died out because much of the culture of the world is so intimately tied to religion.  That being said, my metaphysical outlook commits me to a broadly naturalistic picture, and I do hope wide-scale agreement on this basic view of the way the world is can be a possibility for the future.  Since I'm thinking that, to most theists, the religious view of theism is much more important than the metaphysical view of super-naturalism, I'm hoping we can keep the former and drop the latter.

Any thoughts on whether this is possible, or even coherent? 

Edit:  I should note that by ""naturalism"" I mean a very broad form of *supervenience* naturalism. So I believe that all sorts of things like hunger, fun, talent, oppression, brevity, intelligence, and objective normative laws (I'm actually a moral realist), are *real* in any meaningful sense of the term, but that they all are broadly *dependent*  on (supervene on) physical stuff.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_1efl9s,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1efl9s/can_god_be_naturalized_first_posted_in/,

One of his other points is that the entire book of Genesis should just be considered a metaphor for creation. I wonder if this idea has been lost through time somehow or for some reason.

However, he sent me one last message full of hate that does respond to what was said in the last thread.

(start of message)


Treating fools as what they are is absolutely called for. Christ did the same with the fools of his time and so do I.

I don't understand where you get the idea that all I did was insult. I suggest you read it again. This time note the numbers of the points where I have NOT included a rebuttal from the point of view of science or maths.

Don't bother. I'll do it myself.

Point 1. Refuted by my list of eminent physicists that were Christians contrary to the fool who could only cite Dyson - and even then he lied about him (as I gave a quote from Dyson himself). 

Point 2. No evidence provided for the claim. Claim dismissed.

Point 3: Refuted by my citing dozens of constants when your 'eminent spotty geek' stated there were 'only a few' .

Point 3 cont Realised the person could not respond.

Point 4. I asked for ONE piece of irrefutable evidence that is repeatable and verifiable that proves multiverses exist. 
I'm still waiting. Point refuted. 

Point 5"".Point refuted by explaining the Anthropic Princile further - stating that 'compensating' constants are no argument and gave the reasons why.

Point 6. Carbon. He cannot refute it so he insults. I've already explained the reasoning regarding carbon.As he did not even attempt to refute my point (no doubt he couldn't do so) then there is no need to rebut his refutation. How can I if he doesn't even touch the topic?

Point 7. Follows on from point 6.

Point 8 Rebuttal of this insult by asking why, when he claims that two alternatives are not appropriate, why he doesn't offer himself a third, fourth or fifth alternative. That is reasonable. But of course there isn't any other alternative or he would have cited it. Point refuted.

Point 9. I pointed out the idiocy of this remark, citing Jewish scripture (their 'holy books') outlining the beliefs of Judaism proving that YHWH was never thought of as NOT eternal. Point refuted.

Point 10. Refuted using Einstein himself

Point 11 Ignored as this was merely an insult.

Point 12. Ignored as this was an obscene, obnoxious insult. Interesting how you feel that I have insulted, when you cite filth like this? 

Point 13 Asked for ONE repeatable test that has been done that proves multiverses exist, I'm still waiting. And I pointed out the straw man argument here. Point refuted. 

Point 14. Probability clarified, and point refuted .

Point 15 . Error in what probability means and its calculation explained with actual figures. Point refuted. 

Point 16. I pointed out the fallacy of the 'cards' illustration. A corollary of point 15 which was refuted - with mathematical evidence.

Point 17. 'Not knowing' when the facts are staring you in the face is a euphemism of 'not wishing to have to admit'. Nothing to refute here because most of this point was an insult directed towards me.

Point 18.Refuted and this contributor pointed out as either mistaken or a liar.

19.Point refuted using Einsteinian relativity. 

20. I was asked for my qualifications so I gave them. No doubt you will now say that I was bragging. But if I hadn't given them you would no doubt then say that I was a liar. So on balance I did as asked. 

21. Explanations given as to why I retired early, despite it being none of your business. This contributors libelous lies and insults utterly refuted. Another straw man argument (re Creationism) refuted. 

As for 'casual insults being uncalled for' , I suggest you read the following:
"" mr timecube""
""read: got fired for trying to push creationism in public schools""
""This guy is SERIOUSLY not worth the time of day.""
""He's so incredibly full of himself ""
"" just keeps repeating the same kind of crap ""

and a particular favourite of mine:

""Fuck these silly goddamn beliefs and shitty illogical arguments.""

... and all these insults in the first response to my email you posted where the ONLY person I spoke negatively of was Richard Dawkins.

Let's take one of the quotes above: """"This guy is SERIOUSLY not worth the time of day."" That applies to you. Frankly I have spent far more time than I should have with you. You argue black is white, you side with obnoxious foul-mouthed ignorami (""""Fuck these silly goddamn beliefs and shitty illogical arguments."") rather than think for yourself, and you have the nerve to reply to me again with a load of lies regarding my last message despite the fact that I told you that I did not want any further response from you

So I suggest 

1. You apologise for stating that all I did was insult in my rebuttals in my last email

2. start growing up and thinking for yourself, rather than putting your faith in braindead saddos that spend their sad lives 'debating' something that they don't even believe in in the first place.

I think I'll go off now and spend a good few hours arguing that the (probably) fictional character Robin Hood really did marry the almost certainly fictional character Maid Marion. Absurd? That's exactly what you are doing it seems as you regard God as fiction and yet you seem to spend a heck of a lot of time debating Him, and seeking reinforcements from equally illogical sad disbelievers when the going gets tough. As i daid before, maybe He's trying to tell you something.

But I will make one thing clear. Send another obnoxious message, full of lies, and you will be blocked.

“If god is omniscient and omnipotent, he/it knows EXACTLY what will convince me and what won't. And he chooses to withhold it (or doesn't exist).”

So, why is it not possible that He gives them objective signs, empowers them to take responsibility,  to decide based on the available data, and own the consequences of their choices?

1345112611.0,12,self.DebateAnAtheist,ybbbu,How do positive atheists avoid theological non-cognitivism? ,gnomicarchitecture,27,15,163,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/ybbbu/how_do_positive_atheists_avoid_theological/,"**TL:DR ""God does not exist"" seems to be a very hard thing for most positive atheists to believe because it's hard for them to cash out what a ""perfect being not existing"" would mean, since perfection is vague, probably non-existent, and science has a hard time talking about every quality god has to the highest or lowest degree.**

Positive atheism is the thesis that no God exists (as opposed to negative atheism, which is simply the lack of belief in Gods and not a belief itself. I will use the term ""atheist"" in this thread to refer exclusively to positive atheists). Theological Non-Cognitivism is the thesis that statements about things like ""God"" are meaningless, and so positive atheism is impossible because positive atheists believe the meaningless sentence ""no God exists"". I will be interested here in how positive atheists can plausibly maintain their cognitivism about God. 

Positive Atheists usually aren't semanticists or philosophers. For that reason, I think they usually hold to a common sense, basic definition for the natural language term ""God"". That is:

A supreme being who created the universe. 

On this definition, it seems pretty clear how someone can believe that no Gods exist, they simply believe the following sentence is true:

There is no supreme being who is such that they created the universe. 

Although this is ambiguous. Does the ""there is no"" take wide or narrow scope here? Are atheists saying that there may be some supreme beings, but none of them are universe creators? Surely this is not what they are suggesting. They want to say that there simply are no supreme beings at all, regardless of whether you think they create universes or not. More simply, then, atheism is the denial of supreme beings on this construal. 

But what is a supreme being? Presumably an atheist might say ""well you know, a perfect being. A being that has maximal greatness"". Presumably the atheist doesn't want to take *necessary existence* to be a great-making property here, because that would instantly show that they think said beings necessarily exist (e.g. the ontological argument). Presumably they mean something less abstract. Perhaps God is the smartest, the wisest, the coolest, the friendliest to them. Presumably god is the least evil, the least mean, the least bitchy, the least etc. for any bad properties. For god is the g-ist and the least e-ist where g is any good property (besides necessary existence) and e is any bad property. 

Assuming the atheist can provide some objective criterion on which to distinguish good and bad properties (e.g. assuming moral naturalism), we can then ask whether there could possibly be such a being. Presumably, for any good property g, if a being has g do the degree d (where d is an element of the natural numbers), presumably that being could have g to d+1, or d+2, and so on, right? Couldn't god always have *more* happiness? *more* coolness? *More* love? This seems to be a common thesis, that there is never too much of a good thing. If this is true, then it's not clear how the Atheist's God here could be possible. However, stipulate that there was a highest level of goodness for g-having, a ""perfection"" attainable by a being if you will, presumably atheists are going to want to say most of these nice good properties are natural (happiness, lovingness, so on). If they are natural, then they are going to be physical, biological or whatever. Presumably there would then be a theory of God's good properties deducible from psychology or the other sciences. However, there is *no* theory in science right now (and possibly ever) that even logically permits a being with all of the max levels of good and lowest levels of bad. Or at least, it would take a *huge* amount of work on the part of a scientist to develop such a theory, as the theory would have an infinite amount of theorems in it. Barring that such theories are possible the atheist is going to have to say that God's inconceivable, and hence, it's not coherent for him to ""not exist"" or ""exist"".

I've already gone on too long, but I hope I've given some considerations as to how the seemingly most popular characterization of positive atheism, which takes God to be a supreme being, has lots of problems. I take the more complex varieties, which take God to be omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent, to be even more troublesome, and will post about those in the comments if need be.

If I had to choose I'd say I am an Agnostic. I am not a scholar, I am not an intellectual or a philosopher but I don't think I need to be one to be an Agnostic.

My question is not about philosophical arguments, logical exercises or anything of the like. It is about Atheist people, or more precisely about some of you.

I was raised a Catholic and was only through constant self questioning of my own beliefs that I became an Agnostic. I believe questioning my own beliefs and ideas is the thing that keeps me sane and true. I very seldom trust myself absolutely on any idea, this way I try to keep myself open to new arguments. I am willing to respect and listen to believers and not believers alike as long as they respect me. 

I have had very nurturing discussions with Atheists and Agnostics as well as religious people and ministers when they are willing to just talk freely and honestly.

But I feel very disappointed here. I am a man and I feel like crying. Most of the time I try to start what I believe is an open minded discussion with Atheists I feel like I am running against a wall of dogma. I have been mistaken for a troll by people who seem to think I am set to anger them when I am just trying to talk or question what I believe are hard coded arguments either for or against god. It seems to me that there is only one correct way to think about god in these parts and that my way of thinking is never welcome. 

I like to come here and bring in my own honest point of view and honestly I also seek validation -like I think most of us do-, some times I may sound pedantic, or seem disrespectful but I assure you I am not doing intentionally.

That is that miracles claimed in islam, in hinduism in sihkism in christianity (heck maybe the egyptian, norse greek and roman ones too) really happened.

To my mind this means Baha'i has got something going for it that other religions lack (but atheism and agnostisism have).

Namely a uniform standard of evidence for accepting or rejecting miraculous or prophetic testimony.

In payment for this it has even greater problems with internal consistency than other religions.

Well I have quite a unique perspective of Buddhism with some beliefs even stemming past the whole of Buddhism. Let's do it!

EDIT: Ok, here's a quick run down of what I believe:

* There is a God; everything is this God. No one can truly reach God with prayer or some type of contact and every soul is made from said God. It is all and all is it.

* I believe in something called the astral plane and spiritual evolution. When you pass, you are sent to the astral plane, a place where all past lives are known, all knowledge is available to you, and no one or thing has a physical form. Sensory details are much more varied, i.e. more colors than what we see here, ability to feel emotions never felt before, etc.  Here is where you will reincarnate after some time spent reflecting on your past lives or you will be able to move one and kind of ""graduate"" to a higher being depending on how well you have fulfilled your purpose here on the physical plane. I also believe in spirit guides.  They are entities who once were in our position, but have since progressed spiritually and are there to help guide you along your right path without actually telling you your path.

* I believe everyone and everything has love in them.  Give a person enough time, sometimes ridiculous amounts of time, and eventually they will right themselves and reach enlightenment.

* Obviously I believe in reincarnation and karma. No explanation of that really needed, I'd think.

**EDIT**: I've been told everyone. I apologize, but I really do have a shit argument. My ""evidence"" really can't be proven in any way. It is all strictly anecdotal and I apologize for wasting people's time. I didn't really think this through, but I had a good time. I appreciate everyone's reply, and thank you for taking the time to talk about all this, but you guys are too good and I can't really prove shit as you can see.

Essentially they say that (ignoring whether or not god exists); if atheism were the true then the inalienable “god given rights” are no longer inalienable. Strict constitutionalist Christians sometimes reference John Locke and the Declaration of independence to justify that our innate rights are really there because of God, whether that be a deistic god that many founders believed in or the Christian one. 

My immediate argument to this is that rights don’t necessarily exist and are just constructs agreed upon by a society (which is why rights documents throughout history have been variable). But the thought of this even scares a way some moderates and religious liberals because it means that our rights aren’t rooted in anything “substantial”. It’s an understandable fear, so I’d like construct a set of reasons to convince them otherwise.

The most famous example that many cite to back up this claim is the incident with Galileo, who was ostracized and condemned by the Catholic Church for his theories. This seems like a perfectly good example for an instance where religion has denounced science. 

However, many of these same anti-theists also believe that these religious institutions are corrupt. They scoff (so do I) when the Pope emerges from his balcony, grasping his golden sceptor and wearing opulent jewels, spewing BS like ""give to the poor"" and be ""humble"".  I agree with the idea that the Church is corrupt.

So, how can one say that religion is corrupted because the Catholic Church is? If the institution is corrupt, how can we say that it accurately represents what religion is about? It is very hypocritical indeed. Take for example, American democracy. With the current situation we have today, the political parties on both sides have used the system of democracy to deny the other party legislation. The President cannot do anything because some elected officials use our system of balances and checks to stop any legislation from going through, causing mass panic and hysteria as seen in the debt-ceiling crisis, where the GOP held the country hostage for their own beliefs.

According to common anti-theist logic, then that would mean it is democracy that must be abolished. We should remove democracy so that the officials will not take advantage of it, right? We should blame the system (democracy/religion) instead of blaming the corrupt citizens who abuse it (officials/priests), right? 

An even simpler argument comes down to this: if a man shoots a guy, do you blame the man or the gun? Just because the gun was the reason why the man died, it is not why the man died; it was the shooter's own crazy mindset.

tl;dr? Do not blame the system when it does not work. Blame those who abuse it.

These answers lead me to think that there is two meanings people apply to omnipotence.

The first is that omnipotence is not bound by any logic and truely limitless.  For example an omnipotent being can make a square with 6 sides.  A square by definition is an object with 4 sides but that doesn't stop such a being from creating one with 6 and it still being a square.  Now omnipotence is a word we use to communicate so if this is the accepted way you want to treat the word it does render any objection meaningless and really any discussion so.

Because omnipotence isn't bound by logic or reason you can problem with say the Bible can be handwaved away.  Can an omnipotent God who is all knowing and all good create a world completely full of unneccessary evil all without comprimising its all goodness?  Sure.  Can such a being make a rock that it can't lift without making something it can't do?  Sure.  Any and all problem can be handwaived away but it cuts both ways.  It does nothing to support any religions stance because omnipotence allows for the case to be the opposite while still providing all the reasons to believe something else.  So lets call this irrational omnipotence.

So if you want to use the other kind, the sort that makes sense to our minds, where an omnipotent being can't do things like make a square with only 1 side, it does limit the questions that can be asked.  The old making a huge rock question becomes a nonsense question to ask.  The question can be approached two ways with this sort of omnipotence.  ""Can God, who can lift any rock, lift this rock?""  Or ""Can God lift this rock that God can't lift?""  Or when you strip out the specifics completely.  ""Can God who can do this thing that God can't do, do this thing?""  Either the answer is allready in the question or it becomes nonsensical.

Going with the latter definition at least allows for some more debate though on both sides.

***Ex-Catholic here***. *While I cannot say I am masterfully well-versed with the entirety of Catholic doctrines, I can say that OP has a long way to go and probably shouldn't have bothered. Much of what he said is just plain wrong.*

The views are actually quite simple: Catholicism argues that homosexuality is unnatural. Anything natural by most Christian definitions is that which is a result of God's intentions (or in accordance with it). It is also argued within this belief that one must only marry someone if they are truly in love. Now, since homosexuality is unnatural, then as a result, it is impossible for two people of the same sex to fall in love (intimately). Love is God, and anything related to God is natural, so by default, love can only be achieved through natural means.

Onto the subject of sex now. First of all, Christianity defines sex as the physical expression of true (intimate) love for another. As a result of this, many things are out the window. For instance: gay sex (explained above), premarital sex and protected sex. Feel free to ask about the last two in the comments (I won't be expanding on them here). Having said all that, it is *not mandatory* to have sex with the person you love. Additionally, having children with the person you love is also *not mandatory*. While reproduction is encouraged in Christian faiths, it is not a requirement.

* Going allll the way back up to the top, what I was trying to agree with, is that for the most part, people seem to like to fight, as if it were something to win. Atheists believe that Christians are wrong, Christians believe that Atheists are wrong.

Yet, one side can be right, one can be wrong, or both can be wrong. The only possibility that can’t occur is that we’re both completely correct.  I’m not doing this to win some non-existent prize, I’m doing this because the science tells me there’s nothing in the sky. We know there’s no hell below us. But I’ll get into this stuff later maybe. I don’t want to come off as dismissive from the start. 

* Because of this, it usually ends up being either attacks, e.g. Look at these stupid Christians, how can they believe this, and vice versa, or challenges. I completely understand it, but I don't agree with it. It's never out of curiosity that one side talks to the other side, it's always out of either proving that the other side is wrong, proving that your side is right, etc. So... I really appreciate your civility sir. I absolutely do. You are a gentleman and a scholar.

Well thanks for the kind words. I’ll do my best to live up to them. It is kind of distressing to see people insisting things that aren’t there, are there. Imagine the Twilight Zone episode with William Shatner and the monster on the wing. He freaks out and insists there is a gremlin  on the wing ripping the plane apart. Now Imagine there’s not really a gremlin (because as we know they don’t exist), it really is just in his head. Now imagine the gremlin  “tells” him that he has to kill someone or he’ll crash the plain. Would you want to be sitting next to him? Would you want your children on that plane? 

It’s easy to compare stories we think of as alike. We can easily imagine Spock meeting Yoda. We can imagine Thor meeting Hercules. We can imagine Mario meeting Sonic. 

It would be VERY easy to think that someone who actually believed Sonic the Hedgehog was real, someone that wouldn’t accept evidence to the contrary, was well, “delusional” is the most appropriate word. That it is the most appropriate also makes it overused. I try to think and use words properly. Stupid is a word better to describe specific actions, not people as a whole. 

I believe I hold in my head, enough information to “prove you wrong”. (Or any Christian really.) The problem is I can’t do it without a little help. You have to first consider that it’s even possible that you could be wrong. Very few people are willing to do that, so things do tend to go in circles. At the very least, you’d have to admit you’re curious how people that are so massively informed about this stuff can be so certain that your God is a fictional being that never existed. How is it that I don’t even have a slight fear of hell? Ok moving on. 

 * To get down to your actual post now... (Thanks for clearing that up, even though I read it after the edit, it would have seemed that way a bit. No hard feelings on either side I hope.)

I was never intending to dismiss you, I just wanted to wait and talk after you saw the movie. Then I realized it put unnecessary conditions on things, so I went ahead and answered. 

* I also never said that He was my god. I am basically a freak of nature. Half Christian / Half Atheist. I have been heavily on either side of the ""fence."" Was raised a Christian, so I understand and know a lot about it, and have been an atheist for several years. Now I am back on the fence. I am on neither side and both sides at the same time.

Well that makes a bit of sense. I can’t say I’ll be impartial, I’m going to do my damnedest to sway you and anyone else that may be lucky enough to read this over to the hellbound side. 

* It's a really interesting vantage point and I enjoy it. I really wish that I could shit or get off the pot, but I can't! I absolutely love that you put that on hold. Another reason that it seems like most things end up into attacks is that atheists almost never want to see it from the other point of view, it's always that they're right and trying to convince the other that they're wrong.

If you stand on the fence too long your feet will begin to hurt and your legs will cramp. Sitting on the pot too long could give you a nasty case of hemorrhoids. (a clever response that really doesn’t translate to anything meaningful when converted back to your analogy. That’s the problem with analogies, clever responses can be completely nonsensical bullshit.) 

* So again, I really appreciate it. I shouldn't have said choose to love. You put worshipping and loving together so I was trying to keep them. I shouldn't have. I understand your analogy, but I don't think that it paints an accurate picture of who God is. As far as I understand, the Christian God desires for people to love him.

And he punishes them if they don’t. 

* He's not an evil king that will throw someone down a dungeon,

Right, hell is a lot worse than a mere dungeon. And “Tyrant” may be more appropriate than “king”

* and he doesn't hate fags. No, I don't think that she should choose to love him. I think that she could probably force herself to love him, but it probably wouldn't be healthy.

I still argue that it isn’t even possible. If classic literature tells us anything, the most she could do is make herself numb and go through the motions. (and I'll get to ""the gay thing"" in due time)

* I'm sure you could brainwash yourself if you tried hard enough. [assume that god is real] He's not going to hurl a fireball down on someone for cursing him.

We’re talking about a God that turned a woman to salt for looking back at the people he was throwing fireballs at. He’ll do worse to you for less. 

* I think it's really interesting that atheists always take on the view that God is so evil, and Christians say that God is so good.

Um, atheists say we don't think there is a god. We also don’t look at the character of Yahweh through rose colored glasses. We don’t defend and explain away and justify his every action. We can just look at the events and evaluate them just like anything else. 

* To debate good and evil would take a while, but it seems that you are focussing on only bad attributes from a certain vantage point. I'm going to try to argue each of your attributes, and while it might sound completely stupid, I hope that they don't. I can't think of what you mean by ill tempered, give me an example please. If you're talking about Old Testament references of him killing people and children, I hate to sound inhumane, but he can. I was listening to a debate where one side argued that it wasn't morally right to, if you created a sentient creature, or robot, shut it down or kill it. You weren't justified. I think being it's creator you seem the only person who would be justified to kill it.

Have to disagree. Once the robot is sentient, NO ONE has a right to kill it. It’s not a fair analogy though because God is said to be perfect and all knowing. Humans aren’t either of those things. So let’s say a human somehow avoided careless mistakes when building this robot. No miscalculations, everything is measured properly, the robot is essentially flawless. Now before the creator builds the robot, he knows the robot is going to ""need to be killed"" (in HIS opinion), and when it will ""need to be killed"", it will not want to die. The question then isn’t “should it be killed?” they are “should it be created?” and “isn’t his eventual ""need to be killed"" the creators fault?” 

Isn’t it cruel to create a life form knowing you’re going to kill it? And let’s not pull punches here. I’m only borrowing TWO of  God’s divine attributes. The ability to create a flawless being, and the knowledge of the future. God has the ability to create WITHOUT RESOURCES. He didn’t consume anything when he made the universe did he? And he was limited only by his imagination, right? He also didn’t have a time table, no rush. He could also read the minds of the beings before he created them right? So he knew the pain and anguish the robot would feel as HE was killing it, before he wrote up the plans. God could have created a robot that would have lived a happy life. Instead he chose to build one that he would get to kill. Let’s not use “have to” when it comes to God though. He makes it very clear he doesn’t HAVE to do anything.

I was reading the chapter on The Authority and Inerrancy of the Bible and I came across a small paragraph that I thought was an interesting argument.

I wanted to think what you think about it if you have or haven't heard this particular argument before:

&gt; ***#4. The words of Scripture are self-attesting.*** Since the words of Scripture are ""self-attesting,"" they cannot be ""proved"" to be God's words by appeal to any higher authority. If we make our ultimate appeal, for example, to human logic or to scientific truth to prove that the Bible is God's Word, then we assume the thing to which we appeal to be a higher authority than God's words and one that is more true or more reliable. Therefore, the ultimate authority by which Scripture is shown to be God's words must be Scripture itself.

This is all on page 37 if you happen to have the book. Additionally, in the next paragraphs he speaks of circular reasoning and notes that: 

&gt;It should be admitted that this is a kind of circular argument. However that does not make its use invalid, for all arguments for an absolute authority must ultimately appeal to that authority for proof; otherwise the authority would not be an absolute or highest authority.

I believe that when I was six years old, I was me, and now, many years later, I am still me. Now, obviously I physically exist, because otherwise something very funny is happening to my keyboard. But that’s not what I’m talking about. I mean that there is a quality of ghjm-ness which is shared between six-year-old me and however-old-I-am-now me. Let’s call this property X.

I do not insist that X should be a supernatural or spiritual property. I don’t know anything about X other than the above. So what is the nature of X?

X cannot arise from my particular composition atoms and molecules, because all or very nearly all of my atoms and molecules have changed since I was six. X cannot arise from my memories, attitudes, moods or ideas, because I remember very few of the things that occupied me when I was six, and my moods, attitudes and ideas have changed quite drastically since then.

X cannot arise from the chemistry or ion channel interactions in my brain, because those are in a constant, moment-by-moment state of change. Nor can X arise from an arrangement of neural pathways, even if they are relatively long-lived, because X would still hold – I would still be me – even if I suffered some horrible brain injury that disrupted these pathways, and even if such an injury radically changed my moods, attitudes or capabilities.

But perhaps X is an emergent property of some non-obvious physical attribute. Maybe I am “me” due to some informational content of the “software” of the brain that will in the future be explained by science in strictly materialistic terms. So, in the great tradition of scientists who don’t have any data yet, let’s do a thought experiment. Suppose we had a matter duplicator. Through some future physics, this duplicator is able to reproduce, precisely, a designated object of matter, all the way down to its quantum states. With this matter duplicator, I can create a living copy of myself.

As the operator of the duplicator, I can be quite certain that I am still me. The new copy, walking out of the duplicator, is not. Because he shares my memories, attitudes and beliefs up to the point of duplication, he, like me, will insist on his own enduring existence – but he will insist on Y, which he will agree is different from X. Even though no memories, neuronal pathways, brain chemistry or “soft” states have been destroyed, or, at the moment of duplication, changed, he is simply *not* me. If at the conclusion of the experiment, I decide to clean up my lab and set about destroying the “temporary” copy, I am sure he would strenuously object. He would see Y as being just as valuable as I see X. What is he protecting? The value he ascribes to Y cannot arise from his two minutes of unique existence in the lab. Both of us would agree to lose those memories for a million dollars, but we would not agree to be *killed* for a million dollars. So there is some essential value of Y other than its slight difference from X.

From this, it appears to me that insisting on my own existence is incompatible with strict materialism, even if you deny (as I do) the existence of God or (in the Christian sense) souls.

I am just presenting it. Secondly, these are arguments for *generic* theism, not the theism of any particular religion, and in fact you would be perfectly justified in disputing that the word ""God"" can even be applied to what they argue for. 

**Premise #1**:* Every truth has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause.*

This comes from the [principle of sufficient reason](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sufficient-reason/), and is difficult to argue *for* as it can be seen as a presupposition of basic reasoning. It can be disputed, but it would be difficult to really dispute with any clarity and it would be a burden to say what's wrong with it exactly. It could be seen as a properly basic axiom.

Examples of truths that have an external cause: chairs, rocks, people, galaxies

Examples of truths that exist by necessity: numbers, mathematical propositions, logic.

**Premise #2**: *If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God.*

It may seem like a bare assertion at first, but it's the logical [contraposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraposition) of a common atheist proposition. Bertrand Russell said, ""I should say that the universe is just there, and that is all."" The universe has no explanation of its existence; it just exists, it's just a brute fact, period. 

I.e., if theism is false, then the universe has no explanation of its existence. ""If not Q, then not P."" 

Which can be contraposed (and is thus logically equivalent) to ""If P, then Q"": if the universe has an explanation of its existence, then theism is true.

**Premise #3**: *The universe exists.*

Self explanatory unless you are a solipsist.

**Conclusion**: *Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God.*

The argument is logically valid, so to deny the conclusion you must deny one of the premises.

While I understand that the individual interior experience varies widely from person to person and is also subject to interpretation, bias, delusion, mental illness and other forms of ""error"", it should not be disregarded. For even though our brains process the chemical and electromagnetic signals to produce our interior experience, that experience of what the truth is ultimately creates the worldview we live through.

Have you heard of the neurosurgeon Eben Alexander that wrote a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Proof-Heaven-Neurosurgeons-Journey-Afterlife/dp/1451695195) on his near death experience while his brain wave activity was being monitored? If there are states of consciousness when there is no brain activity going on, then brain wave activity is not a necessary condition of consciousness.



Have you seen the studies by [Benjamin Libet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet)?

Libet discovered that prior to a person’s awareness of his decision to press the button, a brain signal had already occurred which resulted in his finger’s later moving. So the sequence is: (1) a brain signal occurs about 550 milliseconds prior to the finger’s moving; (2) the subject has an awareness of his decision to move his finger about 200 milliseconds prior to his finger’s moving; (3) the person’s finger moves. On a second run of the experiments, Libet discovered that even after the brain signal fired and people were aware of their decision to push the button, people still retained the ability to veto the decision and refrain from pushing the button! This is precisely what a dualist interactionist would expect to see.

Professor : You are a Christian, aren’t you, son ?

Student : Yes, sir.

Professor: So, you believe in GOD ?

Student : Absolutely, sir.

Professor : Is GOD good ?

Student : Sure.

Professor: Is GOD all powerful ?

Student : Yes.

Professor: My brother died of cancer even though he prayed to GOD to heal him. Most of us would attempt to help others who are ill. But GOD didn’t. How is this GOD good then? Hmm?

(Student was silent.)

Professor: You can’t answer, can you ? Let’s start again, young fella. Is GOD good?

Student : Yes.

Professor: Is satan good ?

Student : No.

Professor: Where does satan come from ?

Student : From … GOD …

Professor: That’s right. Tell me son, is there evil in this world?

Student : Yes.

Professor: Evil is everywhere, isn’t it ? And GOD did make everything. Correct?

Student : Yes.

Professor: So who created evil ?

(Student did not answer.)

Professor: Is there sickness? Immorality? Hatred? Ugliness? All these terrible things exist in the world, don’t they?

Student : Yes, sir.

Professor: So, who created them ?

(Student had no answer.)

Professor: Science says you have 5 Senses you use to identify and observe the world around you. Tell me, son, have you ever seen GOD?

Student : No, sir.

Professor: Tell us if you have ever heard your GOD?

Student : No , sir.

Professor: Have you ever felt your GOD, tasted your GOD, smelt your GOD? Have you ever had any sensory perception of GOD for that matter?

Student : No, sir. I’m afraid I haven’t.

Professor: Yet you still believe in Him?

Student : Yes.

Professor : According to Empirical, Testable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says your GOD doesn’t exist. What do you say to that, son?

Student : Nothing. I only have my faith.

Professor: Yes, faith. And that is the problem Science has.

Student : Professor, is there such a thing as heat?

Professor: Yes.

Student : And is there such a thing as cold?

Professor: Yes.

Student : No, sir. There isn’t.

(The lecture theater became very quiet with this turn of events.)

Student : Sir, you can have lots of heat, even more heat, superheat, mega heat, white heat, a little heat or no heat. But we don’t have anything called cold. We can hit 458 degrees below zero which is no heat, but we can’t go any further after that. There is no such thing as cold. Cold is only a word we use to describe the absence of heat. We cannot measure cold. Heat is energy. Cold is not the opposite of heat, sir, just the absence of it.

(There was pin-drop silence in the lecture theater.)

Student : What about darkness, Professor? Is there such a thing as darkness?

Professor: Yes. What is night if there isn’t darkness?

Student : You’re wrong again, sir. Darkness is the absence of something. You can have low light, normal light, bright light, flashing light. But if you have no light constantly, you have nothing and its called darkness, isn’t it? In reality, darkness isn’t. If it is, well you would be able to make darkness darker, wouldn’t you?

Professor: So what is the point you are making, young man ?

Student : Sir, my point is your philosophical premise is flawed.

Professor: Flawed ? Can you explain how?

Student : Sir, you are working on the premise of duality. You argue there is life and then there is death, a good GOD and a bad GOD. You are viewing the concept of GOD as something finite, something we can measure. Sir, Science can’t even explain a thought. It uses electricity and magnetism, but has never seen, much less fully understood either one. To view death as the opposite of life is to be ignorant of the fact that death cannot exist as a substantive thing.

Death is not the opposite of life: just the absence of it. Now tell me, Professor, do you teach your students that they evolved from a monkey?

Professor: If you are referring to the natural evolutionary process, yes, of course, I do.

Student : Have you ever observed evolution with your own eyes, sir?

(The Professor shook his head with a smile, beginning to realize where the argument was going.)

Student : Since no one has ever observed the process of evolution at work and cannot even prove that this process is an on-going endeavor. Are you not teaching your opinion, sir? Are you not a scientist but a preacher?

(The class was in uproar.)

Student : Is there anyone in the class who has ever seen the Professor’s brain?

(The class broke out into laughter. )

Student : Is there anyone here who has ever heard the Professor’s brain, felt it, touched or smelt it? No one appears to have done so. So, according to the established Rules of Empirical, Stable, Demonstrable Protocol, Science says that you have no brain, sir. With all due respect, sir, how do we then trust your lectures, sir?

(The room was silent. The Professor stared at the student, his face unfathomable.)

For those who don't want to google (and I may be using that term wrong anyway) deterministic universe basically means that because the laws of science behave in a particular, predictable way, and the reactions between chemicals can be predicted, that from the moment of the big bang, the entire fate of everything in the universe was decided because things only react in one way.

Since we ourselves are little more than incredibly complex self sustaining chemical reactions, would our actions be just as predictable as combusting a hydrocarbon?

He asks ' How do you know your living in the correct reality (how do you know what is real)? You believe in logic then? How do you make sense of the laws of logic according to your worldview (law of non contradiction for example)?'

He says he has plenty of evidence for God, but 'does not present evidence for people who don't account for the very concept of evidence.'. What a jerk! 

But what? Do I need to 'account for'/'make sense of' the concept of evidence? 

Then he goes on:

'We all have the same evidence. We just understand it differently. However when you use evidence your using knowledge. How can you have knowledge apart from God? In other words whats one thing you know and how do you know it for certain? In my worldview in order to know anything at all you either have to have all knowledge (otherwise something could contradict what you think you know) or you have to have revelation from somebody who does know everything. In my position that would be God, who has revealed specific things to us such that we can know them for certain, such as that He exists for an example.'

'How do I know its not imaginary? Revelation from God. You have the same revelation I have. Just the difference is that I'm proclaiming it and your suppressing it. All knowledge and certainty comes from the God of the Bible alone (Proverbs 1:7).'

So I know something that I don't know about?

**'If the laws of logic are man man that means different cultures could adapt different laws of logic and they are not absolute, making my position not fallacious anymore, and any illogical argument can then become logical 5 minutes from now.'
**

Errrr...? 

He says evidence presupposes truth. And knowledge by definition is justified true belief and without absolute certainty you have no full expectation that the sun will come up or that the universe will remain uniform. The Christian will state ""We fully know that the sun will come up and that the universe will remain uniform and we can't be wrong about that."" Its not just as Christians but all people including yourself know specific things for absolute certainty, such as that God exists (Romans 1:18-21).

He admits 'I honestly do not know how God reveals, but all because I don't know how God make a cow that doesn't mean God didn't make a cow.'  

?!?!?!

Also his friend chimed in and said 'In a universe of chance there would be no love, no right or wrong, no justice.' Uhhh, what?

Fellow atheist here, this is more of a question than anything else.  This seems to be the best place to ask.  

I'm somewhat embarrassed to admit that I only just learned about the Catholic belief that Jesus himself founded the Catholic church (I'm 29, atheist for over a decade, typical Christian exposure is Anglicanism/Evangelical).  I've been skimming through some wikipedia information and doing google searches to get as much details as possible.

For example, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Catholic_Church

The reason this is interesting to me is because it exploited a hole in my fairly extensive arsenal for debating with theists.  One of my go-to methods is to show the unreliability of the bible as a source.  I thought that without the bible, Christianity was crutchless.  The bible was their only way to know and describe their God.  Apparently I'd never debated a Catholic before, because this didn't work this time.

The gist of the response I got was ""the Catholic church was there before the bible (as we know it today) - the bible is *of* the church, etc."", so removing the credibility of the bible actually isn't really an issue for a Catholic, because the bible is secondary to the history of the church.

For some reason that has left me a little tongue tied.  

In my research so far, I haven't really found any responses to the claim that ""Jesus started the Catholic Church"".  

I know there are some obvious things surrounding the issue of Jesus' divinity (because it seems the consensus is this ""Jesus"" character of the bible was a real person, just not divine).  Did this non-divine, crazy Jesus character actually start the Catholic church?  

Really, any and all information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  I soak this shit up like a sponge.  

Basically the goal of this thread is, if someone comes to me and says ""Yeah, it's not a big deal that the bible isn't a reliable source.  It doesn't really matter because the Catholic church was there right from the beginning.  Heck, *we* were the ones that compiled the damn thing.  So I still know (without relying on the bible) that there is a God, and that God is the Christian God.""

More questions
----
I know that I don't want to die (shocker), and thinking about 'nothing' after death is something that freaks me out. I was raised as a Catholic, but I am no longer. Even still, it was a tough switch in thought from a cushy afterlife to the idea of the unknown. Beyond childhood indoctrination though, it is my understanding that most early people began to be spiritual or religious at one point or another, do you think that this shift is the result of a gradual increase in self-awareness, and does that support the idea that spirituality is rational?


I feel that with few exceptions, people are generally scared shitless of dying. Doesn't it make sense for people to believe in an extension of their consciousness to alleviate that fear?

Finally, if I have made any sense up to this point, what are the implications of religion? Is there a point where group spirituality is a bad thing? What is that point? Conversely, is there a limit where it is OK?

Any possible rebuttals or theists who have an answer please send it my way. 

 The objection I often raise to theists who I like to debate with normal follows some one using Pascals wager as a defense but it is more directly a problem with the concept of hell.  If a person truly believes that people will go to hell as most fundamentalists I argue with do, how can they justify not spending every waking moment as a missionary trying to convert people and save them from ETERNAL AGONY?  Most people would try to help a person burning alive in front of them, and hell will be immolation for all time. Going to work or taking a vacation, marrying, it all seems so trivial and selfish to focus on instead of saving people from that pain and suffering. 

A defense I've heard for proselytizing is along the lines of if you see a truck coming toward an oblivious person you try to save them. Only this is not just one person it's hundreds of thousands of people all laying down on a road unaware of a coming truck. Stopping to chat up a pretty girl instead of yelling about the truck would seem morally reprehensible. Stopping to work and get that raise, going to your fathers funeral, or even stopping to eat or sleep more than is absolutely unnecessary seems selfish and morally wrong. and remember this road has children and newborns laying on it as well mothers fathers, men and women of all ages.

How can any person who believes in a hell justify their inaction and apparent selfishness and cruelty?

The God in question is a personal being, who created the universe that we live in. He does not have the traditional attributes of omnipotence, omniscience, etc. He does not know the future and has not predetermined anything. There is no afterlife, no heaven or hell. Self-aware, conscious beings are one of his favourite things, but he refuses to intervene (both to stop evil and to do miracles.). He has watched life evolve on millions of planets across our universe. He does not demand worship and has not sought to make himself known to any of his creations.

Could such a being exist? What counter arguments would you guys have? (Thanks.)

If you don't want the back story you can skip down to after the divider for the question. 

I'm the lone atheist in my circle of friends. It's mostly normal Christians and a few fundies. We frequently get into theological debates on a variety of topics. Evolution gets brought up a lot, but there's a wealth of information supporting it and most of the normal Christians in my group believe in it already. However, one frequent argument that comes up is that even if Christianity isn't true that people are better off believing in God because without religious doctrines to guide you, you are less moral.

My counter-argument to this is that they don't have any real proof of that beyond anecdotal cherry picked evidence. They typically go to the Mao-Stalin-Pulpot argument which I refute with them being not causative with atheism. I'll typically then ask them what moral teaching does religion impart that you can't arrive at rationally as an atheist. They say charity/altruism. I then explain the evolutionary basis of altruism. They then say Christians are more altruistic and more moral in general. From here the argument devolves into a series of subjective assertions and, being outnumbered, I always find myself on the defensive.
****
**What I want to know is...** Are there any empirical studies out there about atheism and morality? Any studies or figures which show atheists to be less/more philanthropic, criminal, violent, adulterous, exploitative, or any other quality associated with morality. I'd prefer studies which are more empirically based (e.g. criminality statistics) and control for external factors if possible. I'd also prefer studies that deal with the US population (although I welcome all studies) because it would carry more weight amongst my group of friends. I don't want any anecdotal stuff and would prefer studies that aren't overly survey based. I don't care if the numbers are against my preconceived notions just as long as they're objective; I'd just like to know the cold hard facts.

Instead of 'preaching' your beliefs and explaining why the theist is wrong, why not ask them what they believe, show true interest, and just have them explain it to you...

This actually kind of falls into the lines of ""why do bad things happen to good people"" and vice versa. If one thing is made very clear in the Christian Bible, it's that God is NOT here to pave roads for us. God may choose to strengthen us in many different ways in our times of need, but it's not always how things work out.

The best way I can describe this, is thinking of God as a caring parent, and mankind as a reckless youth. For example, if I, as the parent tell my son, I don't want you to go doing dangerous skateboarding stunts at the park. All i can do is tell him that, provide as many pads, a helmet, etc, as I possibly can, but ultimately its up to him to follow my advice, or to use the protection I've given him.

I do think that there is a god. I was an atheist for a little but I just came to the assumption that with all that is around us and just the universe itself is all too complex and grand for it to be not created by some sort of God.  Just statistically speaking its very hard for me to believe that the creation of Earth to you reading this reddit itself was a series of fortunate events.  
I'll also assume there aren't many people like me. 

I mean if you were to step back and look at the new testament for what it is.  Whether you assume to be non fiction or fiction, wouldn't you want to be associated with a person who spread a morally good message.

EDIT: Awesome responses love reading what you guys have to say. I'm getting shit on by you guys but its awesome because I'm learning stuff. 

Correct me If I'm wrong the premise of hatred for Christianity with the majority of you guys, is with what the Roman Catholic Church has done and is still doing i.e. oppressing science, thought, and other ideas.  Second most of you have a problem with the believers which I can see.  Many Christians do have a narrow view of the universe that Earth is ""it"" and there is nothing else.  I'll also agree the religion in politics, in America anyway, is really setting us back.  The founding fathers would be cursing out the leaders of today because of the infusion of religion into our government. 
 As for my premise of God, I guess it is underdeveloped idea at this point.  People will argue that humans take the premise of a god as an anchor of sort to give their life a meaning.  That is not why I believe in a god.  Frankly its sad when people use God as a promise of a better life in the next one.  Meanwhile they waste the potential of what they could have been in this life.  
Yes its easier to say magic then to actually go out and attempt to discover the 'why'.  I want humanity to discover the Why.   I feel that many people in religious circles are so afraid that Science will prove them wrong instead of an opportunity for Science to prove them right.

The theory as I understand it, suggests that the story about Jesus was originally meant to be that once he died, he lived on in a sort of spiritual sense, and in order to portray that sentiment, the story of the empty tomb and later the appearances were embellished for story-telling purposes.

A potential problem with that theory:

There were many messianic movements during that time period, but once the supposed messiah died, so did the message, as this showed it was not the real messiah. What was so special with Jesus that they developed this new idea that this was the messiah who was risen after three days unless they actually saw him afterward? This type of belief in a spiritual messiah, with a spiritual kingdom, who would be raised from the dead was unheard of among the Jews. 

I would argue that new ideas occur all the time and that it is not that unbelievable that a belief like this could occur without an actual appearance, but I wonder if anyone has any historically based argument for this? Wouldn't the simplest explanation be that he was seen, which prompted the belief?

Most of these are understandable as ~~some~~ a lot of theists can be very obnoxious about this. However, from a theist's perspective, don't they have a moral obligation to try to convert you? A theist believes that if you don't convert to their faith, you will rot in hell in the afterlife for eternity.

This was argued to me a while ago, and the person arguing it used an analogy with a truck. If you saw someone standing in the middle of the street, and saw that a truck was about to hit them, and you had the power to prevent it, wouldn't you have an obligation to help that person, either by moving them out of the way or by warning them? Since this is a hypothetical, let's ignore whether or not the truck actually hits the person. What matters here is the *perception* that someone is about to be hurt or killed. 

Atheists: Even though you don't believe in an afterlife, and you believe that theism is wrong, would a theist have the duty to try to convert you? And if it's someone close, would it be understandable that they would try even after being rejected? 

And for the theists who lurk here: If you don't proselytize, why not? Do you not care, or is there another reason? Shouldn't you try to convert people even if they reject your attempts? And finally, is a failure to proselytize a sign of a failure of faith?

To both, I guess: Is the current negative social attitude towards evangelism a reasonable one, given the above?

While it's simple enough to claim that a theist apologist is committing a god of the gaps fallacy by suggesting that a supernatural creator was the so-called ""first cause"", more effective is closing that gap by explaining in layman's terms how the universe began. 

Last week, there was a lovely show called Curiosity on the Discovery Channel in which Stephen Hawking explained, in very basic terms, the origin of the universe. He explained that matter was a type of energy, and that there was an equal, and thus net-zero, amount of energy and negative energy in the universe. He then went on to explain that the big bang itself was not only the origin of matter/energy, but also time, meaning that the intuitive human understanding of cause and effect could not be applied. He described asking what caused the big bang as being similar to asking for directions to the edge of our spherical planet, that the question doesn't make sense given what we know. Still, in arguing with apologists, closing the gap by explaining the origin of the universe can be very tricky because the origin, based on our very best understanding, isn't particularly intuitive. It takes illustration and simplification to adequately explain. Heck, I barely understand it myself.

It must be accepted that the Christian will still raise their child with Christian moral standards, take them along to church with me, and read to them from the Bible.

First off, I am not expecting a child now, or anytime in the next few years. No reason to congratulate me lol... This is a hypothetical.

Second, this is intended to be more of a discussion rather than a debate. I would like ideas, and I am open-minded to hearing your advice, as long as you accept that I still have the reservations listed above, and will not deviate from those.

Third, I mainly ask for ideas based on experience. I know many in r/Atheism were raised by Christians, and you can say anything you liked or hated about how you were raised and how you would do something differently. For instance, one thing I would change about how I was raised would be to not send the child to a ""Christian"" school, and to explain other religions and atheism to them so they can get a broader picture.

Fourth, I want my future child to be raised with an open mind, so they can decide by themselves. I will go to a church that supports this view, and I will go to a church that will not press my child to make decisions before they can rationalize. Although I would greatly desire my child to choose Christianity, I want them to choose on their own. It would break my heart to see them choose something else, but I want them to have an equal chance at choosing other things, so they can effectively choose for their self. I believe with an open-minded worldview, a purer look at the Bible, and a good Christian community, the child will still choose Christianity, but I want to leave the option open for other things so they have the opportunity to choose. Also, this isn't a ""how-to-potty-train-your-child"", I hope you all can gather, so let's keep it on the philosophical side of parenting ;)

I don't do much philosophy stuff. He's not being very convincing to me personally but he thinks he's figured out proof that God HAS to exist. (Now as to how he gets the Christian God from that I've yet to hear...)

Here are his beliefs as I understand them so far. The universe has to be either finite or infinite. It can't be infinite because that would create an infinite regression of causation, which is a fallacy and therefore impossible, which leaves us with a finite universe that needs a cause. 

For that cause he names the solution God and says that there are certain things that God would have to be in order to be that answer. Let me copy/paste some of the stuff he has said. 

Now the question of God and how you determine if it is reasonable to accept the God might depend on how you define God. I went through a mental exercise a few months ago:

Q. What is God?

Q. Is God something?

Q. What is something?

A. Something is some thing.

Q. What is a thing?

A. A thing is that which has definition.

Q. What is definition?

A. Definition is 'de' meaning of or from &amp; 'finition' for finite, extent of, or limit of. Therefore definition is the identification of something's extent or limit.

A. Therefore, since an infinite God would not have definition, he is not a thing.

A. God is not something. Which is not to say that God does not exist but rather that God is that which exists that is not a thing. As the Bible says, ""I am that I am.""

So what can be said that is true of that which exists that is not a thing? You can know:

God does not have parts or otherwise one part would lack what another has.

God does not change, otherwise he would lack in time what he possessed in another time.

God has only one thought that encompasses all. For if he had many thoughts, each though would lack something in one thought that is present in another thought.

God is eternal. For if God were not, he would have a beginning and thus would have generation, lacking in one moment what he possessed in another and having a cause that is greater than he.

He linked to [this page](http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1002.htm) and especially noted Article 3.

He also says God is nothing and that 

There are two types of nothing: t

That which does not exist, therefore it has no extent.

That which exists, therefore it's extent is without limit.

He also says that claims which are self evident don't need to be proved because the claims are the proof, and that I might be having trouble seeing his claims as self evident due to corrupted first principles. 

I'm still waiting for responses on many of the things he has said since he seems to ""miss"" lots of the questions I've asked him. I'm expecting his latest reply to come in a bit later tonight.

I generally come here for stimulating debate, but also because I am fascinated by the psychology behind spiritual belief.

I've noticed that anthropocentrism is hard to shake, given not only the unrivaled domination of the human species, but simply because existence is only relevant to each of us through the filter of our own senses. Basically to ourselves, all objective existence is irrelevant if not through our own perspective. The subconscious tendency towards anthropocentrism is understandable.

What really struck me too was when I often noticed the argument that ""This book is evidence of a designer, as it is clearly assembled with purpose. The same is true for humans, being much more complex than just a book."" This is argument from analogy, but I wondered if there was a way to more specifically address what type.
What the above hypothetical debater (based on real examples of course) is not understanding is that the amount of time needed to be relevant for changes in the universe/nature is such due to the elemental interactions that that amount of time allows. With timescales observable/imaginable by humans, those elements do not have the time to produce as complex of results.

To assume nothing more is possible within a timeframe in the high thousands to billions of years than is possible within an imaginable (calculability aside), more human-relevant timeframe, is what I feel may be helpful to call the ""Scale Model Fallacy"".

Psychologically, it is when anthropocentrism (the assessment of reality through an exclusively human perspective) informs ""argument from analogy"" (noting the shared properties of two or more things, and from this basis inferring that they also share some further property).

1. A horribly simplified version of Buddhist metaphysics: the self is a process, as opposed to something eternal and soul-like. This process, after death, is freed of all attachments to the world, memories, and so on. The process then is reincarnated in another body.

2. The simulation argument:
&gt;This paper argues that at least one of the following propositions is true: (1) the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a “posthuman” stage; 
(2) any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history (or variations thereof); 
(3) we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.

3. Assuming that the universe is a simulation, computers within that simulation are most likely simulated as some sort of virtual machine, instead of by brute-force simulating every electron in a semiconductor chip.

4. Brains are computers, albeit heavily parallelized ones. They would likely also be simulated at a higher level than electrons and atoms.

5. If consciousness is simulated as a process, with some associated data structure holding habits, memory, etc, it is likely that these processes and their associated data structures will be reused to save resources.

6. Therefore, it is likely that in a simulated universe consciousness would be modeled as a process. These processes would likely be reused after death after wiping all associated data structures.

For background, I'm a pretty unconventional Christian/Theist.

I'm learned in science and am not an evangelist or literalist in any sense. 

Anyways, onto the topic. To me, one of the most startling recent scientific discoveries of our universe is anthropic fine-tuning. I assume that if you're responding, you're familiar with the concept. But if not, I'll give a quick summary with links and my knowledge of it: 

Basically, the fundamental constants of our universe are so remarkably fine-tuned for carbon-based life in so many different aspects, that if any differ slightly, life would no be possible anywhere. 

Now, such an occurrence calls for an explanation, and to quote from the following website, there truly only three plausible explanations of fine-tuning: ""Informed scientists now universally recognise that the Universe is exquisitely finely tuned to allow the coming into being of intelligent life. The only reasonable debate is whether this is due to:

a. A Loving Ultimate Creator
b. An extraordinary coincidence
c. The fact that there exists an infinity (or near-infinity) of other 'Universes' in which the constants are different, in an overall 'Multiverse'.

(c) is preferred by eg Martin Rees in his book Just Six Numbers, but only because he ""finds [a] incredible"" - he offers no arguments against it. Interestingly, just as (a) provides a modern form of the 'argument from design' (c) leads to a modern form of the 'ontological argument'. The most interesting of the advocates of (c) - Max Tegmark (formerly at the IAS, now at UPenn), proposes that any logically possible universe exists in the Multiverse. Since the existence of God is not logically impossible, it follows that God must exist in at least one Universe, but if God exists at all God must exist in all Universes (otherwise God would not be an ultimate creator).""

Now, pretty much no competent scientist ignores this claim. Victor Stenger, who I find to be a complete quack, claims that our universe isn't fine-tuned. You can see such arguments thoroughly dismantled by Luke Barnes here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4647 

I would like to sum up my thoughts on fine-tuning through this quote by John Polkinghorne, “no competent scientist denies that if the laws of nature were just little bit different in our universe, carbon-based life would never have been possible. Surely such a remarkable fact calls for an explanation. If one declines the insight of the universe as a creation endowed with potency, the rather desperate expedient of invoking an immense array of unobservable worlds seems the only other recourse.”

So atheists, especially those who acknowledge that our universe is fine-tuned, why do you believe that it is not by design? And what is your evidence? 

And for those of you who a la Stenger don't believe in anthropic fine-tuning, how do you warrant this? Honestly, given the evidence, I believe such a position is akin to creationism.

This post is a COUNTER-argument to the modal ontological argument, hence the subject.**

Not long ago I posted in /r/DebateReligion with my take on the modal ontological argument, and got mixed responses.

I've thought about it for a while since then, and haven't changed my mind on it much, and wanted to see what subscribers of /r/DebateAnAtheist thought.

Last time I rambled on quite a lot. I was going to try to shorten it but realised I can't without leaving out key points.

First off, the argument defines two things:

1. Maximal excellence is being omnipotent, omniscient and omnibenevolent in some possible world.
2. Maximal greatness is having maximal excellence in all possible worlds.

Ignoring the contradictions of the Three-O's, then so good so far. Next, you're told **one** of the possible worlds is the actual world. Also no problem.

Now, I've never heard it said that more than 1 possible world could be an actual world, and so I take it to mean that a possible world includes everything, and is a complete set of reality. In fact, that's how I've heard it described, also often as a ""maximal state of affairs"", of which the actual world is one.

You're asked to then accept ""A maximally great being is possible"". OK, so we know that maximal greatness is being maximally excellent in all possible worlds. If we agree with this, then God exists in the actual world.

The issue is you're asked to accept that it's possible in some world, but not in those exact words. It says ""If a maximally great being is possible, then it is possible in some world"". Well, no. Maximal greatness is either maximal excellence in all, or none.

I won't be caught out by this trickery. Maximal greatness is defined clearly already. There's no existing in just 1 world. That would be maximal excellence.

So, if it turns out God is real, and we actually find God and prove his existence, then is he going to be maximally excellent, or maximally great? Well, only 1 of these possible worlds is the actual world, and so God would only be existing in 1 world, and so he'd be maximally excellent.

The argument (Edit: Craig's version) concludes with ""A maximally great being exists in the actual world"" which could only be the case if all possible worlds were actual worlds. So, if interpreting it literally, then I'd say the argument is actually invalid, and not just unsound.

What then, is maximal greatness? Maximal greatness is to conceive of separate individual conceptions of God, in separate individual conceptions of possible worlds. God can't from World 1, talk to the people of World 2, unless World 1 and World 2 exist at the same time. If they can exist at the same time, then what stops there being more than 1 actual world?

Am I supposed to accept that all possible worlds have to contain God? Can't possible worlds not have God in it? It doesn't matter if these worlds can contain God or not, just so long as God isn't existing in one of them, in which case a maximally great being doesn't exist. God can't put himself in a world that he's not in, unless these possible worlds are existing at the same time.

What then is a possible world, if it's not everything and a totality of reality? If a possible world isn't everything, then you're being asked to imagine a multiverse, and if a God that exists in all universes exists in 1 universe, then it exists in all universes, but at this point it's just the same as Anselm's original ontological argument, not to mention the conclusion is part of the premise.

So here it is dumbed down:

1. If God necessarily exists, then he exists.
2. It is possible God necessarily exists.
3. Therefore, God exists.

Nice try.

Last time, people said I was attacking modal logic itself. I don't know if that's the case. I'm definitely attacking this usage of it. I don't think modal logic is invalid if possible worlds are complete independent realities, though of course this argument isn't useful anymore. I also think modal logic is just more than possible worlds, though to be honest I haven't seen examples of its use in other arguments.

Edit: Not to mention I could just change the definition of ""maximally excellent"". Also, in several versions of this argument, it states God ""necessarily exists"" *because* he's maximally great, instead of the other way around.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,1343840570.0,,,True,t3_xi5so,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/xi5so/the_problem_with_the_modal_ontological_argument/,

Another friend of his responded with this:

&gt;For one thing, informed Darwinists will admit that evolution on the ""macro"" scale cannot be observed in principle because of the vast amounts of time involved. It must be inferred from fossils and other forms of evidence (such as ""micro"" evolution, comparative anatomy, etc.), which can still potentially be valid but is far different from direct observation.

&gt;Whether large-scale evolution has occurred isn't really a question of speciation, but of information. Any isolated breeding group that will not breed with other groups can be defined as a separate species, so not much change has to occur for ""speciation"" to have occurred. What is more significant is what kind of change has occurred, specifically to the genetic information. For the change to occur from an ape-like common primate ancestor to modern humans (assuming there's about a 2% difference in our genetic information), millions of beneficial genetic changes would first have to occur, then be significant enough to survival to be selected, then spread throughout the population enough so as not to be lost. All this was supposed to have happened in a few million years. Even if these sorts of genetic changes were common, which they aren't, there wasn't enough time or generations of the species for that sort of change to occur.

It seems like he admits that there is evidence for large scale change due to evolution but I am not sure how to answer the human question. I have a few thoughts but I wanted to see your guys' opinions. I also had a rough time finding sources for this topic specifically?

**Continued:**
His next response:

&gt;I don't think your definition of macro evolution is accurate, but like the term ""species,"" that term has no universally-agreed-upon definition. The point I was trying to make earlier is that because a ""new species"" (which can be defined as simply as an isolated breeding group) can be formed with almost no significant genetic change, this definition of macro-evolution is one that tells us almost nothing about how life went from a single organism to the extreme diversity we see today. I'm not trying to move the goal posts, just pointing out that a goal you score between these posts isn't worth very many points towards understanding how life developed.

&gt;The reason there would need to be so many changes is because of the size of primate genomes and the estimated 2-4% difference between those of humans and their closest living relatives. With the human genome having over 3 billion base pairs, the number of those that differ is in the tens of millions. For the millions, if not tens of millions, of changes to occur between humans and our primate ancestor, there would first have to be that many mutations, which take quite some time at 175 per generation (one estimate I found--http://www.genetics.org/content/156/1/297.full). In fact, to get a 2% change in 3 billion pairs at 175 changes per generation would take over 340,000 generations, and with large primates, a single generation can last many years. Considering how long it takes for humans to mature sexually, the closer you get to modern humans, the longer your generations become. And then there’s still the problem of those mutations catching on in the population so they will be built upon and not just diluted and lost. It could theoretically happen randomly through neutral changes to some degree. But by definition, neutral changes are those which natural selection, the driving force of evolution, cannot act on, because they do not significantly affect survival. So at that point it’s not even Darwinian evolution anymore, just dumb luck.

&gt;I am aware that single-point mutations are not the only mutations that occur. But first of all, the number of mutations per generation is always miniscule in comparison to the number of changes required to get the human genome from that of an ape-like ancestor. Second, no matter what kind of changes you have, they’re always random. If you expect random changes to produce great progress, you’re betting against the house. Even if a larger portion of the genome is somehow duplicated in one generation, all you get is the same information over again. It’s not a viable method for producing something like the human brain, which as far as we know is the greatest supercomputer in existence, no matter how much time you have.

&gt;I think that a better explanation for machinery far more complex that what the best human minds have ever been able to come up with is a designer with a mind far greater than those of humans. But what I believe is irrelevant. Scientific theories aren’t innocent until proven guilty. Whether they offer a good explanation does not depend on whether there are any better explanations available. Of course, Darwinism explains a lot about life. Just not about how it could have come into existence and become what we see today all by itself.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,1339544045.0,,,True,t3_uweiw,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/uweiw/human_evolution/,
1335466349.0,9,self.DebateAnAtheist,styp3,My father and I just had a long and interesting conversation about the conflict between Science and Religion. He says there isn't one and provides an interesting thought... (X-post from r/atheism),lonelyonlyleft,19,10,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/styp3/my_father_and_i_just_had_a_long_and_interesting/,"My father is a High School teacher (possibly one of the most well-read people I know) and for 20 years taught Biology and Chemistry. After a transfer he was put in a position to teach Religion (Catholic HS, we're Catholics). He says that this switch has opened his eyes to a new realm of possibility after struggling for so long with faith and science.

He offered an argument put forth by a Jesuit priest, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The Jesuit order is an order of thinkers and scientists, they are the ones who have brought much of scientific understanding and acceptance to the church. His argument, from early in the 20th century, is that Religion and Science are NOT competing ideologies but rather parallel ideologies. He says that Christ is not just an anthropological event but also a cosmic phenomenon as well. I quote:

""Simply put, when a dead body is raised to new life the physical structure of the universe is being altered, atoms and molecules are being rearranged. Thus Jesus' resurrection is about more than simply new hope being born inside of human consciousness. It is also about the future of this planet.

The resurrection opens us to possibilities beyond this life. It gives us a meta-future. But it gives a meta-future to the world, our planet, as well. Ultimately we, human persons, are only that part of God's creation that has become self-conscious and we do not stand apart from the earth and it does not exist simply for our benefit, like a stage for the actor, to be abandoned after the show. Physical creation has value in itself, independent of us.

Moreover, like us, the earth is also time-bound, mortal, subject to decay, dying. Science clearly teaches us this. The laws of entropy tell us that the universe is running down, the sun is burning out, all energy is finite. The earth's days are numbered, counted. It will take millions of years but finitude is finitude. Like us, it too will die.

This is what St Paul refers to in the Epistle to the Romans when he tells us that creation is subject to futility and, like humanity itself, is groaning and longing to be set free from its bondage to decay so as to enjoy the glorious liberty of the children of God.

The resurrection brought into our world a new power, a new arrangement of things, a new hope, and something so radically novel that it can only be compared to what happened at the initial creation when our universe first started. At the dawn of creation the atoms and molecules of this universe were made out of nothing, ex nihilo, nature took shape, and its reality and physical laws held sway from then on - until the resurrection of Jesus.

In the resurrection of Jesus the very atoms of the universe were rearranged. The laws of physics were somehow stunningly altered and because of that our planet now too has the possibility of eternal life.""

So in theory, when Jesus rose, his atoms and molecules were changed to pure energy. He at that moment ceased to exist in our plane, but rather in a parallel dimension, not consisting of physical atoms how we understand them, but as forms of energy. When he appeared to his apostles and then vanished he brought with him hope for life beyond the physical existence that we currently understand. Words did not exist to explain it properly either. If you read Genesis, the descriptions are vague; (Gen 1:2) ""Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit hovered over the water."" For Moses, this was the best way he could communicate this strange and novel form of understanding.

Similarly, with science, we are constantly trying to uncover understanding of the world we live in. We are not supposed to be able to understand it all right away, and only through invention and deep study do we reveal small aspects of our incredible complexity. In this light, Science and Religion are parallel. Burden of proof is not an appropriate argument because it cuts both ways.

A belief in life after death then is reasonable if we consider a meta-physical transformation of matter into energy. Time therefore is the only thing binding us to our physical reality. Once time is over there will be nothing, like there was before creation.

Inhabiting eternity, outside of time, God is able to know what happens before it happens. 

He is also able to communicate that to mankind, as claimed by the Bible.  Of course, these ""predictions"" must come true if God is true.  In my opinion, the prophecies of the Messiah provide such a unique evidence that even a superficial inquiry can lead to faith in an all-knowing God.

So yes I believe it does instruct us (Christians) to prevent women from preaching within the Church, but does not necessarily stop women from claiming any occupation outside of administrative roles in the church. Any thoughts?

Hume best describes this, but I believe many modern atheists would agree that faith is a leap outside of reason and cannot be reasoned to. In the case of atheism, it is faith namely in God. 

Protestants are represented by Martin Luther and Kierkegaard. Martin Luther, following the tradition of William of Ockham, was a nominalist, who believed the concept of forms was just a nomen (name). Reason, he concludes is an unworthy guide, blinded by sin, incapable of getting to God, but we should trust in God (blind leap against reason). Kierkegaard, in Fear and Trembling, reemphasizes this by putting a distinction between the knight of infinite resignation (the moral person without faith) and the knight of faith. The latter is praised and seen as happier, although more misunderstood (seemingly because of the leap which is central to his philosophy.)

Would you guys agree, atheists and Protestants? Is faith a leap that deals with things outside of the realm of reason, or is outright unreasonable? Is faith characterized by a blind trust in God.


Edit : So, it seems that, regardless of the two down votes, everyone (that is, atheists and Protestants) agree that faith is a blind leap of faith. It seems that Kierkegaard and Hume would be in a dialogue, and they both agree, faith is a blind leap. Kierkegaard says ""make the leap"" while Hume says ""it is not reasonable to make the blind leap"" but there is agreement, it is a blind leap.

What if I said that faith is not a blind leap, but rather a reasoned leap, where philosophical analysis of the world would lead you to the cusp of the supernatural and that the leap is not so much a leap, since, for us humans, we are both natural and supernatural. That it is not a leap from some thing to another, but the accepting of a supernatural gift. We already live in the supernatural, so it's not some sort of qualitative change. Rather, Faith is just a gift in a realm we exist in. Furthermore, God is not unknowable to reason, but rather reason speaks about God, in his singularity, simplicity, and role as creator? Basically, that God, and the Christian faith isn't based on a blind trust in a Bible, but that Christian faith fulfills what is reasonable? That history, reason, desires, ethics, the nature of the world, and cosmology all speak to God's existence and no Bible is necessary to get to that conclusion. Is that an understanding of faith that is presented to you? Or is it always a blind leap?

What do you think?,Quest4truth11,13,2,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/ol56o/ongoing_debate_with_christian_on_the_reliability/,"Sorry for the length, it is a good discussion. Hope you will read it and offer your opinion.
This is his complete e-mail to me, his rebuttal to my points from a previous e-mail. This is not a back and forth discussion. I wrote ""Me"" in all the parts where he is quoting me to rebut my points to try to make it less confusing.

ME (skeptical stance):
“I want to clarify something from my last e-mail that I think was misunderstood. I did not mean to say that there are no outside sources that mention Jesus, I know that there are a lot. What I meant was that there are no outside sources written within his lifetime, and the only independent (outside) sources that were written were late enough that they were likely written based on hearsay passed by Christians.”

Christian:
When you consider that Jesus' active ministry lasted roughly three years, there was not much time for written reports to circulate during Jesus' actual living ministry. The much larger issue here, is the complete lack of understanding of how ancient (and modern) cultures used oral tradition. Several major studies have demonstrated that cultures like that of the Jewish culture of the first century were very capable of passing along information with great accuracy. In fact, the gospel record is technically considered oral history as opposed to oral tradition because it contains information passed down by living witnesses. One of the classic studies on this matter is by Swedish scholar Birger Gerhardsson - 
http://www.amazon.com/Reliability-Gospel-Tradition-Birger-Gerhardsson/dp/1565636678/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1326822283&amp;sr=8-2-fkmr1

So the idea that the gospels contain hearsay written too late to be reliable is simply false.

I think many of your comments reflect a certain chronological snobbery that virtually equates ""ancient"" with ""ignorant"" or ""supersitious."" And your default view seems to be that ancient people were not capable of passing along and preserving accurate history. This reflects an ethnocentric bias which is common, one that presumes we modern people with our technology are so much superior. I don't think that mentality stands up to scrutiny though.


 ME (skeptical stance):
“The earliest writings we have referencing Jesus are the biased Christian sources of the gospels and the letters. The reason that is significant is because while Jesus was alive he was said to have wide fame, and yet there was no independent writer at the time alive to personally attest to Jesus having done these things, or to his fame, or even to call him a popular magician or anything. All we have from people that claim to have actually seen him are some debatable letters (as to who wrote them) that say little about him,  Paul's letters (who didn't see Jesus, but knew people who claimed they had,) and maybe the gospel of John written by an eyewitness (though, also highly debated). These are all biased sources written by people with the intent of spreading Christianity. And we know and can observe everyday people who fib a little in order to spread the greater good, or to spread their agenda. I am not saying Paul did that, I'm just saying we don't know who did that Paul may have believed since he knew them to be a follower of Jesus.”
 
Christian:
Once again you raise the issue of ""bias."" There is no such thing as ""unbiased"" history. All history is written from a point of view. Do you think the hyper-skeptics that you have read (like Robert Price) are unbiased? So let's set aside the matter of agenda, since all history has an agenda. This doesn't mean that all history is therefore unreliable. A Jewish historian writing about the Holocaust is hardly expected to be unbiased. But they are expected to follow the canons of reliable history. As I explained in my last email, the gospels certainly qualify in that regard.

Second, if reliability depends on being a contemporary of the subject, you are excluding virtually all ""history"" writing. Josephus was born around the time of Jesus' death - is he excluded because he wasn't alive when Jesus was? If so, how many of the biographies in your bookcase would have to be dismissed as reliable? 

 
ME:
Paul says he knew the people who knew Jesus, but there is discrepancy between his letters and what the gospels (including John) say about Jesus's appearances, such as who saw Jesus, who are the disciples verses ""the twelve,"" what were the happenings based on that incident and such. Paul says nothing about the happenings around the empty tomb. Paul, the only writer that we can confirm to have known the people who knew Jesus is the one that had the littlest to say about Jesus' actual physical life on earth. Yes, it could be that he didn't mention them because that was already known information at the time, and his point was to address the Christians who already believed, but still, it leaves the closest definite source to Jesus lacking in real, physical attestation to him. To me it seems very plausible, and even probable, that the people Paul spoke to who were spreading Christianity could very easily have known Jesus, wanted to spread Jesus' teachings, may have believed he was seen again, and in order to spread the teachings had to convince themselves and others that this was all true, even to where details get distorted in their minds, and any doubts are cleared by their strong desire to believe and justify their beliefs. Just like people today can believe they've seen a dead relative come back to life, even in group settings. Also, some sitings could have been rumor. (people who want to believe a rumor are known to believe it even if there is no proof) The fact that Jesus was baptized according to the criteria of self-damaging details, and that he couldn't do miracles in Nazareth (where his relatives would have actually seen him) just makes it seem more likely that these are the true details and Jesus may not have really been the miracle worker that the gospels put forth. It was probably miracles of the likes that the holy rollers today perform ""miracles"" of healing and growing limbs, curing disease, that becomes largely exaggerated.  Plus, the women were not the only ones to attest to Jesus rising from the dead. The gospels indicate that they were the first ones to come to the tomb, but they ran back and told the disciples who ran back and confirmed it. I do not find the testimony of women to be so self damaging whether made up or not. Especially since this religion was to appeal to the women better than other cults of the time, and better than Judaism, and since they made sure to have Peter and John confirm the empty tomb as well. 

Christian:
Several things:
1.  What discrepancies are there between Paul's letters and the gospels?
2.  Where are you getting evidence that Paul is the only one we can confirm who knew people who knew Jesus? This is a bizarre claim. I don't know of any scholar who denies Mark knew Peter, for instance.
3.  The reason you don't find the evidence of the women self-damaging is because you are reading the accounts with no knowledge of the beliefs and practices of the first century. This is a widely commented on detail acknowledged by scholars on all points of the spectrum.

 ME:
“You said:
'As far as elaboration goes, I would point you to 1 Cor. 7:10-11, where Paul careful distinguishes what Jesus said from what he says. He did not feel at liberty to simply make up whatever he wanted. The evidence is that the early Christians were careful to preserve what the handed down from Jesus.'

Yes, you are right that Paul did make sure of this to the best of his ability. Where did he get his information on what Jesus said? From people that knew Jesus? Maybe. From the forming tradition about Jesus' sayings? Maybe. Does this mean, however, that Jesus was the son of God? I don't think we have enough to confirm that. More likely, an eloquent teacher and leader that had a bit of a following, who was crucified and shortly afterward thought to have been seen alive. Thus, many of his sayings were preserved from memory, and eventually written down, the story of his life became exaggerated by his followers. His appearances, the manner of them, the empty tomb, some based in fact, some exaggerated story-telling. Which is which? I don't think we can ever really know. With faith you have to erase all doubt and shut your mind from the opposition. Faith means you must believe even though you can't know for sure because there is no proof, so block out the contradictory evidence and only look at the supporting evidence so that you can be convinced of it. I have looked at the supporting evidence and find it likely that the same thing happened around these events that happens today with superstitious, fallible people. If all you have attesting to Jesus' resurrection and god-hood are biased sources, you have a lot of room for doubt. So much, that I find it very difficult to appeal to faith anymore.”

Christian: 
Once again, your comment about ""biased sources"" reflects an incredibly naive view of history. The same is true with your comments about the evidence. You said, ""you can't know for sure because there is no proof."" Really? You think there is ""no proof? No evidence at all? 

If what you mean is that the resurrection of Jesus can't be proven like 2+2 = 4, you are of course right. But that is not how history works. History is a cumulative case, where you add up all the evidence and then draw what is the most likely conclusion. And based on all the evidence we have at our disposal, the most likely conclusion is that Jesus rose from the dead. You may draw a different conclusion, but you can't simply say ""there is no proof.""

2. If God ""sees all"", he is able to see the cause and effect relationship in every thing.
3. Therefore, if premise (1) is true, God has a perfect understanding of causality.

5. Therefore, God must have knowledge of all time: past, present and future.

8. Humans are a part of the universe.
9. If (7) and (8) are true, during creation, God created every human life precisely as it would be in the future.
10. Therefore, every human action is predetermined and the result of God's creation.
11. However, God expects moral accountability in humans.
12. For accountability, there must be free will.
13. If (10) is true, human action is not the result of free will but of God's plan.
14. Therefore, there is no free will.
15. If (12) and (14) are true, God cannot hold us accountable for our actions.
16. But he does.
17. For (10) to be true, either (1) or (6) must be false.

Until very recently, in most (all?) groups of people, religion has been central to the organization of society.

Religion's functional definition has nothing to do with any particular belief. Rather, it is something that encourages each family to take a son out of the fields and put him in a school or monastery. The question of sincere belief is barely relevant, as 15 years in school is a formative experience for anyone, no matter if his heart is in it or not.

Religious beliefs and practices are arbitrary. Their arbitrariness makes it possible to maintain an esoteric tradition, which is useful for distinguishing between allies and outsiders. 

Religious beliefs and practices are complex. Their complexity serves as a form of indoctrination, requiring a class of scholar priests who, in most cases, maintain the oral tradition. In some special cases, like those of Judaism, Christianity, and Buddhism, that priestly class evolved into today's academic class.

(An example of a similar, secular phenomenon: Chinese characters, which are complex beyond all reason, serve to make literacy in China a form of cultural indoctrination. That is, you can't learn Chinese characters well without being -- becoming -- Chinese, in a sense. When the Mongols conquered China, they put on Chinese clothes and adopted Chinese rites. They didn't do the same in Hungary.)

Science is not arbitrary, but its scope is vast and layered. It is fantastically complex, too. So, a question:

Can a modern human society be stably arranged around the pursuit of science? How will the Enlightenment, whose lineage goes straight back to Europe's monastic tradition, pan out? Is there hope for a global society that does not hold arbitrary beliefs at its core?

A tangential question: If the U.S. is an experiment in creating an Enlightened society, what does it mean that our Declaration of Independence is filled with religious references, yet our Constitution has none?

I'm not religious, myself, and I've never encountered religious hostility. Apart from America's batshit Protestant death cult, I am very sympathetic to religious thinking in all its forms, and I'm ambivalent about science usurping upon the diversity of human thought, though I recognize it's inevitable.

In short: the metaphysical conception that all metaphysics is invalid. Let’s be clear, methodological materialism is warranted within science, but ontological materialism cannot be proven scientifically. Therefore, I’d like to frame this discussion *beyond* science, because science itself is not without unresolved issues. Like: what is the foundation for science? Can science prove itself? Does it provide 'true' knowledge (in a metaphysical sense)? How valid is scientific knowledge? Even the debate what constitutes real science over and against pseudo-science is far from settled.

This is the conclusion I've reached so far.  Feel free to poke holes in it.


Agnosticism:  the view that the truth value of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity, but also other religious and metaphysical claims—is unknown or unknowable.

1) Any positive claim for the existence of a diety must set an operating definition for said diety.  For example, saying that 'god' could be anything, like a cat, or a pot, or some sort of metaphysical noncorporeal energy is completely nonsensical.  If god were cat, then we would call it a cat and not god.  An operating definition MUST be stated for said diety, like saying the Christian God exists, or the Muslim God exists, or the Hindu Gods exist.  

EDIT:  Again, I must stress the importance of having a definition.   A lot of agnostics are saying things like 'well what if god is something completely incomprehensible?'  The point is that you have to be able to articulate what you think god is.  Otherwise it is no different than saying well what if god is a cat or a ball or a tennis racket or any other inane nonsensical object.

2) Said operating definition will set certain observable conditions.  For example, making a positive claim that the Christian God exists implies that there was a Great Flood, a Garden of Eden, or that Jesus existed historically.  Obviously, similar conditions will be set for other dieties.

3) These observable conditions can therefore be disproven.  This is a condition where the absence of evidence actually IS evidence of absence.   For example, the complete lack of geologic evidence for the Great Flood (for which there would be ample evidence if it was true) counts as direct evidence against the existence of the Christian God.
     
   3a) If the diety in question is one who does not interact with or intevene in the Universe in any way shape or form, 
and will therefore never set any observable conditions that would provide evidence for or against its existence, 
then the diety may as well not exist anyway, 
and it becomes a moot point in the first place.  This is a borderline nonsensical position.

4) Therefore, it is possible to know whether or not a god exists because it will always set observable conditions which can then be directly disproven.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,True,,,True,t3_neucu,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/neucu/agnosticism_an_untenable_position/,

&gt;Fathers and teachers forgive my tears now for all my childhood rises up again before me and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then awe and wonder and gladness. The camels at that time caught my imagination and Satan who talked like that with God, and God who gave His servant (Job) up to destruction, and His servant crying out: ""Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish me,"" and then the soft and sweet singing in the Church: ""Let my prayer rise up before Thee,"" and again incense from the priest's censer and the kneeling and the prayer. Ever since then -only yesterday I took it up- I ve never been able to read that sacred tale without tears. And how much that is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame, proud words, ""How could God give up the most loved of His saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him his children, smite him with soje boils so that he cleansed the corruption from his sores with a potsherd - and for no object except to boast to the devil 'See what My saint can suffer for My sake'"". But the greatness of it lies just in the fact that it is a mystery - that the earthly show and the eternal verity are brought together in it.

The hypothesis goes like this : Jesus was a ""Ghandi-like"" figure that strongly believed in the freedom of the Jewish people from the oppression of the Roman empire. After ~300 years of communicating the story of Jesus' martyrdom for Jerusalem, the story became increasingly warped during each generation before the canonized books were written. At that time, Jesus' story had transformed to a political martyr to that of the son of a god, specially the one of the Jewish faith. So the Catholic Church canonized the books following this message as closely as possible (explaining why Gnosticism would be viewed as heresy. )

I just watched Lawrence M. Krauss' presentation A Universe From Nothing, and I've read basically the same thing in one of Brian Greene's books, in which he discusses how a flat universe has zero total energy, and thus can come from total nothingness, eliminating the need for a creator deity. But really this sets the question back a step, doesn't it? Why do these quantum laws exist that allow the universe to come into being? 

I'm not arguing the existence of physical laws in itself is proof a deity, but it does seem to me that the intricate and subtle laws that govern universe are the sort of thing that could have been guided by an intelligence, as opposed to springing full formed from nothingness.

I assume you guys will go for the latter, but most of the stuff I see on r/atheism talks about arguments with Christians or the religious right and so on. (I've yet to see a post about an atheist having a fffffffuuuuu moment with a liberal Jew for example. Maybe this will be it ;) ) 

In my view, by definition there can be no proof God exists. So I think all these proof posts are silly. I also don't go literal in terms of textual support. So I think that all the ""the bible says X"" posts are silly. I just believe in the existence of an all powerful. I suppose the atheist response is that you just don't believe.

1). Energy is eternal (has always existed without cause or agency)
2). Energy came from nothing (non-existence)
3). Energy was created (by something with the ability to create energy).

Fundamentally, the theist position is number 3. All things (ie energy) were created.

The atheist (perhaps strong atheist) position is that there is no creator and therefore refutes number 3, leaving only 1 and 2.

There is no evidence to support number 1, 2 or 3. Therefore, doesn't discounting any one of the three premises equate to believing in the likelihood of either of the remaining two.

I apologize if this isn’t the most appropriate place to bring this up, but I could not think of a better subreddit.  I'd like to get a dialog going about your debate style(s).  As someone who has never been on a ""debate team"", nor has had any formal training in debating, I am curious as to how you approach these religious debates/conversations. While I’m mostly referring to live conversation (not online/forum posts) any insight is appreciated.

Like many of you, I have watched various religious debates online (Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris, etc.) and as such, I’ve been able to get a sense of how each person approaches the debate, both in style and composure. Also, I believe I’ve watched enough to give me the overall feel of the “atheists vs religious” debate landscape: what arguments to generally expect from religious people, how they might frame it and what information is important to know going in. 

So now I find myself at the point where I feel like I have plenty of information, but none of the delivery. In the very few times I’ve been in these types of conversations, I *feel like* my delivery is calm and collected, but really it just seems to come out more agitated and terse. Naturally, these debate-style issues online are more easily resolved as one can take all the time one wants to craft an answer and word it just the way you like.

I acknowledge that the calmness and collectedness of various debaters is in part simply due to experience. However, I imagine there are some techniques or tips one could learn to help establish this. So now I ask: what is your style when debating someone in person? What’s a good strategy for to keep your head cool and focused so you can make your points clearly and succinctly? 

TL;DR- How can one learn to debate in a style like Sam Harris’?

I've been a very solid atheist for 3 years now and I feel more strongly than ever that I've lost something.

Belief in God gave me strength when I had none and comforted me in hard times.  I never felt fearful for my future as my life was under the guidance of God.  Whenever I felt lonely I reminded myself that my best friend, the creator of the universe, was right there with me and that he loved me more than I could imagine.  I also loved the easy answers to questions of objective morality, purpose and meaning.  Those things were all defined by God, and I didn't need to worry about them.  I just needed to follow his guidance.

The majority of my discussion with christians is most definitely motivated by a sort of desperate search for something I missed, something that points to the existence of God and shows me that all those comforting feelings are well justified, and that all my old 'evidence' for God wasn't just smoke and mirrors.

I am reading another chapter and was wondering what some of you thought of this.

For context, I am in Chapter 8, page 143 of Wayne Grudem's book ""*Bible Doctrine*"". The title of the chapter is God's Providence.

This section is talking about God's Providence, specifically his *Preservation* of all created things. Preservation in this section is defined as *God keeps all created things existing and maintaining the properties with which he created them.* Some verses he uses to cite this position are [Hebrews 1:3 and Colossians 1:17](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hebrews%201:3;Col%201:17&amp;version=ESV).

Here is the text in question:

&gt;God, in preserving all things he has made, also causes them to maintain the properties with which he created them. God preserves water in such a way that it continues to act like water. He causes grass to continue to act like grass, with all its distinctive characteristics. He causes the paper on which this sentence is written to continue to act like paper - so that it does not spontaneously dissolve into water and float away or change into a living thing and begin to grow! Until it is acted on by some other part of creation and thereby its properties are changed (for instance, until it is burned with fire and becomes ash), this paper will continue to act like paper so long as God preserves the earth and the creation he has made.

&gt;God's providence provides a basis for science: God has made and continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways. If a scientific experiment gives a certain result today, then we can have confidence that (if all factors are the same) it will give the same result tomorrow and a hundred years from tomorrow. The doctrine of providence also provides a foundation for technology: I can be confident that gasoline will make my car run today just as it did yesterday, not simply because ""it has always worked that way,"" but because God's providence sustains a universe in which created things maintain the properties with which he created them.

**3. Ethical beliefs**

You cant show by science whether the Nazi scientists did anything worse than the American scientists in WWII or otherwise.

**4. Aesthetic judgments**

The beautiful, like the good cannot be scientifically tested.

**5. Science itself**

Science itself cannot be justified by the scientific method that would be circular reasoning.

Let me know what you think. I posted this in /r/TrueAtheism a few weeks ago, but it didn't generate a very good discussion.

**The problem of suffering**

*1a. G-d is omnipotent.*

*2a.  G-d is omnibenevolent (a perfect moral being).*

*3a. An omnipotent, omnibenevolent being would not allow suffering to exist.*

*4a.  Suffering exists.*


By (3a), (1a) and (2a) lead to a contradiction with 4a. This is a common and powerful argument against theism.



**A possible response**

*1b. Given the power to do so, it is morally imperative to choose non-existence (of the universe) over an existence with suffering (this is a reworking of 3a, above).*

*2b. By (1), a person with the power to do so (e.g., someone with access to a large nuclear arsenal) would be morally obligated to destroy the world.*

(2b) is an absurd proposition. By reductio ad absurdum, (1b) is shown to be false. Therefore, though valid, the problem of evil argument is unsound because it is based on false assumptions.

By the numbers, about 11,000,000 people (less than 0.5% of the world population) have accepted Mormon truth claims, as a result of extensive missionary efforts over a period of 170+ years. General estimates are that about 1/3 of this number are active, practicing members.

It occurred to me today that real truth might spread much faster and ""stick"" better: Practically the whole world has ""converted"" to the revolutionary and paradigm-shifting truths of

* The Circulatory System
* The Germ Theory of Disease
* Quantum Mechanics
* General Relativity (see GPS)

It's an interesting hypothesis (to me), but I'm having a hard time estimating the ""speed"" of truth. Wikipedia cites the ""first"" reference to a circulatory system as 1600 BCE, which would indicate a certain ""slowness"".

1352011897.0,9,self.DebateAnAtheist,12lqin,Is it logical to believe in God? Let's discuss.,PandemoniumExpress,29,20,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/12lqin/is_it_logical_to_believe_in_god_lets_discuss/,"So let's talk about how it is, in my opinion, logical to believe in God. Yes, I know some -- if not all -- non-religious people are probably bewildered by this idea, but I feel this is worth discussing. So, let's begin.

I would like to start out by saying that I am, in fact, a religious person. However, as a religious person, I feel that I understand the rationale of atheists/non-religious people. I can see why you, if you are a non-believer, would look at religious oppression throughout history, ignorance, outlandish beliefs, the concept of prayer, the veracities of science, anti-abortion movements, anti-gay marriage laws, racism, hatred, murder, torture, etc., as being sufficient evidence to say, ""are you kidding me? I'm supposed to follow those beliefs to get into Heaven?"" Moreover, the mere concept of a being whom we cannot see, and whose existence we can neither prove nor disprove, is supposed to be our omnipotent ruler? Now, I, a religious man, intentionally wrote that long list of reasons to not believe, because despite all that, I still find that it is logical to believe in God/gods.

I read r/Atheism every now and then, just to get a better understanding of the other side of the belief spectrum. However, I am unable to discern whether the people in r/Atheism and/or atheists/non-religious people don't want to be bothered with religious ideas, or if they are openly opposed to religion. In either case, I believe religion is here to stay. Religion will prove to be as risilient as mankind itself, even if there is no God/gods. I say this because some people will believe because they want to believe. Some people just won't accept the idea that maybe death really is the absolute end of us. Additionally, some people, myself included, find peace and happiness in religious beliefs.

Now, let me get to the logical side of this argument. Yes, maybe I will spend my entire life exerting my efforts and making sacrifices for my religion in order to be righteous, and this could all turn out to be pointless because maybe there really is no God. However, that doesn't much matter to me, because I still find increased happiness in my religion, and of nothing happens when I die, how would I be capable of caring that I wasted my efforts? On the contrary, if there really is a God, what would you, if you currently have no belief thereof, do? What do you think would happen to you, if you find out that there is a God, after all? 

I'm not going to say that atheists/non-religious people are going to be subject to Hellfire or eternal damnation, because I don't believe that's true. I believe that God, if he exists, is a merciful, forgiving, and loving God. And you may say, ""if he's so loving, why does he allow his so-called 'followers' to do so much wrong? And why would he allow things like disease, and poverty to happen?"" This is a tough question for me to answer. Not because I don't have an answer, but because I feel that if I explain it here, I will be ridiculed as a religious nut-case. Such an answer requires some degree of religious maturity to fully grasp. Regardless, this is a digression, but I will be glad to explain my answer to you if you would like to hear it.

Let me summarize, in the simplest way I can, why believing in God could be logical:

If I am religious, and God exists, then yippee!
If I am religious and I am happy because of it, and God doesn't exist, then so what?
If I am atheist/non-religious, and God doesn't exist, then yippee!
(don't stop reading after this next sentence, please. I still have a further argument to make)
If I am atheist/non-religious, and God does exist, then what now?

I'll concede that this logic is far too incomplete to make a viable argument, which is why I am going to further discuss it until I feel that I have a viable argument to make. 

I'm not saying that all religions are correct, for there are far too many religions out there that profess an ideology of hate and ignorance, or that are opressive and/or absolutely fraudulent. I will guarantee that those who follow such hateful religions, are not followers of God, if he exists, that is. Furthermore, I have found that people affiliated with those religions are not happy because of it. If you practice religion, you should only do so with the intent to do good, and to have a genuine love of all men. God does not hate anybody. He doesn't hate gays, he doesn't hate blacks. He loves everybody, and if any liturgical texts like the Bible are true, then God has not instructed anybody to hate another person. 

I know I am not perfect. I know that I can't say that I have a genuine love of all men, because I've made some enemies in my life, but I am trying to forgive them, and bury the hatchet. Furthermore, it is not sufficient to say that you have a genuine love of all men, if all you do is say, ""I have a genuine love of all men."" you have to express your love through your actions. I know the word love may seem a bit strange or uncomfortable to use, but that's really what we are supposed to do, if we are supposed to do anything at all. This is how religious practices should be, for this is the only way that you can be truly happy through religion, regardless of if it is true or not.

If you are wondering what my religious affiliation is, you might be surprised to learn that I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day saints, more colloquially known as the Mormon church. We are Christians in every sense of the word. And no, I do not find that my church is a cult. All that aside, let's discuss this idea a civil manner. I apologize if this post is full of lengthy paragraphs, grammatical errors, and/or spelling mistakes, but that's because I wrote this whole thing on an iPod, for it is the only internet accessible device that is available to me at this time. This wasn't supposed to be a long post, but I got a little carried away. And since I'm sick of tapping this little screen, I didn't exactly proofread. Sue me.

One of the most common criticisms of religion in general is that it requires having beliefs based on faith; that is, with no evidence at all to justify such beliefs. When religious people respond to atheists telling them that their belief requires faith too, the most common response is that atheism is ""the lack of belief."" Now I totally understand the argument that you won't believe something unless there is evidence to support it, but do we not agree that that is quite a bit different than claiming to know that divine beings don't exist (stating it as if its fact)? To me it seems like the former is completely rational while the latter is much more faith based. 

This is my general argument in regards to this: There's evidence to indicate that the universe did have a beginning and the big bang is our best explanation for the ""event"" that brought forth our universe. However, this doesn't even come close to answering some important questions. What exactly caused the ""big bang""? How exactly do we find the answer to such a question without imposing the very characteristics of our universe on what was here prior? Anyway, we can only draw two general conclusions. The universe came from something or it came from nothing. *Something* can refer to literally anything from a deity to an alien race. The main point here is that any belief we take up on what was or wasn't here before our universe essentially requires faith because we simply don't know (yet at least). So for those atheists who take up assumptions on what was here before or claim to know there is no God(s) (or any other equivalent beings) how exactly do you hold on to such ideas if you simultaneously claim that you don't hold your beliefs based on faith? 

I ask this because I see the agnostic point of view as much more honest and rational although it is admittedly fence-sitting.

Second question and also completely unrelated. To you as atheists, does it matter more that an individual think critically about what he/she believes or are you generally more accepting of atheists in general regardless of their reasoning? I understand its hard to comprehend exactly what my question is so I will elaborate. I feel like there's a good number of people who consider themselves atheist, but for all the wrong reasons. They are confident in their atheism because 'it is backed by science,' but they are as scientifically ignorant as a fundamentalist christian. They typically adopt the mindset in their later teens when they express hedonism in its purest form and disregard religion because it makes them feel accountable for their actions. I talked about this to an atheist friend of mine and he initially dismissed it. He got back to me about a month later because he started to think I was right. So my question is simply what are your thoughts on these people? Do you find them just as ignorant as any religious individual or do you find yourself being more accepting of them in comparison?

**Edit**: For the most part there was some interesting discussion. My first question was mostly answered by people pointing out the difference between agnostic atheism vs. gnostic atheism. Some people pointed out an eternal universe is another way of explain anything pre-big bang. A few people took my second question as an attack and it was in no way intended to be.

I am agnostic.  I was ""born"" Methodist, took a ride down to almost being atheist.  When I was 16 I had an event.  I had a dream and it had felt so real that couldn't shake it. A week and a half or so this exact (to the detail) think happened. 

Whether or not you believe that I saw the future happen before it happened does not concern me because I *know* this event happened.

So I've experienced a premonition.  I wasn't like a prophecy of some importance to the world, just an event and it happened to coincide with a change in my life.

This leaves me with one or 2 possibilities in my mind.  There is no god but time is not an arrow and our understanding of physics isn't enough or that there is some type of prime mover.  Not an infallible entity with all these properties that are attributed to a god such as giving a shit about us puny inconsequential humans.  I may still be stuck on the before the universe question.  You can talk about dimensions and M-brane theory all you want about the pre-big bang what created the first universe and where did that come from.  The prevailing answer is nothing.  Although our universe may have came from nothing current theory suggest that its on the edge of another universe and the like but there are already other universes that came before it.

Until it can be proved that time can be manipulated backwards or the how did the first universe could into existence I don't feel I have a choice but to be agnostic.

Hey [Me],

You sounded very confident in your assertions that the Old Testament has nothing to do with Jesus so I am not sure you are open to anything that is contrary to that belief. Just in case you are open to it, read this small passage from the book of Isaiah (chapter 53) written some 800 years before Jesus lived. 

                
               *and the LORD has laid on him
                                the iniquity of us all.
                He was oppressed, and he was afflicted,
                                yet he opened not his mouth;
                like a lamb that is led to the slaughter,
                                and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent,
                                so he opened not his mouth.
                By oppression and judgment he was taken away;
                                and as for his generation, who considered
                that he was cut off out of the land of the living,
                                stricken for the transgression of my people?*
                


Here is a Wikipedia link to the chapter – you can see the authenticity of the book and how Judaism interprets the chapter today in that in refers to Israel not Jesus – what else are they going to do with it? Of course it helps to know that Jesus is the true Israel – the fulfillment of all the Old Testament. The Passover Lamb in Exodus, the Ram given to Abraham to foreshadow that God would have to supply the sacrifice to appease His wrath towards us and not Abraham sacrificing his “only son” Isaac or anything we could do.

I have no desire to debate whether your interpretation of an old testament verse actually references Jesus. Interpretations are subjective and can mean many different things to many people. If the passage speaks to you and says Jesus, okay. If to Judaism it says Israel, okay. It’s not something anyone can be right about, and honestly, it’s besides the point.

Specifically, I responded to something I heard about people in the Old Testament being Christians. I do not believe that is true. The major figures in the OT were from Israel, spoke Hebrew, and worshipped the Hebrew God Yahweh. They were Jews as I understand it. Which makes sense, since both Judaism and Christianity read from the Old Testament. And in this light, a criticism that Islam “apes” Christianity sounds ridiculous.

I mean no disrespect to your beliefs, and if I misunderstood, my bad and we can leave it at that.

Hey bro!

Just saw this (your emails go to my junk folder :) - just kidding, or am I…)

We don’t have to debate things bro – while I agree that interpretations can be subjective it doesn’t follow that there wouldn’t be a single, correct, objective interpretation. I mean you yourself have attempted to give an objective interpretation for all passages of scripture, “all are subjective and can mean many different things to many people – and it’s ok”. That is an absolute truth claim about the Bible that would be impossible to prove since your thesis would involve allowing contradictions, which is illogical. It’s a very postmodern way of looking at things – “what’s true for you is true for you, but may not be true for others.” This in turn leads to no truth at all – well expect for the fact that there would be a single, absolute truth claim left, “what’s true for you is true for you, but may not be true for others.” This statement of course would contradict itself making it an illogical statement and invalid for anyone that is seeking to be logical – unless of course you don’t adhere to reason. :) 

While you may fail to understand how Israelites in the Old Testament were, in essence, Christians it doesn’t mean that it’s not a fact. You may not understand (pi x pi)^pi = 1,329.489, but it doesn’t mean it isn’t a fact :) You do realize you also took information from the scriptures and stated objective truths about the them – OT figures were from Israel, spoke Hebrew, and worshipped the Hebrew God Yahweh. How is your interpretation of what you read not subjective? 

I still don’t follow how you have a problem with Islam or other religions that are similar to Christianity, like Mormonism or Jehovah’s Witness, couldn’t copy or ape Christianity since they came afterwards. 

Anyways, I didn’t take your comments as disrespectful any more than I would have taken disrespect if you couldn’t explain (pi x pi)^pi  . Since you were having trouble understanding a fact I was just trying to help explain things a little bit. I enjoy discussing these things and would be happy to continue, but if this isn’t appealing or interesting to you then don’t worry about it. :)

God creates man in his image with free-will to choose between the eternal potentiality of goodness or evil.

God creates man out of love. His loves compels him to create man as an independent entity.

Man's independence establishes his individual uniqueness set apart from all things (as opposed to a slave to the will of any other entity, including God)

Man is invited by God to seek him (goodness) and ultimately join him in heaven (a state of goodness that transcends evil).

Even while joining God, the soul of man remains an independent entity with the responsibility and power of transcending evil.

Even his most beautiful creation (lucifer) was subject to the potentiality of evil. Thus Man's soul in heaven, while transcending evil continues to have access to the potentiality of evil.

Thus, man's everlasting existence in the presence of God is shouldered with the responsibility of goodness.

As an independent entity, such responsibility demands informed consent.

Therefore evil (absence of goodness) is an ethical obligation.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_malnb,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/malnb/the_problem_of_evil_from_a_biblical_perspective/,

So let's take incest out of the question. If two blood relatives want to get married, and will not be inbreeding (which has measurable consequences, on which I base my moral opposition to the proposition), then on what grounds can I oppose them getting married?

I have no moral objections to polygamy, for example. And from the threads I've seen in the past, most atheists are on the same page. I don't personally think it's a great idea, but we obviously know that is not grounds to seek having something outlawed.

This is, of course, is ignoring all of the various (and frequently misquoted) arguments from authority that abound in this video.

I think the problem here is letting them define nature as the universe. Rather, the universe is a set of objects, the set itself could possibly be classified widely as ""nature"". If that is the case, the universe itself isn't bound by these rules that are inherent within it.

I disagree, but I'm having trouble demonstrating that *being ungrateful* (which is being lumped together with *failing to worship*) is not immoral. Discussing morality is not my strong point. Can anyone help?

The person I'm discussing this with is relatively intellectually honest, and I have a feeling that if I can clearly and succinctly explain how it's not immoral to withhold gratitude, it would really have a big impact.  

Edit: I think I should have put the whole argument in here, to give more context. Here it is:

&gt;What many people fail to realize is that the seriousness of a sin is determined not just by the type of act done but also by who the act is done against. Consider the act of killing someone (or something). If you kill a dangerous bacteria or virus such as the Ebola virus, you are not doing something wrong. In fact, you’re probably doing something good. If you kill an animal such as an innocent dog or cow, you are not really doing something good, although it is not necessarily bad. But if you kill an innocent human being (assuming there are no extenuating circumstances), then the act is very bad. 

&gt;What this shows is that how evil an act is, is determined not just by the type of act done but also who the act is done against. Now, if wronging a person (by killing them, stealing from them, etc.) is very serious because human beings have great value, how much more serious is it to wrong a being of infinite value and worth? It is unimaginably evil. That’s why it is so incredibly evil when people fail to give God the worship and glory that he is due. 

Edit 2: I argued that it can't be immoral, for most of the reasons mentioned in this thread, and he replied that he simply disagrees. Rather than get stuck there, I continued as follows:

&gt;For the sake of discussion, let's say we grant that it is immoral to withhold praise. I would still say it only applies to those who do so knowingly and consciously. 

&gt;I don't see how it can be immoral if they are unaware that their praise is required, such as when:

&gt;a. They are unaware of any god requiring their praise.

&gt;b. They are unconvinced that a god deserving of their praise exists.

&gt;c. They mistakenly give their praise to false god 'x' instead of true god 'y'.

One of the most common refuges of ""faith"" is ""Answered Prayer"", and while it's easy to say ""That's just confirmation bias and altered mental state,"" that kind of *dry* answer isn't very compelling in a debate.

I've been trying to come up with short, compelling examples of

1) Physiological responses that theists know aren't god  
or  
2) How confirmation bias combined with ignorance of physiological/neurological workings can lead us to believe that prayers are answered.

**Example 1:** [Lights behind your eyes](http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/content/latest-questions/question/2770/)

If you close your eyes and press your hands to them, you'll ""see"" lights.  This is a real experience, a real sensation that you've had.

If I tell you that those ""lights"" were really your eyes being pushed 'behind' the outline of your soul, so that you could *see* your soul, should you believe me?

**Example 2:** The confounded light switch

What if i told you that you can turn on the lights in most residential rooms just by willing it?  Here is my method:

1) Enter the room, stopping just past the doorway.  
2) Say ""I am willing the lights to rise!""  
3) Take one sideways step opposite the door hinges.  
4) Crouch.  
5) Lean your back against the wall to ""summon your energy"".  
6) Say ""Rise lights!""  
7) Slowly stand, maintaining contact between your back and the wall.  
8) Pay no attention to anything you may have bumped as you stood up with your back against the wall.  

If you find a room where this doesn't work, you're probably just not doing it right, or there isn't enough ""energy"" in the room.

What happened to his intellectual discipline that operated on evidence, reason and logic? He’s not been brainwashed, tricked or manipulated because he knows better than to let that happen to him. What new evidence was introduced into the mix that would make him change everything? It would have to be major evidence too, right? Yet it doesn’t appear that’s what happens. Again, we’re supposing he's considered the  evidence, data, study on both sides. So what catalyzes this complete and utter change in the atheist’s worldview? Christians have an explanation for this.

And this is just one example where you would have to accept consciousness as a kind of absolute, as being primary.

But if you believe in the primacy of consciousness, can you still call yourself an atheist?

If you place consciousness first, then you value complexity (life and consciousness), and from this a whole value system and moral code arises, not unlike the moral code we see in many religions. It demands compliance to a certain ethic, it requires a certain humility, moments of inner-reflection and allows for expressions of gratitude not unlike prayer and worship. Yet there is no 'man in the sky'.

Such a value system is not irrational at all. There is much theoretical support for the concept of a multiverse, including some of the greatest scientists alive today. The primacy of consciousness is natural, it is how we know the universe to exist, and expresses the same valuing of complexity that evolution apparently motivates us to seek. 

Many (most) theistic beliefs are difficult if not impossible to rationalize, and the atheists' reaction to these is certainly justified. But I can't see how an atheist could formulate *as much* antagonism towards someone who holds a consciousness-first value system - even though so many here seem so incredibly offended by the concept.

To summarize, the [following is the amendment](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Immigration/Text_of_Law_of_Return.html) made in concerning the law of return:  
  
----------------------------------------  
  
4A. (a) The rights of a Jew under this Law and the rights of an oleh under the Nationality Law, 5712-1952,*** as well as the rights of an oleh under any other enactment, are also vested in a child and a grandchild of a Jew, the spouse of a Jew, the spouse of a child of a Jew and the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew, except for a person who has been a Jew and has voluntarily changed his religion.  
  
(b) It shall be immaterial whether or not a Jew by whose right a right under subsection (a) is claimed is still alive and whether or not he has immigrated to Israel.  
  
(c) The restrictions and conditions prescribed in respect of a Jew or an oleh by or under this Law or by the enactments referred to in subsection (a) shall also apply to a person who claims a right under subsection (a).  
  
Definition  
  
4B. For the purposes of this Law, ""Jew"" means a person who was born of a Jewish mother or has become converted to Judaism and who is not a member of another religion.""

As can be seen, the law of return encompasses:

* the child of a Jew,  
* the grandchild of a Jew,  
* the spouse of a Jew,  
* the spouse of a child of a Jew,  
* the spouse of a grandchild of a Jew.  
  
I know that there is discussion over whether ""Jewishness"" is a religion or an ethnicity, but in the context of this law it is clearly referring to ""Jewishness"" as a religion, as it adds ""except for a person who has been a Jew and has voluntarily changed his religion"". Consequently, a Jew who has changed his religion voluntarily (not crypto-Jews) is not included in the list of persons given Israeli nationality.  
  
However, such a right of return is denied to Palestinians, be they Muslim, Christian or Druze.

I would like to hear from what seems to be an intelligent group of people whether this seems to be logically consistent. 

Assuming God is omniscient and omnipotent: 

Imagine God creates the Earth somehow. Let's say the big bang occurred. In order for this event to happen God would have to know the end result of the universe, since he is omniscient. Since God is not only omniscient but omnipotent he could have created Earth in any other way imaginable. He could have had a world created where water is purple, the moon is a bit closer and tides and therefore different, and lets say a day lasts for 50 hours. These are all ridiculous and insignificant aspects in and of themselves, but imagining they were all true one would come to the conclusion that the ""end set"" of Christians (ie the group of people going to heaven from a Christian theological perspective) would be different than the group of people going to heaven now as it stands (again, from a Christian theological perspective where heaven exists and only ""believers"" go). As is such, God thus would be directly determining who ultimately goes to heaven and humans have no free will.

In this documentary, one of the experts discusses how anyone with a decent lot in Rome gave very few fucks about the poor and destitute.  He said this was a very common attitude in non-monotheistic cultures – that sympathy was a trait that did not develop in the west until monotheism took hold.  That got me to thinking.

Imagine a world where there were never gods, that early consciousness decided to gauge its reality based on hard evidence rather than the supposed supernatural.  What might our society look like?  Would we be tighter socially?  Some kind of socialist utopia where everyone's needs are met equally.  I think that we might actually be less empathetic.  Without god(s) having influenced social morality, I see a world where evolution and darwinism are the guiding principles.  Where euthanasia is assumed for any creature that is not fit for life.  

Imagine a world where Hitler had not fucked up eugenics and we could have a conversation about it without being accused of genocidal leanings.  I'm picturing a situation of voluntary eugenics in which we decide which traits we want and which we don't, and from there voluntarily reproduce.  This doesn't mean you need to go childless, just that you don't need to be selfish about your genes.  Without gods, is it morally okay to take the reigns of evolution and voluntarily steers us into space and beyond?

These ideas aren't directly related to the existence of a deity, but are in part what led me away from the atheistic stance of materialism.

First off, here's David Chalmers addressing the [title question](http://www.closertotruth.com/video-profile/Does-Consciousness-Defeat-Materialism-David-Chalmers-/1172). He argues that the nature of consciousness is incompatible with a purely materialistic worldview. He also advocates the concept of [strong emergence](http://consc.net/papers/emergence.pdf) as applied to consciousness. Chalmers argues that consciousness probably is strongly emergent. If so, then consciousness is probably not solely brain generated.

Fitting in with the idea of an irreducible and strongly emerging consciousness is the transmission model. Chris Carter explains and makes his case for the [model](http://www.parapsychologyandtheskeptics.com/Does-consciousness.pdf). Basically it suggests that the brain does not function as a generator of consciousness, but instead as a filter. And another good [article](http://www.bernardokastrup.com/2011/11/consciousness-and-memory.html) on the implications of and possible evidence in support of the transmission model of consciousness. EDIT: Plus a short [follow-up](http://www.bernardokastrup.com/2012/01/wanted-new-paradigm-for-neuroscience.html).

I'm leaving the presentation of these ideas to people more eloquent than I, but I'd like to respond to any comments or criticisms regarding these links.

EDIT1: (+4 hours) As I found out in the thread, a better title would be, ""No priors for a god, or, why strong atheism?""

EDIT2: (+2 days) I suppose my original title is closer to what I meant. Agnosticism might be the wrong word, but it's the closest to what I'm trying to say. It's difficult to try to push for an idea when you don't have the language to convey it. What can I call this? Indeterminism is taken. Maybe Multivacism, after multivac's famous phrase ""insufficient data for a meaningful answer."" Can I coin that? Actually, Centrivism (as distinguished from centrism, the political stance) is probably better.

EDIT3: (+2 days) It's been a good discussion so far. Upvotes all around!

EDIT4: (+4 days) Through an [excellent discourse](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/mm654/no_priors_for_a_god_or_why_not_agnosticism/c324kbr) with Brian, I am happy to say that I have amended my views. The tl;dr of our discussion is that by the same logic to take an uncommitted position on the existence of a god (in the lack of evidence), one must take an uncommitted view on the existence of all things, including our day-to-day reality. Which remains a logically sound view, but one that is impossibly impractical, to the point of absurdity. So in the interest of sanity, my new default position on things which have no evidence is one of disbelief, not suspension of belief.

.....

""Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved.

To all the knowlege i have gained most scientists say that evolution is caused by minor mutations in species that is more favorable and promotes reproduction. Sexual reproduction became the most favorable among the most complex species because of being able to combine gene pools, however my question is how did asexual organisms evolve into extremely complex sexual organisms? I'm having trouble understanding how perfect sexual reproductive organisms evolved from asexual organisms through slight mutations over time. The way i see it is an organism would have to evolve in to two separate groups, male and female and then once fully evolved (which i would assume took a long time according to evolution) worked perfectly together and changed the species from asexual to sexual.



TL;DR sexual reproduction doesn't seem to follow evolution.

Generally, I have absolutely no issue with what a person believes as long as it does not infringe on the rights of others, or descend into attacks on anothers beliefs without precedent. I'm not sure if this is the case with /r/atheism, which can be needlessly provocative to insult, an having it on the frontpage asserts a certain position of a redditor where there was none before.

I would describe myself as agnostic, in the same vein as Neil deGrasse Tyson and Carl Sagan, and disagree with the reinterpretation of this word by modern atheism as falling within a broader category of either atheism or theism, as it does not take into account the cultural meaning of the words as developed over history beyond the literal meaning or dictiopnary definition, translated from greek or latin.

I see a middle ground between theism and atheism, which has also been asserted by dawkins scale of theistic probability, where god is equally likely and unlikely. To look at religion scientifically, without adequate means of experimenting on the theory, would require a null hypothesis to be adopted, which would be complete impartiality. Dawkins considers this to be ""intellectual cowardice"", but, and i mean this as no offence to atheists in general, I think he can be a bit egotistic and self-serving at times

I also believe that concepts such as beleive and god are largely too abstract and subjective to attach values to, and so cannot assert any further than ""it is unknown"".

Often to attempt discussion on this topic at /r/atheism, would be to told to visit the FAQ, or that you cannot have a value of 0 on a theistic scale, you must pick one side, hence probably the reason for /r/agnosticism or /r/ignosticism(which has as much activity as the gobi desert)

I was wondering if an atheist might consider this position of impartial agnosticism, and if they feel it has, in their eyes, credibility, and if not, why?

You see, most discussions with Atheists spark the presumed killer argument ""Prove it"" in the first few sentences. They have adapted all their thinking to rational, scientific forms and thus treat religion just like an object able to be measured. This goes as far as to taking a minority of crazy fundamentalists as measure for all of a religion and, for instance, assuming that every christian believes in a flying bearded man on a cloud.

However, most religious people know that faith can under no circumstances can be turned into knowledge by some factual proof (like actually discovering a cloud man would be possible). Since faith and knowledge are two ways to address entirely different capabilities of the human mind, they do not contradict, but much rather complement each other.

The sensation of faith is quite similar to the one of confidence, as the root word suggests. One can either have confidence in oneself or one can not. Personal experiences may play a role in either, but you can go from not being confident to the opposite by pure will without external input. 

Now, the next common question is, ""Why believe in a deity?"", as in, why not assume that the universe created itself from its own?
This seems to root on the assumption that belief addresses god as some sort of object. But this would disagree the premise that god was ""in the beginning"", say, the chaos, and works by putting things in order - what leads us to the conclusion that god is not some sort of container or puppet master, but much rather a principle of WHY (not: how, those are physics) things work. 

Now the argument may arise ""So what you call 'god' has no effect on humanity however, so why care?"" 
The situation is that humans can inspect their lives and ponder about it. The most important issue here is our mind, as everything we're able to perceive must be reflected through our mind. Now our society has a very extended source of scientific knowledge, what means, we have the possibility of going through life with the aid of technology and other people's discoveries. No need for god, one would say - and that might be true. But as noted before, people -choose- to believe. And the belief itself is a way of reflecting the principle of why everything works onto ourselves. It helps us viewing ourselves from the opposite viewpoint as science does and may provide an additional method of experiencing the core of our being. 

While Science addresses our factual understanding of the world, Religion offers the complimentary access to our emotions. Note: I'm not saying it would be the only way - But it offers a framework of well-tested methods of influencing our emotional well-being to the better, that also (at least where I live, America may be an exception) is recognized as a tradition in the society one lives in. One example may be the deep-rooted feeling of peace and serenity on christmas eve; the traditions here are not purely christian but go back to the very core of society where a light fest lighted up the darkest day of the year and brought families closer together.

So what I'm trying to bring across here is: Faith can not be confused with (or countered by) science, since it works on a whole other level. You can choose not to have faith and instead adapt other methods of learning about your self, but faith itself (fundamentalists do confuse faith with knowledge, whereas powerhungry leaders misuse religion for their politic interests) does not interfere with the revelations science offers humanity.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_jyvog,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/jyvog/the_difference_between_belief_and_knowledge_or/,

Came across this book recently, and decided that I should post some passages here to see what comes out of it.  So, do you agree?  Disagree? Why?

Under ""A Scientific Reason:""
""...Consider putting various bits of metal into a barrel and shaking it for a million years. What are the chances of forming a wristwatch?  And if the millions of years turned out to be billions, would your chance be greater?
  Remember that a single cell has much more complexity than the initials of your name or even a wristwatch...
  To assume that all of this was put together by chance is beyond belief.  The late H. Quastler calculated the odds as 1 in 10 with 301 zeros.  Mathematically that is the equivalent of believing that there was an explosion in a print factory and the result was a Webster""s dictionary! It does not matter how much time we give nature; the huge numerical odds simply are irrelevant: we must simply admit that no matter how much time and how much luck, evolution could not have happened.""

Now, the obvious flaw in logic that I see is that a wristwatch is a fully functioning, designed piece of machinery.  If you're looking for random chance to make a bunch of metal come together into a specific piece, then of course it is pretty much impossible.  But evolution has no master plan that it is trying to achieve.  It all started from chemistry, and the molecules that were best at reproducing themselves did just that.  There was no great design or blueprint to result in a human being.  Furthermore, evolutionary theory doesn't state that a bunch of organs floated around in a primordial soup and collided until a human was created.

I don't know much about these things, so I relied heavily on freethoughtpedia.

""When you add up all of the facts, the case for the existence of Jesus as an historical person becomes rather remote:

There are no proven, legitimate references to the existence of Jesus in any contemporary source outside of the New Testament (which is really not a contemporary source, as it was written from 30 to 70 years after Jesus supposedly died),

There is no evidence that the town of Nazareth, from which Jesus' mother supposedly came, ever existed at the time he was supposedly living there,
The existence of Jesus is not necessary to explain the origin or growth of Christianity (were the Hindu gods real'?),

The New Testament accounts do not provide a real ""biography"" for Jesus until you look at the Gospels. The earlier Pauline epistles imply only that he was a god, and

The biblical accounts of the trial and death of Jesus are logically self-contradictory and legally impossible. Jesus could not have been executed under either Roman or Jewish law for what he did. Whatever you call what he did, it was not a capital offense under either system. Rather, it looks like someone is trying to make Old Testament prophecies of the death of the Messiah come true by fabricating a scenario which simply doesn't make sense legally.

There is no contemporaneous evidence of a historic Jesus. The only one that ever existed before was a mention of him in the Josephus Records. However, it was found that the part that mentioned him was forged and added on by early Christian scholars.

With that gone it adds up to the fact that there is no evidence he actually existed.

This video is also fantastic as well. Probably more amusing.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvleOBYTrDE""

Here is his response to the matter.

""Okay I checked out your links TheTreeMan and they were pretty good. I understand you won't give any credit to the New Testament or the gospels as being remotely historical so I won't bother to argue that in particular (though there is a lot to be said on it though). However the entire premise of your article relies upon the notion that the gospels were not contemporary and were written around the 2nd century. This notion has in fact been heavily challenged in recent scholarship and now many experts in manuscript dating agree that Matthew was written at least before 60 CE. Much earlier than previously believed. Also philologists who pay attention to dialects, expressions, idioms, etc in language have been proven very accurate in modern times. Experts in some of the latest philological research have dated all four of the Gospels somewhere between 40 and 50 CE. This would suggest that previous conceptions that date the gospels much later than Jesus were incorrect and that they may have been written only a decade or so after his death; a far cry from the 30-70 years as is regularly believed. In my opinion the dates of the writing is at the very least an open question but can be argued as being quite earlier than originally thought.Still, I anticipate that this would do absolutely nothing to lend credibility to the Gospels in your mind. 

So I'll answer the articles speculation that ""They would have noticed"" a preacher like Jesus. There is very good criticism of secular references and that's all well and good (I could go over each and offer commentary but i'll lend you the bulk of those arguments). I would offer one objection I think he overlooked. In some ways it falls into 'Jesus was a minor figure' category but I didn't see him address this point particularly. 

During this period of Jewish history there was literally constant and significant unrest in Judea between 6 CE and the eventual huge revolt in 66 CE. It is very compelling to look at the various violent upsurges and common messianic preachers who were present during this period because it provides an important context to compare Jesus' career and likeness with. I would argue that Roman/secular writers were much more concerned with various violent revolt starters who threatened not only Jewish authorities but more importantly the Roman control of the volatile territory. The article's author tries to present a situation where Jesus would have been the 'Beatles' of his day bc the gospels seem to elaborate this. Not only is this ridiculous because communications and any possible 'pop' culture of the ancient world can't be compared to modern times, the political climate was 'anti-messianic-preacher' and anti jewish dissention (hardly the glorification of Ed Sullivan Show). But most important, Jesus would have operated in a climate of multiple 'impostors', if you will, who all preached a more violent and explosive message more prone to being noticed. It is very feasible for him to be overshadowed and of very little contemporary interest outside of his limited sphere of apostles.

Now I wanna touch on the ideas that crucifixion couldn't have been a punishment and also that later Christians had to have fabricated everything. As a result of all these violent revolting messianic preachers that characterized Jesus' time there was massive fear within the authorities. It is not enough to simply claim that the letter of the Roman or Jewish law precluded Jesus from being crucified. Again, context is important; the same punishment was enacted for many of those messianic dissidents. There was even a situation where a governor crucified 2000 jewish dissenters in a fell swoop. But it wasn't only mass situations; specific individuals who seem similar to Jesus (but with a violent message) were executed in that way. It's bogus to think that during those volatile times the authorities would really care about the letter of the law. It follows that because Jesus' career (note that it was ONLY 3 years long) was in the heat of all this that he would be part of the trend and executed similarly.

A final reason that he wouldn't have been any more well known than the many other messianic preachers is that his message was curiously different and frankly less appealing, at least at first glance. The popular hope at the time was that the messiah earthly King would come and reinstate something like the Kingdom of David, a terrestrial power to save the Jews. This was the common theme of all those violent messianic revolters. Jesus' unique message of non-violence is rather bland for the general opinion and nothing of note or even feasibly understandable for contemporaries. Which brings me to question the notion that everything must have been fabricated by the church fathers. As the popular hope at the time around 6CE-66CE was for a terrestrial messiah who would establish himself as king and lead the Jews to earthly power, it is completely counterintuitive to speculate that a group of people would go against the grain and try to impose a message of non-violence, acceptance of gentiles, etc just out of the blue.

Again I dont expect to change your opinion on the matter. These are just a few things to note.""",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_g9dmk,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/g9dmk/how_would_you_respond_to_this_in_an_argument/,

*Team black*: atheists who reject God, no matter His existence.  Like Sartre said somewhere, if God did exist, it would still be necessary to refuse Him. 



Personally, if the Christian God would be proven to exist, I will not become a Christian unquestionably, or in case of Allah, become Muslim instantly, &amp;c. There is much more to a religion than the mere existence of its deities. If Loki exists, he’d still be an asshole (a wonderful and funny asshole, but still) and I would have little inclination to become his blind follower. A frequently mentioned incentive for belief is reward or punishment after death.  If a terrorist would force me against my will, threatening with hellish torture in case I refuse, this still doesn’t make me accept his morals. Conversely, the bribery of heaven is equally dishonourable and I would “most respectfully return Him the ticket.”


This argument works both ways, however. Why would a religious person carry the burden of proof or even be bothered by it? I’m trying to avoid the justification “it wouldn’t be faith if it’s proven”, my point is rather that proof of the (non-)existence of the deity of any particular religion adds little to none.

Don't mix this up with ""absolute"" morality, where a moral value holds no matter what the context (like Spock's refusal to lie even when it might be moral to do so).

**Premise #1**: *If God does not exist, objective moral values do not exist*

Many atheists seem to be in agreement with this. Richard Dawkins: *""The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no good, nothing but blind pitiless indifference.""*

If naturalism is true, and the universe consists of nothing but particles, energy, and forces, then how indeed could morality exist ""out there"", independently of humans?

**Premise #2**: *Objective moral values exist*

In our collective moral experience, we do perceive objective morality. A few things support this:

*Moral disagreement*: in, say, the abortion debate, the two sides debate over whether abortion is right or wrong. But if morality is relative and thus ""abortion is wrong"" boils down to ""I don't like abortion"", then what are they disagreeing over? You can't fight over whether ""I like chocolate ice cream"" is right or wrong because an opinion isn't *capable* of being right or wrong.

*Moral reformers*: If morality is subjective, then morality cannot improve over time as it's all just an opinion in your head. But moral history displays a sense of imrpovement: slavery abolished, segregation abolished, racism against Jews fading, homosexuals gaining more rights, etc. This bespeaks to a sort-of ""discovery"" of a moral world, in the same way we are slowly discovering the physical world.

*Human rights*: If morality is subjective, then there are no inalienable human rights. But most of us agree that there *are* inalienable human rights.

**Conclusion**: *Therefore, God exists*

**Evolution**: Appeal to evolution does not answer the question of objective morality. If I want to know whether the external world is real, I would not answer: ""Well, it isn't, because our eyes evolved."" Our moral sense evolved also, but the question is whether morality exists ""out there"", objectively, independently of people.

**Euthyphro**: A false dilemma. If God commands something because it is good, then morality M &gt; God G. If something is good because God commands it, then G &gt; M. However, the third option is G = M. God *is* the Objective Good recognized by Plato.

1369963596.0,7,self.DebateAnAtheist,1fdk9e,"After a few months of re-evaluating my religious leanings, I’m finally willing to intellectually accept the label of theist. Open to discussion/debate.",simism66,29,22,239,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1fdk9e/after_a_few_months_of_reevaluating_my_religious/,"Some Backstory (skip two paragraphs if you want):

I was raised in a Catholic family, but became atheist in my early teens.  I continued my Catholic education until I was confirmed at 16, since it was very important to my religious extended family (particularly my grandma) that I get confirmed.  In college I re-connected with religious faith, after taking some religion classes, learning about more mystical and existential understandings of religion, and reading people like Kierkegaard, Buber, and Tillich.  Looking at the world in this light gave me a perspective that I hadn’t fathomed before, and, though I didn’t accept many specifics of the ideology, I ended up re-connecting with the faith I had grown up with. 

However, a year overseas at a different academic institution changed things.  Being away from home and apart from religious people in general, not attending service regularly, and facing a (perhaps justified) pressure to conform the general patterns of thought in academia, my faith sort of faded out.  I still identified as a Christian, but the central role it played in my understanding of things dissipated.  I began to wonder what the label even meant, and I questioned the intellectual integrity of it.  A few months ago, after seeing Daniel Dennett, one of my personal heroes, speak about religion and the work he was doing helping preachers and ministers who have lost faith and sympathizing deeply with the cause, I felt like calling myself a theist was no longer intellectually honest.  Identifying as an atheist felt quite strange at first, and when I returned home it felt like a part of me was lacking.  Still, given that the only God I could coherently justify believing in was so far from the traditional conception, I felt like there was simply no way I could truly say that I believed in God. 
	
At this point, since I generally think convergence of thought is a good thing, I went as far as thinking of myself as a gnostic atheist, and I [brought it up here]( http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/1drxva/since_fallibilism_is_standard_in_epistemology_why/).  But repeated fundamental disagreement with virtually *all* (non-academic-philosopher) atheists on issues other than basic empirical and epistemic ones (issues on ontology, existential-type issues, and ethical issues) led me to question this alignment.  My general outlook on the nature of reality, life, and morality, was radically different from any atheists I spoke to, and the people with whom I connected the deepest on these levels (once again, outside of professional philosophers) have been theists (liberal-leaning theists, no doubt, but theists nonetheless).  
	
Of course, it may seem that it would just be wishful thinking if I thought that agreement on ontological, existential, and ethical matters would alter the justification regarding the way the world *really was* (whether the sort of God that most Christians believed in actually existed).  However, I think that empirical, epistemological, existential, and ethical truths are all connected in justificatory relations.  For example, I think that ethical considerations can feed into the way we understand ourselves, this understanding of ourselves affects the way we collectively understand the world around us, and we cannot easily disassociate the way we understand the world around us from what’s *really out there*.  Alongside pragmatists like Richard Rorty, I reject a [natural kinds ontology]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_kind).  Such an ontology says that there are certain groupings of the world that are completely *natural,* apart from our particular location in the world, and our practical and empirical needs.  I tend to agree with Richard Rorty, when he says, 
&gt;The line between a giraffe and the surrounding air at and the surrounding air is clear enough if you are a human being interested in hunting for meat.  If you are a language-using ant, or amoeba, or a space voyager observing us from far above, that line is not so clear, and it is not clear that you would need or have a word for ‘giraffe’ in your language.

I’d extend the pragmatist line of thought that we get (sometimes a bit sloppily) in Rorty to existential and ethical needs, in addition to practical and empirical needs.  When we realize, that “God,” unlike “giraffe” isn’t simply an empirical concept like “giraffe,” but an existential and ethical one as well, we can see why the analogy isn’t exact, but the same sort of logic carries over.

There’s a lot more I could say (particularly in explaining how the properties of God make sense), but I’ll leave it here for now, considering that I’ve said quite a bit, and respond to any questions anyone might have.  There are no quick and easy straightforward arguments for God, and I obviously don’t expect to convert any atheists here, but perhaps I might be able give some credence to the idea that some forms of theism aren’t as absurd as it might be thought at face value.  As I said, I generally think convergence in thought (especially on an issue as big as this) is a good thing, and I’m hoping we can find some productive common ground.  

EDIT: Sorry if I'm slow to respond, and sorry if what I say at times sounds wishy washy.  I am coming from a mystical tradition of thought, and, though I'm trying to elaborate as much as I can, some stuff might come off as fluff.

Prayer works for people, it gives them hope. It doesn't work for us because we believe it to be nonsense. But if it helps someone cope with the stress of being a conscious being in a crazy universe that they'd rather not understand (or in this case, gives them hope that their family will be safe from harm), why tell them it doesn't?


Why try to tell people the way they are living is a waste if it's not a waste from their perspective. Why tell them their happiness is false?


I understand that religion makes some do foul things, but to criticize the religious as a whole for a few is wrong to me. Especially in a time of tragedy, why are we criticizing these people for their beliefs? It's not painting a picture of atheism that I want seen by the rest of the world. I want all humans, regardless of faith, to live in harmony.


Carl Sagan talked about religion and science being an alliance in his book Billions and Billions, he wanted us to come together and put our differences aside to try and spread the word that we are ruining our world with pollution. It's something I admire about him, that he was willing to try to bring our species closer together.


But It's shit like this in the picture that makes me sick to my stomach. How we have to be so intolerant about each others beliefs right after a horrific tragedy and loss of human life.


It needs to stop before it gets worse. Or am I completely wrong on this?

I'm currently still in high school, and one day a long time ago I looked around at my Christian based family and world around me and told myself that it was necessary that I discard everything I believe just because someone told me it was true. From that point on I have been constantly constructing a new belief system for myself. Now I would describe myself in these ways (which after having looked around for something to call myself I've come up loosely with being ""pantheism""):

* I feel that science can explain everything, and that the mystical elements of life are just a consequence of our tiny human brains trying to comprehend it all.

* Despite this I find myself in awe of the great beauty and emotion in nature and generally just all the happenings of ""existence"" as we know it. A quote by Einstein that comes to mind goes something like: ""There are two ways to live your life. One as though nothing is a miracle. The as though everything is a miracle.""

* I've thought to myself: what if there was ever nothing? Like not even a void? Why is there even something at all? This is when I try to discern meaning for my own existence in this great infinitely complex cosmic tapestry. A quote from the song In the Aeroplane Over the Sea kinda describes what I'm getting at: ""Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all...""


The reason that I ask this question (and I'm very new to reddit) is because I'm just as fed up with annoying narrow minded atheists as I am with annoying narrow minded Christians. I observe a constant bickering between the two sides when I really think it would be so wonderful for people to appreciate the beauty of science as a divine thing in itself.

I don't know anything about physics.  So recently I started learning.  I started learning about Einstein's theory of general relativity and suddenly I am seeing that time is not as static as I always thought.  In fact it seems a lot of weird things really go on.

I did not realize that this concept of a universe that had just always ""been here"" is kind of an old world way of thinking of things.  Instead if I understand things, the universe really did have a beginning and is now slowly expanding.

Note that I am not stating the title as fact; rather just a postulate.

If you've read much philosophy, you might have read about the ""logical positivists"", a group formed in the 30s (and disbanded soon after).  To put in a nutshell, their theory was that all science came down to physics (even chemistry and biology) and that to consider anything else science was incorrect.  Furthermore, they wouldn't accept any claims made by non science (psychological, philosophical, etc).  Yes, there were plenty of problems in their theory; but I'm getting there.

So the popular burden of proof argument is as follows; one who theorizes the existence of a god must provide empirical proof for its existence.  The problem behind this is that the existence of such gods cannot be proven by science (despite what some groups might say), and therefore cannot be examined scientifically.  We can't examine art or poetry or philosophy scientifically; in many cases, these are very inexact, subjective subjects.  Religion is in the same category.

I mention the logical positivists because the burden of proof argument is one that, while not exactly following their views, follows closely (and probably better follows the views of the more moderate child logical empiricism).

One caveat to this; this holds EXCEPT when religions make scientific claims, in which case absolutely, give us proof.

There are far more problems with religion, a deity's existence, and the like outside the burden of proof; this was by no means an argument that persuaded me to change my views.

I think science gives us no bearing on whether we should believe the supernatural. Science does not say there is evidence for or against the supernatural, because science only tests the natural. What I feel many atheists are trying to argue is that because the supernatural has no evidence, then it is impossible. For example, if scientists observe one trillion potatoes, and none of them turn into diamonds spontaneously, then scientists can only conclude that potatoes don't spontaneously turn into diamonds naturally (or at least there is a close to 0 probability of spontaneous diamond formation). It doesn't say that potatoes can't turn into diamonds through a supernatural force. In fact, I think that it can't determine the probability of the existence of a supernatural force that can turn a potato into a diamond. And if science can't tell us about the existence of the supernatural, then science can't tell us about the existence of a God. So coming from a scientific standpoint, wouldn't the belief or unbelief of a supernatural being be completely faith based?

This argument is currently plaguing me from way back when I went to parochial school. During our science class we watched a video that presented the following argument (direct quote here, as I have the VHS):

""Modern scientists believe that the universe came about by the Big Bang - an explosion which caused the expansion of the universe and for all life to exist. This idea has a major flaw. Never before have scientists or anyone else witnessed order come from disorder. It would be similar to exploding a Cadillac and getting a Mercedes, or punching through a window and getting a Sworovski. The probability of this happening would be astronomical - any rational person would call it downright impossible. It hasn't happened, not now, and never in the past. So, let's use Occam's Razor here for a second. Which sounds simpler, that order came from disorder, or that an intelligent designer created the universe? The answer is as obvious as it is simple.""

Perhaps this is *Argument from Complexity Mach II*, but I could still use some help with this argument. 

Thank you.

* The universe is an open system, not a closed system used in the laws of thermodynamics. Also see [A Universe From Nothing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo) and [Talk Origins](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/thermo.html).
* There are many examples of order coming from disorder: Snowflakes, tornados, photosynthesis, etc. See [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0&amp;feature=youtu.be) for further discussion.
* The Occam's Razor argument falls flat. Order from Disorder is one possibility, whereas an intelligent designer plus order from disorder are two possibilities. Order from Disorder has fewer possibilities and therefore is simpler than an intelligent designer.
* The final proposition that an intelligent designer ordered the universe is an [Argument from Ignorance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance). The conclusion appears randomly in the argument without any supporting premises.
* The argument presented here is a reformulation of [Hoyle's Fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoyle\'s_fallacy).

1326307181.0,7,self.DebateAnAtheist,ocnud,Can we discuss G.K. Chesterton?,outisemoigonoma,17,10,99,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/ocnud/can_we_discuss_gk_chesterton/,"To preface, Chesterton was raised in an atheistic  environment, so he was intimately familiar with the atheism he dismissed. He was a rebel who even rebelled against rebellion itself and tried to form a new heresy, only to find out that someone has beat him to it, 2000 years ago. For those who haven’t read him, something I wholeheartedly recommend, I’ll give a broad sketch of what I regard as his most important contribution, based on some quotes from his book ‘Orthodoxy’.

Scientific materialism, the thesis that only matter exists and science is the only way to explain it, is suspicious to Chesterton. Materialists, like madman, are a little too sure of themselves. After all, 
&gt;the madman's explanation of a thing is always complete, and often in a purely rational sense satisfactory. 

Science may be peer reviewed, but this is done within the same materialistic frame of thought. This is almost cheating, for it makes science immune from non-scientific critique. It is a sort of self-righteous hypocrisy, reaffirming its own method like a student grading his own work. If science is true, it has to be determined externally, not from *within* science. Chesterton needs an exception to justify the rule: a miracle.
&gt; The believers in miracles accept them (rightly or wrongly) because they have evidence for them. The disbelievers in miracles deny them (rightly or wrongly) because they have a doctrine against them.

In science, miracles are excluded, for it is based on repeatable experiments. This presumption is a shortcoming, according to Chesterton. 
&gt; The morbid logician seeks to make everything lucid, and succeeds in making everything mysterious. The mystic allows one thing to be mysterious, and everything else becomes lucid.

The exception is the prime miracle in Christianity: the Resurrection of Christ. The miracle saves science from circularly proving itself and reason from self-destruction.
&gt;Reason is itself a matter of faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. […] The young sceptic says, ""I have a right to think for myself."" But the old sceptic, the complete sceptic, says, ""I have no right to think for myself. I have no right to think at all."" […] There is a thought that stops thought. That is the only thought that ought to be stopped. That is the ultimate evil against which all religious authority was aimed.

According to Chesterton, the basis for atheism, scientific materialism, is deeply flawed and only one religion is more reasonable. 
&gt;*Let the atheists themselves choose a god. They will find only one divinity who ever uttered their isolation; only one religion in which God seemed for an instant to be an atheist.*
 
In fact, Nietzsche’s infamous phrase “God is dead” is part of the Apostle’s Creed and is commemorated on Good Saturday: the period when the Lord Jesus Christ was actually dead until his resurrection on Easter Sunday. Furthermore, the label of atheist was originally attributed to Christians in the Roman Empire.  Paradoxically, atheism leads one to Christianity, but Chesterton is not afraid to acknowledge paradoxes; he loves them. Paradoxes in itself are not wrong, they are no less absurd than reality. So yes, Christianity is a paradox, but a better one than atheism, which is self-defeating. 

I could continue enumerating arguments for Christianity, but Let me leave you this last quote. 
Chesterton believes 
&gt;for the same reason that an intelligent agnostic disbelieves in Christianity. I believe in it quite rationally upon the evidence. But the evidence in my case, as in that of the intelligent agnostic, is not really in this or that alleged demonstration; it is in an enormous accumulation of small but unanimous facts.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_ocnud,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/ocnud/can_we_discuss_gk_chesterton/,

My question to kick this off is as follows and should only be answered by atheists: ""Do you personally believe in disposing of the dead body of someone you loved in a manner considered respectful to you (so long as they themselves did not specify a method), or is it better to dispose of them in the most sanitary, inexpensive way possible?""

Follow-up questions are these: ""If yes, then why?"" and ""If no, then what is the most morally acceptable means of disposing of a dead body and why do you think this?""  

EDIT: There basically seem to be two camps of atheist out there:

1. I would bury the stranger according to the cheapest, most efficient way possible. I also have no problem with what is done to dead bodies.

2. I would bury the stranger according to a traditional method of burial that I find acceptable. I also have no problem using dead bodies as food or tools under dire circumstances, but find most other uses objectionable.

&gt;Generally, folks of the second type believe in a kind of ""scientism"", that all valid or rational questions are empirically answerable. This is an extremely primitive philosophy, and discloses an disinterest in learning anything about serious philosophy. Also, their arguments against theism are often very primitive - a person who studies and understands philosophy can still be atheist (I figure most are) but generally with more respect, as religious thinkers were not nearly as dumb as most Dawkinsist folks think, one should think about an Aquinas or Lewis or other theistic thinkers as a ""worthy foe"", whose ideas take considerable brow-sweat to reject, not bumbling fools who just can be laughed off because they believe in some tooth fairy. I mean when you study philosophy and learn that a thinker as sophisticated and btw the founder of existentialis as Kierkegaard was a Christian or people like Leibniz or Kurt Gödel believed in the ontological proof, then it is clearly not as a simple laughing matter as the average Dawkinsist thinks, but requires considerable consideration before one rejects it. On the whole, Dawkinsists not only disrespect religion but also philosophy, and do it in a way that discloses that they don't even know what they are talking about, as if it was not worth learning about, and IMHO this is it.

As such, Pantheism denotes the idea that ""God"" is best seen as a process of relating to the Universe. Although there are divergences within Pantheism, the central ideas found in almost all versions are the Cosmos as an all-encompassing unity and the sacredness of Nature.

Pandeism or Pan-Deism, is a term describing beliefs incorporating or mixing logically reconcilable elements of pantheism (that ""God"", or its metaphysical equivalent, is identical to the Universe) and deism (that the creator-god who designed the Universe no longer exists in a status where it can be reached, and can instead be confirmed only by reason).

It does *not* infer the crusades were misguided or that they were not real Christians. Having said that, here's my attempt at putting together the gist of what Cavanaugh's writings argue.
&gt;* 
Cavanaugh’s thesis is twofold: (1) there is no such thing as transhistorical and transcultural religion, inherently inward and private, and thus separated from politics, and so what qualifies as religion in a given context is contingent upon different configurations of power; and (2) the attempt to assert such a transhistorical and transcultural “religion” separate from the “secular” is itself part of a particular configuration of power, that being the modern liberal nation-state.


&gt;* 
He argues that each scholar in question has artificially and inconsistently attended to “religious” violence over “secular” and has subscribed to the prevailing understanding that “religious” violence is inherently more absolutist, divisive, and irrational than “secular” violence. Such a distinction—firmly anchored in an understanding of religion as timeless and universal—is neither examined nor justified, and it ignores other prominent scholarship recognizing that things like secular nationalism can be characterized as religious.

&gt;* 
What happened in early modern Europe was not a separation of dangerously irrational religion from commendably rational and secular politics, but rather “the substitution of the religion of the state for the religion of the church.

&gt;* 
The scholars who proffer the myth of religious violence think that “religion” refers to something transhistorically and transculturally shared and separable from politics, social relationships, and economic exchanges, unaware that the secular / religious distinction employed is itself an invention of Western modernity, an ideological corollary of the construction of the liberal nation-state and modern Western colonialism.

&gt;* 
There is no reason to suppose that so-called secular ideologies such as nationalism, patriotism, capitalism, Marxism, and liberalism are any less prone to be absolutist, divisive, and irrational than belief in, for example, the biblical God

It seems to me London (not so political/economic as we'd suspect) and many other parts of history and the world put the lie to such a thought.  In the original case... its clear the world uses religion for identity when it uses it at all.  It therefore becomes Religion-Nationalism, Religion-Racism, Religion-Classism and  all kinds of other torrid emotional orgies.  Almost always core of the religion (among the biggest ones) do not support this... but has a set of morals that deny it.  Over time usually the core of the religion, if it survives, becomes obviously in conflict and the abuses must relent or find another justification.

What would happen if all those base passions were based on Atheism-cum-Politicalized identities?  (Its happened before).  Would there be a ""return to core Atheism"" that would teach real ethics?  It doesn't seem so because that question is punted over and over and over and over.

It has always seemed to me that merely ""removing"" Religion is a frightfully ignorant way to ""free Humanity"" from motivations based on superstition and fear.  Instead it seems a comprehensive morality *IS* needed.... one that is *VERY* in depth and *DEVOTED* without simple self-oriented logic.  With God or not... some fear of wrongdoing must exist in all of us from youth until the age of yob-hood.

I've heard over and over that rejecting religion would save us into Utopia.  Isn't there more than enough evidence that a real ""Humanism"" (not merely crypto-""scientific"" Materialism) needs far clearer ethical frameworks, even ones that look like secularized Judeo-Christian values?

I have used ""~~strike~~"" in the below OP so you can see where the error was made and how this changes the OP.  I apologize for my sloppiness.  Luckily we got some good discussions going that should not be too terribly affected!  :D**


I originally posted this argument in r/atheism, and got some pretty thoughtful comments, but no resolution to the actual problem presented.  Hoping for some new insights!

Here is the argument I presented:

&gt;An interesting thought experiment:

&gt;According to our community FAQ, atheism is most commonly defined as such:

&gt;    Atheism: the lack of belief in gods.

&gt;In line with our community FAQ, atheism is defined by wiki as such:

&gt;    Agnosticism is the view that the truth value of certain claims—especially claims about the existence or non-existence of any deity, but also other religious and metaphysical claims—is unknown or unknowable

&gt;Thus, agnosticism deals with knowledge about deities, whereas atheism deals with a lack of belief of deities.

&gt;As such, atheism and agnosticism are not mutually exclusive concepts. The first concept deals with belief in deities, the other deals with knowledge of deities. This distinction (rather helpfully) allows us to distinguish between agnostic ('weak') atheism, and gnostic ('strong') atheism. We can also use this distinction to characterize theism as being 'weak' or 'strong'.

&gt;Now here comes the curveball...

&gt;What is the difference between knowledge and belief?

&gt;Well, belief is simply ""a cognitive content held as true.""

&gt;Knowledge, on the other hand, is most commonly defined as a very special type of belief--one that is justified and true. Now here is where [Gettier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettier_problem) comes in.

&gt;In 1963 Gettier wrote a 3-page bombshell (downloadable at the wiki link) that used two counterexamples showing that a justified true belief (jtb) does not always constitute as knowledge. While these cases may at first seem rather cheesy to the casual observer, they do illustrate an intriguing problem with defining knowledge as a jtb. In attempt to solve this conundrum, philosophers have attempted to add a fourth condition (JTB+G) to knowledge, but as far as majority consensus goes, have still not managed to encapsulated the concept of knowledge. Thus, the Gettier Problem remains...

&gt;Given the Gettier Problem, how can one coherently save the distinction between belief and knowledge? Obviously, for there to be a distinction, one must be able to at least say what knowledge is.

&gt;If we cannot coherently distinguish knowledge from belief, it follows that we cannot coherently distinguish between **~~atheism and agnosticism~~** agnostic atheism and gnostic atheism.

&gt;R/atheism, how would you distinguish between belief and knowledge such that you do not run into the Gettier problem? Any thoughts?

I wound up with what I call ""Jesus Foundationalism"" by adding a single term to classical foundationalism, as follows:

A belief is justified when it is...

- Self-evident (meaning nobody could honestly and rationally contradict it);

- Evident to the senses;

- Incorrigible (in the sense of impossible to dispute, like ""I am happy"");

- Specifically uttered by Jesus Christ;

- Or derived by deductive reason from one or more of the above beliefs.


It is important to note that the Bible is not given special treatment here. It is a work of literature and ancient history, similar to other such works. It is in no way inerrant or divinely inspired; the belief here is that Jesus *himself* was inerrant in his *actual* utterances, which are now unfortunately lost to us. The challenge is to use our best scholarship to determine what we are confident he *actually* said.

As it turns out, a group called the [Jesus Seminar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Seminar) has done a lot of work in this area. They have compiled a list of alleged sayings of Jesus from the four canonical gospels plus the Gospel of Thomas and the known portions of Q, and have used a deliberative process to rate each one on its probability of having actually been uttered by Jesus. There are many criticisms (and defenses) of their methodology, but for the purposes of my thought experiment, I'm going to rely on them. (They may not have done the best possible job, but they have surely done a better job than I'm likely to do on my own this evening.)

Since I don't intend to spend weeks on this, I only looked at the 15 utterances in the topmost ""red"" category, which the Jesus Seminar is collectively very certain are authentic utterances of Jesus. By my reading, these fall into four easily definable groups, as follows:

**Morals**

- Love your enemies; do good to those who hate you.

- If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also.

- If someone takes your shirt, also give them your coat.

- If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles.

- Give to anyone who asks of you, and if someone takes something from you, do not demand it back.

- Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.

My summary: Do good until it hurts. Then do good some more. This is *not* the Golden Rule or the Wiccan Rede. He doesn't talk about what *you* want at all. You are instructed to maximize the good you do for others, full stop, that's all she wrote.

**Beatitudes**

- Blessed are the poor, for they shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.

- Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled.

- Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.

My summary: In each case the normal idea of what comes next is reversed. So in the aggregate, I think the idea is to make you question your assumptions. Each of them also contains the assurance that perseverance will be rewarded and that your difficulties and troubles are temporary.

**Parables**

- The parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:30-35)

- The parable of the shrewd manager (Luke 16:1-8a)

- The parable of the vinyard laborers (Matthew 20:1-15)

My summary: Like the beatitudes, these stories each contain a striking reversal. The person helpful to strangers is of a persecuted race; the manager is rewarded rather than punished; the laborers are told to suck it up even though their sense of being cheated seems legitimate. None of these are easy to understand or interpret. Like the beatitudes, the parables force you to question your assumptions. Jesus does not provide simple answers and forces you to struggle for understanding, which I think is the point. 

**Metaphysics**

- Our father in heaven (""Abba, father"")

- The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman mixed into about sixty pounds of flour until it worked all through the dough.

- The mustard seed (Mark 4:30-32)

My summary: God exists, has a fatherly relationship with us (where ""us"" includes Jesus), and inhabits the ""Kingdom of Heaven."" The Kingdom of Heaven is like a tiny seed or grain of yeast, which nevertheless grows into something greatly powerful. Also, it is in some way mixed into the fabric of the world around us.


Okay, so where does this leave us with Jesus Foundationalism?

**Question 1: Is it consistent?**

I think the answer is yes. There is nothing in these utterances of Jesus which contradicts physical reality or interferes in any way with scientific materialism. The Beatitudes could possibly be understood as a physical claim of future events, and the objection could be raised that throughout history, people who mourn have routinely died before finding comfort. But ""inherit the kingdom of heaven"" is not a materialist claim, so it's reasonable to suppose that none of the Beatitudes are intended as materialist claims.

I'm not sure if this solves the problem of classical foundationalism being self-refuting. The question is: If beliefs are justified *only* through Jesus Foundationalism, then is belief in JF justified? I don't think we have proof that it is, but unlike CF, with JF we don't know that it isn't, either. It is possible that JF could be constructed from the *actual* utterances of Jesus, if only we had a record of all of them. You can't *show* JF to be self-refuting, as you can with CF.

**Question 2: Is it Christianity?**

Most elements of modern Christianity are missing. There is no original sin, no sacrifice, no redemption of the world, no requirement to claim salvation in the name of Jesus, no claim that Jesus is the only path to salvation, and no notion that God has a plan for each of us or that God directly or immediately answers prayer. However, it *does* include the idea that God exists, Heaven exists, and that our troubles will be lifted. The parable of the vinyard laborers could also be understood to suggest that every laborer will earn the promised reward, even if they begin their labors late in the day, which is similar to the promise of modern Christianity.

**Question 3: Is it moral?**

It lacks many of the moral difficulties of modern fundamentalist/evangelical Christianity. The God of Israelite genocide is entirely absent. The notion that God demands belief and obedience is entirely absent. What is demanded of a Christian is *much more onerous* than any of this: Christians must dedicate themselves *entirely* to doing good for other people. It's hard to see how any claim could be sustained that this is an immoral act. Of course it means that practically nobody calling themselves Christian is actually Christian. But most Christian sects already make this claim, for various reasons.

**Question 4: Is it acceptable to skeptics/atheists?**

Skeptics and atheists will of course not believe JF. But followers of modern Christianity are unacceptable to skeptics/atheists not because they believe what they believe, but because they insist on passing laws and creating social structures that force specific dogma on to non-believers (for example, teaching young earth creationism as if it were science). None of this appears in JF. I don't see any reason why a JF-adherent ought to be unpalatable to a skeptic as a co-worker or a person whose home you would visit or whose beliefs you would discuss rationally.

**Conclusion**

While I don't believe it myself (since I personally lack belief in God), I don't think I would have strong objections if someone else wanted to believe JF. I don't think it would be inconsistent with science or rationality. I also think it would have a strong logical foundation, much better than the usual unsupportable assertions of Biblical inerrancy. I'm curious what Christians and atheists think of it.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_erv2r,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/erv2r/jesus_foundationalism/,

",ghjm,8,1,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/eqc2d/does_morality_arise_from_evolution_or_despite/,"According to evolutionary psychology, human consciousness arises from a complex interaction of chemical and electrical activity in the brain. Our brains are wired to reward certain behaviors and suppress others. Successful reward systems (such as sex being pleasurable, toxins tasting bad, etc) exist the way they do because if they had existed some other way, our species would not have survived.

But humans, as the only currently living animals with sufficient mental powers to understand evolution, are not bound to follow the dictates of these reward systems. The fact that a trait has evolved does not mean it is desirable, good, moral or even that it *remains* fit for its environment. There are many reward systems in humans that we see as detrimental and struggle against, such as the desire to eat more sugary foods than are good for us. So the mere fact that the brain is wired to reward something means absolutely nothing about its actual desirability or ""goodness.""

So it seems that some evolved behaviors are good, but other behaviors with equal evolutionary histories are bad. The criteria for ""goodness"" or ""badness"" must therefore arise outside of the evolutionary mechanics themselves.

Can it arise from ""success?""  Surely not, since we have plentiful examples of successful behaviors which are nevertheless immoral. The (presumably evolved) ability to take or become slaves has been *successful* for societies throughout human history. But nobody in their right mind would call it moral.

Can it arise from ""happiness?""  Surely not, since we have the (presumably evolved) capability of shutting out information related to our own immorality when it conflicts with our happiness. Americans live an energy- and resource-rich lifestyle which makes them happy, at tremendous cost visible only in the third world. Happiness maximization is generally understood to be the opposite of living a moral life. Sacrificing your own happiness to help distant strangers is clearly *more moral* than refusing, even if the great reduction in your own happiness more than offsets the corresponding minor increases in the strangers' happiness. 

So where does it come from?

In my conversations with other Christians about this, one of the biggest reasons that I have been given as to the authenticity of Christ is supernatural events happening on earth. I have friends who have claimed to have healed people of blindness and other ailments in Africa and another who has claimed to have been visited by Jesus in a dream. The dream wouldn't be so fantastic or worthy of note except that the next day, one of his friends asked him specifically about things that Jesus had supposedly told him (without any provocation from my friend). His friend even told him that he had prayed that people would receive visions or dreams about it.
Another reason is the conversion of Muslims to Christianity through visions of Christ. I have met one man who said he was visited by Christ and so converted to Christianity from Islam and I also have a family friend who is a missionary in Indonesia where he says that people come up to him without provocation and ask him about Christianity because Jesus came to them in a dream. [There is an article here that touches on it.](http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1728744/supernatural_dreams_and_visions_compel.html?cat=34) This is really what is holding me onto my belief in the supernatural because I have no other explanation. I can expound on any of these examples if you want, I would love to hear your input on these things as evidence of Christianity being the truth.

**Challenge #1**: *Self-refutation*

The proposition is self-refuting. Either it's false, or if it's true then it's false by it's own advice. 

**Challenge #2**: *Relating to the God debate*

An evidentialist objection to the existence of God can be framed like this:

1. Belief in God is rational only if there is sufficient evidence for God's existence
2. There is not sufficient evidence for the existence of God
3. Therefore, belief in God is irrational

But replace God with, say, the external world (i.e., that solipsism is false):

1. Belief in the external world is rational only if there is sufficient evidence for the external world
2. There is not sufficient evidence for the external world
3. Therefore, belief in the external world is irrational 

There is no evidence that the external world is real, and yet you probably believe that it is.

Or substitute any number of other beliefs you probably hold for which there is no evidence: that Last-Thursdayism is false (Bertrand Russell: ""there is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago, exactly as it then was, with a population that 'remembered' a wholly unreal past""), that other people experience consciousness, that the Nazis were morally wrong as opposed to morally right, etc.

Just kidding! This is a terrible argument from Christians. However, I contend that it's terrible because Christians and atheists alike misunderstand it and that the *real* argument actually provides some interesting debate topics.

The real argument is not that *belief* in God is necessary for objective morality, but that the *existence* of God is necessary for objective morality.

Objective morality is defined here as a moral value that is true regardless of whether anyone is around to think it true. I.e., even if everyone on earth believed slavery was right, slavery would still be wrong. So it would be like math. 2+2=4 objectively, even if everyone thought 2+2=5.

It goes something like this:

If naturalism is true, then there doesn't seem to be any reason why morality would be *objective*. A socio-political construct, maybe, but not *objective.*

But our moral experience does speak to a set of objective morals. We have to stop the Nazis because they are objectively wrong. If morality were relative, then we should allow the Nazis to perform the Holocaust because it's just like another opinion or a favorite flavor of ice cream. It may not be right for us, but it's right for them. 

We also seem to experience a sense of moral progress throughout history; pedophilia once acceptable in ancient Greece, slavery once acceptable, etc. If morality were truly relative, then we would have a sense that slavery might come back into fashion at some point. But many of us don't feel that way. We feel like we are witnessing the uncovering of a moral ""world"", in the same way we are slowly uncovering the physical world.

I had an interesting debate with my brother about consequentialism, and I know many of you here are also consequentialists. Now, I generally hold the belief that we're generally better off focusing on the consequences of actions/choices, and that this will result in better lives for everyone. However, my brother brought up this hypothetical. What if Hitler's ""final solution"" was in fact a final solution? What if an act like that actually did wipe out certain defects that caused suffering, and that this effect lasted for a long time? Long enough that one could easily say that the net suffering was lessened greatly.

Now, at first, I couldn't even answer because I couldn't comprehend this as a working solution to problems. I mentioned that it sets up a precedent that is bound to be repeated again and again, trying to eradicate what comes up naturally and without blame. But he wanted me to imagine a situation like this that had lasting effects. Would such a horrific act be deemed good if it created a world where there was less suffering? Could the outcome turn such an act of genocide into a morally good act?

**EDIT:**

Ok, I've come to the conclusion that the ""Final Solution"" and Hitler muddies the conversation (thank you, rlee89), so I'd like to use a simplified version. Let's look at this simplified and alternate setup for the ""final solution"". Two races of people live together. Race A hates race B purely for being different, as they place a higher value on their cultural behaviors, teachings, etc... A and B both suffer due to this, since A is constantly upset that B exists, and B is harmed by A being upset. So A destroys B, and then lives happily ever after.

(we observe only our own minds, but reasonably conclude the existence of others, we observe mater acting independently of us in a way that things in our mind do not)

Edit: We should explain one of these things in terms of the other, if we can.

We do not observe and can not conceive of mind emerging from matter. (I have tried very hard to even understand what that would mean, and have read Godel Escher Bach and it is still completely impossible to conceive of, or to conceive of someone else conceiving of.)

Edit: No amount of neuroscience can explain what ""I"" am. That is, it can not explain how Mind emerges from matter. (If we knew the function of every neuron and every flash between them perfectly so that we could read a persons exact thoughts as they thought them and so that we could re-write every detail of their personality, how would that explain how there is a mind experiencing all those things? It would explain perfectly my experiences of other people's behaviors but not my experience of being a person myself, even if i could do it to myself.)

We can easily conceive of both matter and mind emerging from mind. (I argue that this happens every time we imagine something, it is real, we can interact with it and make true and false statements about it, fictional characters that we imagine ""take on a life of their own,"" they perceive the world and act in ways that are theirs not ours)

Edit: The above in more detail:

---a simulated mind is a real mind
(if you believe that mind can emerge from mater you ought to be able to grant this)

---minds can simulate other minds and mater
(I can? can't you? every time you make up a fictional charecter, an imaginary friend, or try to decide if your wife will like an idea)

---to a simulated mind simulated mater is real

---thus real mater and real minds can emerge from a mind


Thus it is more reasonable to suppose that we and our world emerged from a Mind than it is to suppose that we (as minds) emerged from the matter of our world.

Anything created by a mind is less real than that mind (a fictional character is less real than the person that is imagining him but far more real than the-charecter-no-one-ever-imagined; the first difference in real-ness is far less significant than the second)

If we and our world emerged from a Mind, then that Mind is more real than we are. (same as above said another way)

Someone more real than us and able to imagine us ought to be called God.

A summery of my argument: a mind can simulate matter and other minds so it makes more sense to explain mater as mind then to explain mind as mater. A mind that is simulating us and our world would be God.

&gt; It’s science and sciencing (I'm coining that!) that got me here, honestly. Asking questions and seeking knowledge; holding up the mantle of the skeptic and critical thinker.  But where I live, which could honestly be anywhere- questioning religion(s), God(s), or personal belief(s) is the one place you don’t go. You just don’t. 

&gt; It is the literal definition of taboo. 

&gt; You can’t question someone’s faith without attacking it. Criticizing the existence of Santa Claus or leprechauns is perfectly acceptable, especially for an adult (even encouraged), but disputing the existence of one Jesus Christ seems to carry a weight that can only be described as “with discretion”. Even I, in my younger years, adamantly defended the Mormon faith from what I perceived as unwarranted, arrogant attacks. I did what I could with what little I thought I knew. It typically and predictably boiled down to the ultimate trump card of ‘faith’ and tuning out that which I did not want to hear or what was too challenging to my comprehension of reality. I was completely unaware that the questions I was deflecting and labeling as disrespectful were the very same questions I would soon be asking myself and those around me. 
            
&gt; Anything that is held close, such as a particular idea or belief, is too often immune from the spectrum of consideration for validity. Most people consider it wrong and disrespectful to question their beliefs. Yet those beliefs, true or not, are typically part of a larger system of that is directly responsible for those beliefs in the first place- And that system is the practice of religion.  And religious practice, its influence, and its thick blanket of ignorance, continue to thrive, unchallenged and simply ignored as a major player in the every day lives of over half of Americans . Yes, there is a developing community of atheists making an audible influence on the internet and in more secular societies, but they are all but drowned out by the enormous outcry on behalf of theists worldwide: 

&gt; “Stone to death those infidels that would dare question our ultimate authority, God!” Or, more subtlety, ""Please don't question my personal beliefs, I'm very sensitive about them.""
            
&gt; Being atheist, that is, having no belief in any personal god, it turns out, is not so bad. It comes hand in hand with skepticism, and I have fully embraced it. Although it can be dangerous to be open about it- The opposition is fueled by hate. Hate that is bred from bigotry, bigotry that is birthed from ignorance and ignorance stemming from an alarming lack of critical thinking that can most often be traced directly to a poor education and a history of religious indoctrination.
            
&gt; All my life I've always heard: “Be the change you want to see.”  Well I want to see childhood indoctrination abolished. I want to see children be taught how to think for themselves, rather than what to think. Questioning my own beliefs is what put me on the path of education. But the path is filled with obstacles, some of them in violent opposition to the goals. One thing I realized is that while atheism has very little to do with my stance on religious practice, it is that very label that puts me at a disadvantage. The religious often fear us, thinking us evil, without morals, and closed minded. Even people that aren't religious frequently have a skewed perception of atheism. So many people have very poor exposure to atheism, resulting from the typical condescending attitude. I was a proponent of this approach for a substantial amount of time, and I wasn't alone. The majority of people see atheists as arrogant, rude, and unwarranted in their anger. Though I ask you, are we? The answer is a firm, resounding no. We witness religious practice and its influence on education, children, the treatment of women and women’s rights. We see violence every single day that is a direct result of disagreeing about God. Folks will often claim, “Well my religion isn't violent!” And while that may or may not be true, their religion is a product of the problem, and it harbors those that would commit atrocities in the name of their god. By what standards do we pick which religions are “right” and which are “wrong”? Do we cherry pick from the Holy Bible? Do we merely allow intolerance for other faiths and “blasphemy” from the notoriously violent religion of Islam? Religious practice in all forms must be considered, the root of which all contain something fundamentally wrong and backwards: That faith is a virtue. 

&gt; All children of religious parents are taught this. This is teaching children what to think. It is teaching children to be satisfied with ignorance. I now witness this broadly and first hand. It angers me, and I feel like something needs to happen. The majority of parents are instilling the fear of God in their children. It can absolutely be psychologically damaging to young and older minds alike. It is a form of abuse and simultaneously a breeding ground for ignorance, bigotry, and intolerance. Children everywhere, not just in the Bible Belt or Utah, are being blindfolded from infancy. I am writing and arguing on behalf of them. They are too young to know what’s going on. They should not be abused, psychologically, mentally, or physically. They should not be indoctrinated. They should not be subjected to guilt over the vengeful eye of the Lord. They’re children, and they've done nothing wrong. 

&gt; Human rights everywhere are infringed upon by religious dogma. Politics should be secular. The laws that affect all of us should be free of any religious influence or interest. They clearly are not. In America, the Christian Right has a far, heavy handed reach into public policies. It is considered political suicide to be atheist, as atheists are literally feared. To be in politics in the united states, you must believe in God.
 
&gt; Education standards need to be raised. Students should be taught to think for themselves and how to think critically. These kinds of classes need to be standard curriculum. Intelligent design and creationism need to be thrown out the window entirely. Sexual education should be a non-issue. 

&gt; All women everywhere should have the exact same rights as men. And if you agree to the extent that yes, the “role” of women in Islam is degrading, then perhaps you should read the bible more thoroughly. Judaism and Christianity place women below men as well. Abortion should ultimately be the decision of the woman that is pregnant. If possible, it could be a mutual decision between potential parents, but never a religion’s choice (see Texas). 

&gt; Homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. They don’t and there is a movement taking place that isn't fully placing the blame where it should fall: Squarely on the shoulders of any organized religion, religious dogma, or “holy scripture” that strictly forbids homosexuality. I want to see these things happen because as humans we are equals. We should all have the same chance at the same things, and there should be no prejudice for any of the differing attributes we may have. 
            
&gt; And if they want, yes people should be able to practice their religion, so long as it doesn't affect those incapable of deciding for themselves, or anyone else. But as it currently stands, it does affect those incapable of deciding for themselves, as well as the rest of us. If you don't believe me- Well, good. You should research it for yourself. Something a religion would never recommend.  

  

**i then received this response**  

&gt;Oh boy you awoke a novel on this one for me. Here goes......
Literally the definition of taboo? Says who? For I believe Truth is God, so to ask questions of everything is the very nature of the divine. 

&gt; But I was the young girl who even at 5 was sent to the ministers chambers for audaciously asking in Sunday school “if God is all forgiving then how can there possibly be unforgivable sins. Needn't all I do is ask?” I regularly set up the juice and cookies and was quickly handed over to my Parents. Now this continued at my best friend’s places of worship, Catholic Mass and Synagogue. I was deemed a holy terror in my town. 

&gt; My spiritualism knows no bounds and I will not constrain myself for another. My Father was a Christian, my mother and atheist. I suppose I became the battle of the two inside the freedom they allowed me to follow my own heart’s whispers. My mother says I was born knowing who I was. Perhaps she was right for it would have been impossible to indoctrinate me. They tried and so often failed. 

&gt; I relish the discourse of beliefs for I don’t fear I will be diminished by another’s light. Knowledge only enhances me. Over the years I have selected the bits that speak to the god of my own heart. Trust me I am not the norm as I have ever so many times been reminded. But I still believe Faith is a virtue.

&gt; Now I agree with you that religion is a product of the problem. But not that it is the problem. Hatred, Avarice, jealousy, and lies are not born of religious indoctrination. They live within the hearts of men of all faiths and the faithless. 

&gt; Everything you proclaim I also believe in-secular politics, sex education, the right to choose, equal rights for the sexes no matter the orientation. However you can’t remove religion from politics without removing man. The very nature of our freedom of speech allows for another to decry the very thing I detest at the top of his lungs.

**i then replied by picking her reply apart and my responses are in italics**  





&gt; (Oh boy you awoke a novel on this one for me. Here goes......
Literally the definition of taboo? Says who? )

&gt; *Me! I say that! It is I that wrote this! But I do understand what you are asking- it boils down to opinion and experience. Where I live (and in the majority of the united states), questioning the belief systems of others is a big NO- or, Taboo.* 

&gt; (For I believe Truth is God, so to ask questions of everything is the very nature of the divine. )

&gt; *Well I believe truth is just a set of parameters defining a statement or set of statements- True or False. 1 or 0. So do we just give up there? No, we just define Truth differently.* 

&gt; (But I was the young girl who even at 5 was sent to the ministers chambers for audaciously asking in Sunday school “if God is all forgiving then how can there possibly be unforgivable sins. Needn't all I do is ask?” I regularly set up the juice and cookies and was quickly handed over to my Parents. Now this continued at my best friend’s places of worship, Catholic Mass and Synagogue. I was deemed a holy terror in my town. )

&gt; *Ha! We probably had a somewhat similar childhood. At least in regards to being curious kids that asked questions. Where I live now, I’m deemed the “atheist unbeliever” by several parties- it’s a very Mormon small town where atheists are disliked more than anything else. Its not something that usually comes up, but on the occasion that it does, I am often mocked with verbal sarcasm and nonverbal judgment.*

&gt; (My spiritualism knows no bounds and I will not constrain myself for another. My Father was a Christian, my mother and atheist. I suppose I became the battle of the two inside the freedom they allowed me to follow my own heart’s whispers. My mother says I was born knowing who I was. Perhaps she was right for it would have been impossible to indoctrinate me. They tried and so often failed.) 

&gt; *I’m sorry, but I need further information- your mother was an atheist yet she tried along with your Christian father to indoctrinate you? Into what? If it were just your father, I would assume Christianity, if it were your mother, I would assume that she would be encouraging thinking for yourself and being skeptical. I’m glad that indoctrination was impossible for YOU, but it is a sad reality for countless others. You sound like you had pretty reasonable parents. How many people do you know that have fanatical fundamentalist parents? I know scores of them. Utah is leaking out the sides with kids that would be disowned by their parents for leaving the church.* 

&gt; (I relish the discourse of beliefs for I don’t fear I will be diminished by another’s light. Knowledge only enhances me. Over the years I have selected the bits that speak to the god of my own heart. Trust me I am not the norm as I have ever so many times been reminded. But I still believe Faith is a virtue.)

&gt; *You openly acknowledge that you pick the bits that speak to “god of my own heart”- I’m going to assume you mean knowledge (as you said that knowledge enhances you) and that you pick what bits you find …convenient and feel like they fit into your perception of reality. This brings up a kind of idea that goes like “if I don’t want to believe the sky is blue, I don’t have to because it doesn’t speak to me heart.” Well the sky is blue whether or not you want to believe it. And faith, that which you consider a virtue, tells you to be complacent with not knowing- to just BELIEVE something regardless of the evidence or lack of evidence. That is exactly what faith is- believing in something without having to put any intellectual integrity into it.* 

&gt; (Now I agree with you that religion is a product of the problem. But not that it is the problem. Hatred, Avarice, jealousy, and lies are not born of religious indoctrination. They live within the hearts of men of all faiths and the faithless.) 

&gt; *While religion is not the only problem our society and planet faces, it IS one of the biggest- and in so many ways. Religion has had its place and role in the evolution of humans. It has been helpful at times and served a purpose. Religion gave answers to questions long before science was able to figure them out- but that is exactly what modern science and technology and medicine has done- We have a VASTLY greater understanding the fundamental aspects of reality than at any other time in human history (spanning over 100,000 years)- We have mapped the human genome, we have launched satellites into space, we are exploring our solar system and beyond, we have an understanding of how the universe formed, when it formed, and what is going to happen to it in the future. We have an understanding of how life evolved and what humans are. We have made cell phones and computers and the internet and we have connected the entire planet through the use of social networking. Did religion do any of this? NO! for thousands of years it just proclaimed “GOD DID IT! That’s the END! NOW HAVE FAITH AND BE OBEDIENT!” while skeptics and scientists and free thinkers figured things out in the back ground. We have SCIENCE to thank for almost every single advancement that the human race has seen. And now religions are just doing the same thing still in the face of current evidence to the contrary- I know I am generalizing and lumping all religions together in what I am arguing, but I am only doing it for simplicity and because its largely the truth. You can argue “well my religion doesn’t do that” or “they aren’t a true Christian if they do or say this or that”, but there are fallacies in those lines of logic and have been debunked over and over again.*

&gt; (Everything you proclaim I also believe in-secular politics, sex education, the right to choose, equal rights for the sexes no matter the orientation.)

&gt; *good! I’m glad we are in agreement here- these are social issues that are currently hot topics and play an important role in where society will go from here.*

&gt; (However you can’t remove religion from politics without removing man. The very nature of our freedom of speech allows for another to decry the very thing I detest at the top of his lungs. )

&gt; *I’m slightly confused by what you are saying, but I’ll take a stab at it anyway- you absolutely CAN remove religion from politics without removing man. It’s easy- just don’t let your beliefs in a Man-God dictate public policies when all the people that voted for you are saying they think (as an example) that homosexual marriage should be legal. Lets say a (Christian) politician has to vote in the senate to legalize the sale of cannabis- and lets assume that 60% of his voters APPROVE the legalization of cannabis, but his CHURCH tells him that he should vote against it- if he were to disregard what his belief system and organized religion wants, and instead focus on what the voters want, he would be practicing secularism.*

&gt; (And I don’t argue that children can be indoctrinated but at some point in our lives we must become responsible for who we choose to be beyond our parents, churches, and political leaders. We all have to decide what we are willing to live for, die for and fight for, religious or not.)

&gt; *I absolutely agree with you that we must be responsible for who become as adults and who we choose as our political leaders! We DO have to decide what we are willing to live for, die for and fight for – and yes, religious or not. But children ARE indoctrinated all the time all over the place- and almost entirely thanks to the religion of the child’s parents. That’s what fundamentalist parents DO- they became who they became and they force it on their children, who so often believe it and become that very same thing. It is a sad reality and I hope to see it stopped in my lifetime.*


&gt; (For I have stood in the torrent of rage, been burned upon the stake, suffered slays of arrows, hung at high noon, dunked and stoned to death, been run over again and again but I can’t be broken for I know who I am. So I would say Faith is indeed a virtue as unique to me as my finger print that emboldens me to rise up in the face of my adversary and cry this is my heart.)

&gt; *So have we all faced our own adversities and challenges. Such is life. Faith is a virtue only insomuch as trusting the one you love not to hurt you or lie to you. But to question the faith others might have in a mighty god or book? Surely they can handle it if their faith is so powerful- for the questions I ask will only beg them to think critically before they respond.*

**person number 2**


&gt;  ""Do we merely allow intolerance for other faiths and “blasphemy” from the notoriously violent religion of Islam?""

&gt; every religion has extremists. islam is not the only one. there are irish catholic terrorists just as there are muslim ones. they're the exception. the media has embellished and exaggerated upon a few events and thus created this image for the islamic religion. muslims as a faith are not notoriously violent. in fact, if you were to get to know any average muslim, they're mostly very ambivalent as the faith teaches them to be level headed and well mannered. another interesting point: islam advocates education and research for men and women! school is very highly regarded in the religion and even in the quran it says that education and research are one of the most highly regarded attributes. 

&gt; as for women's rights: islam asks women to cover up as a manner of self respect. it regards them very highly and doesn't want any women to be looked at as a piece of meat. to cover up demands self respect from everyone around them. islam also allowed women to buy and own property, buy and own businesses and divorce their husbands at will in a time when women were degraded and scarcely allowed rights such as these. judaism and christianity happened before islam and would never allow a female these rights. the downfall is the inability to adapt to the modern environment, and that causes people to mistake an outdated form of respect as oppression. i personally don't observe the covering of my body fully because i think the human body is beautiful, but it did introduce to me what being conservative is and really gave me a basis for always keeping it classy. i will never believe that what i do or do not wear influences my ability to have faith. 

&gt; as for myself, i am not religious. i hated to have islam shoved down my throat my entire childhood. i realize now though that without going to islamic school every saturday morning i would not have an incredibly solid moral code and value system for myself even if it's not completely synonymous with that of the religion. i believe that raising children with some sense of morality and spirituality is really really important. the problem is how to accomplish that without force feeding a religion which i myself don't really observe. 

&gt; i definitely agree with much of what you've said, but hope that you learned a little about islam in the process from someone who is educated yet mostly unbiased. this write was very intriguing and fun to read! sorry for the extensive review.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdddbYILel0

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W96AJ0ChboU

**Otherguy:** Your comment assumes that all who don't believe in evolutionary theory do so by invoking a strawman. The truth about evolutionary theory is that it is only hypothesis. It has never been tested thus it has not been tested, retested and shown to be true. Until it fulfills scientific method The Theory of Evolution remains hypothesis.

**Otherguy:** It has falsely been given the honorary title of scientific theory.

**Me:** It has falsely been given the honorary title of scientific theory.

**Otherguy:** Change is not tantamount to universal common descent. You conflate two separate disciplines.

**Me:** Evolution just means change over time, that is what the word means. With careful examination of DNA sequences we can see the relation specific species have with each other, and the separation between old and new versions of the flu is exactly the same kind of separation between ancestor species with modern species but at a smaller scale. If you understand induction, abduction, and the law of parsimony then there should be no problem for you to see that evolution is more likely than anything else to explain the diversity in life. Notice it has nothing to do with abiogenesis, bigbang, etc...

Also, your claim that it hasn't been tested, and that the title theory is only honorary is incredibly incorrect. Try doing some research

It's simple common sense that DNA related features get passed on during breeding, and that the animals which breed more get more offspring. And because of the way DNA copies itself isn't perfect is how the deletion and insertion of DNA happens.

**Me:** No disrespect intended

**Otherguy:** // Evolution just means change over time, that is what the word means.//
Actually, if you're going there with it, evolution is defined as ""Change."" Time is not necessary. Change often happens in an instant. On the other hand, if you are referring to The Theory of Evolution, it is much more than just change. It is change in allele frequency within a population over generations.

But that ""evolution"" is never observed. It is only speculated because we observe changes in allele frequency that 6 day creationist agree happens. It's called variation, not universal common descent.

If you're going to try to combat my claims you'll have to do it using accurate definitions. What you did in your statement is known as the logical fallacy of equivocation. You infer two separate issues in the compound claim.

**Otherguy:** //we can see the relation specific species have with each other//
Every 6 day creationist geneticist fully expects to see genetic similarities. It only makes sense that a creator would use what works.

**Otherguy:**  // the separation between old and new versions of the flu is exactly the same kind of separation between ancestor species with modern species but at a smaller scale.//
Excellent choice of example. Just like the flu virus remains a virus, so each creature remains the same biblical kind. We never observe mutations that ultimately result in the crossing of familial taxa no matter how long we observe the changes in allele frequency. I point to Lenski's experiment. Ultimately he abandoned it in favor of the computer model because in reality he did not see his expected result. He only reached his expected result in the controlled environment of the computer model.

**Otherguy:**  //evolution is more likely than anything else to explain the diversity in life.//
Actually, from all the arguments you've offered so far, it is much more likely that everything was created after its kind just like the Bible tells us.

**Otherguy:** //Notice it has nothing to do with abiogenesis, bigbang, etc...//
If you're a naturalist you cannot divorce yourself from either of those two. By necessity the naturalist has to explain how material began to exist and how life began to exist. To claim they are unrelated to evolutionary theory is inconsistent, therefore doesn't hold.

On the other hand, if you are a theistic evolutionist or an old earth creationist, yours is not a science problem, rather a Scriptural one.

**Otherguy:**  //your claim that it hasn't been tested, and that the title theory is only honorary is incredibly incorrect. Try doing some research//
Please enlighten me. Please post a link to a peer reviewed paper showing the multiple testing by scientific method that resulted in real time evolution wherein changes in allele frequency crossed familial taxa. Anything short of that and it remains hypothesis because it hasn't fulfilled scientific method.

You challenge me to do ""some research."" That's nothing more than an emotive challenge. I have obviously done far more research than you if you don't understand this very simple principle.

**Otherguy:** //It's simple common sense that DNA related features get passed on during breeding, and that the animals which breed more get more offspring. And because of the way DNA copies itself isn't perfect is how the deletion and insertion of DNA happens.//
True. Your extrapolation to the claim that this is somehow proof of universal common descent is what you'll have to provide evidence for.

**Edit: Me:** I wasn't equivocating evolution with the theory of evolution, i was using it as a segue. 

""Macroevolution"" and ""Microevolution"", don't exist in science. Small scale changes in allele frequencies over more time make more small scale changes. Eventually those differences become large, not the change amount. https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/c0.0.843.403/p843x403/156937_470648626307442_1395483628_n.jpg

Here is some research i was pointed towards: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/?term=evolution

//If you're a naturalist you cannot divorce yourself from either of those two. By necessity the naturalist has to explain how material began to exist and how life began to exist. To claim they are unrelated to evolutionary theory is inconsistent, therefore doesn't hold.//
That is like saying ""You can't explain how the moon got caught in orbit without explaining how the moon got there."" certainly you can. The moon could've been created by some being, but the way the moon got where it did has nothing to do with whether or not it was created, only about how it got where it did. You can accept the modern idea of how the moon got there without accepting the big bang. It is logically consistent, just not sound (but non-claims require no soundness). Accepting specific truths about the world around you doesn't prevent you from having differing epistemological points of view.

//Your extrapolation to the claim that this is somehow proof of universal common descent is what you'll have to provide evidence for.//
This comment leads me to believe that you refuse to acknowledge one of the three forms of logical reasoning ""Induction"" please explain why.

//On the other hand, if you are a theistic evolutionist or an old earth creationist, yours is not a science problem, rather a Scriptural one.//
Why would you use a single, unreliable book, as evidence for something? I can point to a segment of that book where it says god was defeated by iron chariots. Doesn't sound very powerful, certainly not powerful enough to create a universe.

//Actually, from all the arguments you've offered so far, it is much more likely that everything was created after its kind just like the Bible tells us.//
Can you give me some proof that your bible is reliable? I can give you plenty of examples of how it isn't, for instance: http://skeptoid.com/episodes/4191

Also, I have a question: How can you justify the rules god put in place before this new era where we don't have to listen to them, the ones from leviticus? You have to accept that those rules are just, because they come from god, but they don't seem to be.

At the core of it is pretty simply this--I think humans are fundamentally nasty creatures and atheists seem to be pretty optimistic that humans will do great things. 

My point of view comes from a few areas. I could start with the Milgram experiment, where people do what they're told to do, even if it means killing someone. I could also bring up the theory of diffusion of responsibility and the bystander effect in the aftermath of the Kitty Genovese murder, and talk about a psychology experiment I was part of in college, a relatively simple one where you just had to write down one thing you would do if you had no chance of getting caught--everyone in a group of 30 except for one or two people would get revenge or commit a crime of some sort. 

Then there's the personal side. I've experienced my share of bullies, and pretty much all of them were spurred to greater heights if I showed I was hurt by their actions. In my adult life my ex-fiancee had so little empathy she blamed me for being hurt when she cheated on me. There was also my bout with depression and the incredible lack of empathy I received from family and friends, who usually told me to suck it up or be a man or smile and be happy or some other piece of advice. 

There's also the problem that if there is no absolute right or wrong, then isn't all morality and legality just something a plurality of people decided on their own? If that's so, why hold yourself to someone else's standards? Why obey laws if you think you can get away with them? I read a quote from Penn Jillette that, when it's brought up in an argument that he can rape as many people as he wants to he already does, and that number is zero. Which is fine, I don't think everyone is a rapist, but on the other hand what about the rape case in Stubenville? The boys in that case didn't really have a problem raping a girl, and if any of them have shown remorse or let on in the slightest that their actions were wrong then I have yet to see it. What about the conflicting reports about Bernie Madoff's levels of remorse? 

So, that being said, I get that people can show empathy towards each other. On the other hand, it seems like that empathy can be very easily broken and that a lot of people, upon knowing they've hurt someone rationalize it away or become inspired to do worse. This bothers me a lot. I'd love to see the world the way the atheists I've talked with seem to, but I'm also starting to feel that having faith in humans to do the right thing and not hurt you when it's most convenient is almost naive. 

So I'm asking for a different point of view, and I would love to be proven wrong. Obviously people aren't backstabbing each other at the first opportunity, and obviously most people try to follow the laws most of the time. So what am I missing?

1. The existence of Jesus (this is not heavily debated, but needs to be said nonetheless)
2. The evidence he claimed to be divine and organized a church (1 Thessalonians was only written some 20 years after Jesus supposedly died.. And Paul, in this document, refers to ""we"" as if the Thessalonians should know who he is talking about, he refers to Jesus as LORD in a matter of fact way, not trying to convince anybody, and he refers to the apostles as if, once again, the Thessalonians already know who they are)

This seems like fairly strong circumstantial evidence that Jesus did in fact claim to be divine, and his followers started a church around him.

1357922762.0,6,self.DebateAnAtheist,16dwsl,A Dilemma: Corollary to the Ontological Proof,billsfan13594,19,13,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/16dwsl/a_dilemma_corollary_to_the_ontological_proof/,"To be brief (and brutally simplify as best I can), the Ontological Proof/Argument claims that God must exist because God is perfect, and since we can think of perfection or at least we can see that perfection could possibly exist, and because existence is part of perfection, God must exist.

However, my argument is not that God does or does not exist.  Rather, that man, a finite and flawed creature, cannot claim to know that God does not exist without necessarily contradicting himself.   In other words, Positive or Gnostic Atheism is logically untenable. 

Basically, it’s a dilemma.  If one claims to know that God is perfect beyond our understanding, we cannot claim to know whether or not he exists (he exists in a manner such that our mind is insufficient to determine whether or not a supernatural being exists.)  Thus, that is agnostic atheism; we are left with just a belief.  On the other hand, if you claim that God is perfect within our understanding, and we can know whether not he exists, you have just defined God in a way that necessitates his existence.  For, if God is perfect in the way we comprehend perfection, he cannot be flawed in any way.

Now, not existing is a flaw (I’m simplifying- if you want to respond with Kant’s criticism that existence is not a predicate- though I never fully agreed with that criticism- I would raise you with Alvin Plantinga’s response.  He argues that necessary existence is a valid predicate, because it describes not whether or not something exists but how; as opposed to contingent or impossible, existing necessarily, if God exists, is more perfect, as we know perfection.

The last paragraph I basically picked up from where Anselm and Alvin Plantinga left off.  If you don’t understand, that’s allright; it took weeks for me to kind understand the kinks in the logic and try to understand the ontological proof.  The major difference, I think, is that I don’t claim to know anything about God’s existence, but rather, that we can only think about God in a certain way, and that, to claim atheistic knowledge is self defeating due to the limitations of man.

So, again, a dilemma.  If you think of God as a being we can fully know, then he exists in a way that we know, which contains necessary existence.  If you think of God as beyond something we can fully know, we cannot claim to know his existence, or lack there.

As a note, this is me just experimenting above.  I necessarily agree with above; it occurred to and made sense, and I want to it to be critiqued.  Please, ask as many questions as you think of.  That way, I can either improve it or disregard and stop wasting my time.  



Edit:  Thanks all for the great responses;	just wanted to clarify that I do not believe the Ontological Argument proves God's existence.

""to have being in a specified place or with respect to understood limitations or conditions""

I've searched around and can't find any in-depth threads on this matter already, but please point me in the right direction if I've missed it.

I find that a large majority of atheists on the /r/atheism subreddit are pure empiricists, meaning they believe everything we know or believe is the result of, and can be justified through, observation and experience of the world.  I want to contest this point, and instead argue that empiricism cannot provide justification for all of our correct beliefs.  Now obviously if pure empiricism is best, then that means belief in God is easily dismissable because you don't empirically sense him.  But, if pure empiricism is inadequate, and empiricism is not always needed or sufficient for justification of true beliefs, then it opens up the path to alternate ways of justifying belief in God.  I do want to add as well that I am an atheist, and although I'm unpersuaded by all of the hypothetical arguments for God that don't rely on observation, I still recognize the theistic-door-opening potential of this position.

My argument is simply that empiricism requires a logical basis which empiricism  cannot provide to itself.  What I mean by this is that certain rules, like logic and mathematics, can ONLY derive justification from mental reflection, and not from experience of the external world.  In order to learn anything from experience (such as that certain rules of logic are justified), I need rules and structures for how to learn from my experiences.  Those rules and that structure obviously cannot come from those experiences - that would be circular.  Instead, it has to come from mental reflection that has no direct bearing on reality or how we experience it.  If math and logic are two things that fall into that category, then perhaps there are other things we can learn that affect the world as we understand it, but aren't subject to empirical testing or examination.

If this is the case (please let me know if it isn't) why is it that we humans are so unique? For every facet of our human nature, there is something that fulfills our nature as humans. I'm ignorant of an atheistic reason as such and would like to learn more. The differences I'm considering are the following:

1. We have the capacity for reason which is fulfilled by knowledge (it is fulfilling to our nature to know the truth about reality).
1. We have the capacity for relationships which is fulfilled by harmony within relationships e.g. friendship.
1. We are capable of performing deeds of excellence (e.g. art, music, construction, poetry, etc) which are fulfilled in skillful performance.
1. We are capable of appreciating beauty, exemplified by aesthetic appreciation.
1. We are free and self-determining in that we do not rely purely on instinct - we can go against our 'nature'.

Help?,broomroll,6,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/v31wu/primate_ancestor_odds_of_mutation_help/,"I am in a debate with a friend and he posted these odds for primates to have evolved into humans in 7 million years. What are your guys' thoughts/answers?
**Here is his post:**
&gt;So the changes they observed may just be forms of adaptation that the original organism was already capable of. And that means they may not have anything to do with Darwinian evolution whatsoever, because the researchers haven’t confirmed their genetic basis. I’d like to answer some of your general issues with ID, but they’re very broad, and like I said before I’d like to start focusing on the human evolution statistics, which I will now do. I’ll put some of my equations in these crazy things { }.

&gt;First off, you’re right, I did rehash a lot of what I had already said in my last message. I was attempting to explain my point in greater depth because you said you didn’t see the problem. I’m not going to argue with you too much about the exact difference between the modern and ancestral genomes, but I keep seeing the statement “96% similar” for modern humans and modern chimps, like at these websites: http://www.genome.gov/15515096; http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/08/0831_050831_chimp_genes.html. For the sake of discussion, I’ll stick with your source. The article you cited says that the change to modern humans would require “thirty-five million single-nucleotide changes, five million insertion/deletion events, and various chromosomal rearrangements.” This is supposed to have happened in a length of 5 million to 7 million years. Let’s just take the 35 million single nucleotide changes and neglect the other required types of mutations. Giving you the full 7 million years, that means 5 correct changes per year {35,000,000/7,000,000=5}. Earlier you estimated 20 years per generation, but I’ll be generous and bring it down to 15. That comes to 75 correct mutations per generation {15*5=75 ; 7,000,000/15=466,666.66… ; 75*466,666.66…=35,000,000} , and according to my prior source, only about 175 occur in one generation on average (for humans, but that's all I have to go on at this point).

&gt;Let’s say that the genome of our ancestor had an even three billion base pairs available for mutation, and that any given mutation is correct as long as it occurs in one of the 35 million correct places (which of course is not actually true, but it gives you another advantage). For the first generation, out of 3 billion pairs that can mutate, 35 million of them are changes that will move the species towards modern humans. That means the odds of getting one correct mutation are about 35 million/3 billion, or 7/600. With these odds, it is reasonable to expect that in the first generation, 2(.042) of the 175 mutations that occur will be the “correct” ones {(7/600)*175}. So obviously it’s against the odds to get 75 correct mutations, but just how against? After all, things “against the odds” happen constantly. Is the likelihood low enough to be a significant barrier to human evolution? This is where it gets pretty tricky mathematically, and I’ll try to justify every step I take as well I can.

&gt;So the problem is: if you have 3 billion candidates for mutation (the pairs within the genome), 35 million correct candidates for mutation (the number your article gave), and 175 opportunities for mutation (the estimate my article gave), what are the odds of getting 75 correct mutations (the number required per generation by my simple calculations above)? I quickly found myself incapable of calculating such odds, but I asked a more capable friend who pointed me in the direction of the binomial probabilities equation. It is explained (and can be calculated) here: http://vassarstats.net/textbook/ch5apx.html. The equation is used for calculating a probability where a certain number of trials will occur and a certain number of outcomes are required, much like our genetics problem. It works like this:
N = the number of opportunities for event x to occur [in this case, 175 mutations occur in a generation]
k = the number of times that event x occurs or is stipulated to occur [75 correct mutations need to occur]
p = the probability that event x will occur on any particular occasion [7/600 mutations are correct ones]
q = the probability that event x will not occur on any particular occasion [the opposite of the previous value; 593/600]
The probability of achieving k successes with N trials is calculated as:
[N!/k!(N-k)!]*[p^(k)]*[q^(N-k)]
With our values, it becomes:
[175!/(75!(175-75)!)][(7/600)^(75)][(593/600)^(175-75)]
I entered this equation into the website wolphramalpha.com (feel free to try it yourself), and it gave me the number 1.576… × 10^-95. This would mean that we should reasonably expect that 2 (rounding 1.6 up) out of every 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 members of our common ancestors' population would be lucky enough to have 75 of their 175 mutations be among the 35 million that will turn their offspring into modern humans (yes, I counted out all those zeros out… hah). You estimated that there were between 10,000 and 100,000 them at the time our lineage began, so it would be some pretty insane luck if any of them were able to accomplish this.

I'm wondering, after all the persecution atheists used to go through, how the average atheist feels about things like this. Do you feel that it just as wrong as when Christians used to do it to you? Do you feel as though it is somehow justified? Does it feel like satisfying revenge for past transgressions of Christians against atheists? etc.",,False,,t5_2ryfy,False,,,True,t3_t57yk,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/t57yk/how_do_you_feel_about_government_suppression_of/,

1. The belief that there are no gods and
2. The negation of theism

No atheist that I know accept either of those definitions.  The definition we tend to use is, ""atheism is the absence of belief in a higher power.""  No one outside the atheist community defines it this way; and to me this looks like nothing more than a cop out, because the argument we always use is that we don't have to justify our beliefs, as we are merely in the default position and it is up to the theist to prove their case.

 Is it really honest to claim to merely have a default position after having contemplated the subject of theism for countless hours, after we have examined all manner of philosophical arguments like the cosmological argument or spent decades of our lives in one religion or another?   Haven't the vast majority of us concluded gods are nothing more than a human concept?  Does this belief not need to be justified? Defining atheism as the absence of belief in gods seems like nothing more than a dishonest cop out we use when debating theists so we can avoid having to defend our position.

This is assuming that GI is capable of, like myself, creating a new religion, or at the least, inferring information *about* the religions of the world, as needed.

Without resorting to a response along the lines of ""whatever it felt like"" or ""flying spaghetti monster"", how might this GI entity rationalize its set of conditionals in existence (being the creation of another conscious entity, fate without rational cause, etc.) in a manner that humans have attempted to devise themselves?

Some specific questions:

    1) Would the GI hold humanity accountable for creating it in the first place? Why or why not?

    2) How would this affect the GI's perception of its creator, humanity?

    3) How would this affect the GI's perception of the future?

    4) How might it govern its actions into the future, based on answer 1?

If religious people will blindly follow the teachings of their religion, why don't churches spend time telling their followers to give their money to the homeless, or donate money to help pay for food for the starving. But instead of that, they tell their followers about how gay marriage will end the world, about how follows of the same basic religion with minor differences will go to hell, or god wants rich people to pay less taxes.
