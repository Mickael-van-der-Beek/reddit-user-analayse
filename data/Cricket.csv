Australia looking good early until the wicket of Watson on 19. A controversial decision had Khawaja out of an *cough* edge. Rogers hit a suberb 84 off 114 before a lack of concentration saw him plum LBW off the bowling of Swann. Clarke has played aggressively against the spin and is on 55 off 90 with Smith Slowly building a total. 

p.s I sincerely apologise to Redditors expecting more from this thread. I honestly thought the match day thread was a race to who could go first without getting downvoted into oblivion or from moderators who set the thread - i guess the former is the case. Sorry for the lack of updates as i also thought that a thread was to be posted and then let the reddit cricket community debate/discuss, banter/sledge and everything in between!

1373707094.0,96,self.Cricket,1i7lh3,Hey /r/Cricket. I made us a bot. Meet /u/howstat!,pranavrc,107,11,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1i7lh3/hey_rcricket_i_made_us_a_bot_meet_uhowstat/,"**PSA: /u/howstat's now here on /r/Cricket!** And it's off /r/howstat for a while.

If the bot behaves erratically in the test threads on /r/howstat, no sweat, guys, it's just me tinkering around with certain things and that happens. I promise that by the time it's on /r/cricket, it'll be level-headed.

**Update:** Added filter variants. Like both *test* and *tests* work now, for instance. *in* and *venue* do, too. Check it out below.

**Update 2:** Ranges in years. Scroll down to the filters.

-----

/u/howstat from /r/howstat

I felt that being able to whip up stats in-thread during match discussions would be very dandy. You know, kinda like a bot that can do all the Cricinfo-statistics-filtering legwork for you.

I'm currently testing the bot [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/howstat/comments/1i53bs/test/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/howstat/comments/1i78c7/test_2/). If you have feedback/feature requests or wanna help with testing (summoning the bot in a thread in /r/howstat), that would be as cool as a...gar.

------

**Summoning the bot:**

The bot responds when you call it with its name in a new line. The format of a request is this way:

*howstat &lt;player_name first, followed by optional filters, all separated by commas&gt;*

1. Case does not matter. odIS is the same as ODIs.
2. Please use the exact names for the filter values. ~~T20Is works, T20 doesn't.~~ Australia works, Aus doesn't.
3. Ditto filters. *at* works, *place* doesn't. *format odis* works, *in odis* doesn't. *in India* works, *at India* doesn't.
4. The request must be on a line of its own, a new line. The line must start with 'howstat'. 
5. The player's name must immediately follow the bot's name. Filters must follow the player's name, and can be in any order.
6. You can make no more than 3 requests in one comment. That should mean three different lines starting with 'howstat'.
7. Edits do NOT work. The bot does not revisit a comment that it has already dealt with.
8. Unless you specify a format, 'Overall' and 'Unfiltered' always indicate overall statistics in all formats combined.  
9. ~~As of now, the bot does not recognize players from the pre-ODI era. And sadly, yeah, that includes the Don too.~~

-----

**Filters added so far:**

*in* or *venue* - Venue Nation (See supported values below)

*at* - Home/Away/Neutral

*format* - Tests/Test/ODIs/ODI/T20Is/T20I/T20/All

*vs* or *against* - Opposition team

*year* - year/year range. Ranges can be of the form 'dd mmm yyyy-dd mmm yyyy' or 'mmm yyyy-mmm yyyy' or 'yyyy-yyyy'. The month and date are optional on either side. Please use just the first three letters for months. '13 Jan 2012-2013' is fine, '13 January 2012' won't work.

-----

**Supported Teams and Venues:**

Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, Bermuda, England, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Netherlands, New Zealand, Pakistan, Scotland, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Zimbabwe

-----

**Things that work:**

howstat lou vincent, at home, vs australia, year 2005, format odis  
howstat lou vincent, at home, vs australia, year 25 aug 2004-3 jun 2005, format odis  
howstat lou vincent, in australia, vs australia  
howstat lou vincent, year 2004-dec 2005  
howstat andy flower, at away, format tests, year may 2000-jul 2001  
howstat andy flower, year 2000-2001  
howstat andy flower,at away,format tests  
howstat andy flower

**Things that don't work (as of now):**

howstat lou vincent at home vs australia year 2005 format odis  
howstat lou vincent, at australia, vs australia  
howstat lou vincent, year jan 2001  
~~howstat lou vincent, in australia, against australia~~  
howstat kevin pietersen, at home, in south africa  
~~howstat don bradman - [see why](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1i7lh3/hey_rcricket_i_made_us_a_bot_meet_uhowstat/cb1yocm)~~  
howstat i love you  
howstat fuck yourself (Feature request?)

-----

**Some bla**:

The bot should respond within 1-2 minutes of a summon if everything goes well, or 61-121 seconds if nothing does.

I'm still working on the [code](http://github.com/pranavrc/howstat), so there's a fair bit more to come, and there might be some sneaky little bugs here and there.

-----

**Some more bla:**

Oh, and one more thing - since the bot's is a new account with very little karma (0 karma, to be exact), it cannot post in a subreddit more than once in 10 minutes unless it's been added as an approved submitter. 

So the bot is NOT active in /r/cricket right now, only in /r/howstat. Mods pl0x pl0x?

-----
**TL;DR**

BAWWWWT /u/howstat BAWWWWT /r/howstat

As you are no doubt aware things have been rather busy around here of late with the kick-off of the Ashes, and with that has come a whole lot of new subscribers. We figured that now was a good time to remind everyone of the sub-reddit rules which are listed in brief in the sidebar before the next test gets going.

To help explain the rules a bit better we've [added a page to the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/rules) to give a bit more information about each rule and the sorts of things that might cause a problem.

This is a great community and 99% of people have nothing to worry about (i.e. if you're not a spammer, troll, or deliberately malicious dickhead).

This also brings the current number of wiki pages to a massive 2. Huzzah! [You can view the wiki index here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/wiki/index). Not a massive amount of info there for sure but hey it's a start.

Cheers, and enjoy the cricket

Oh and if you could spare an upvote for visibility that'd be great (no karma for me for this self post). Thanks

###Match Events

*NB: All times are BST (GMT+1)*

*Massive thanks to /u/TheIntersect for all the gifs. God knows how s/he gets them up so quick.*

**1131** It's been a while since I last did a match thread but here we go! Steve Smith on this way to 100, Michael Clarke on his way to 150 and neither looking like getting out. What a dreadful day to be English!

**1140** *Dropped! (Sort of)* Swann at short extra cover gets the ball walloped at him. His desperate attempts to clutch the ball are in vein as it bursts through [(see here for gifs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbffogs). A few balls later, the *200 partnership* comes up between Clarke and our favourite Smith.

**1145** Broad comes into the attack to show them what's what and starts off by angling one in to Clarkie's pads. The next ball goes for a single as Clarke reaches his highest test total against England (137).

**1155** And Clarke moves the score away from triple Nelson. 334-3.

**1205** Swanny on to bowl after drinks. Let's have a look at the Revometer... and it's 2173 RPM!

**1208** *Wicket! Steve Smith - 89(196) c. Bairstow b. Swann - 343-4 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbffqtc) -* Swanny get's the breakthrough by dismissing our favourite Steve Smith. Smith goes for an elaborate slog-sweep and only gets a top edge on it and skies it to midwicket. Easy catch for Jonny Bairstow and we have to say goodbye to our sweet prince. Massive boos for Warner as he makes his way to the middle! [(gif - 'but I was saying ""booo-urns"")](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfivqj)

**1225** *Review!* Warner ""nicked it"" behind and is given out. Poor review, massive edge and we're back to old fashioned, no DRS cricket.

**1226** *Wicket! Warner - 5(10) c. Trott b. Swann - 365-5 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbffw2c) -* Swan turns it away from Warner who gets a fairly big edge. The ball hits Prior on the thigh and loops up to Trott at first slip. Pretty lucky for England but they'll take all the luck they can get! Chants of ""Cheerio"" ring out across the ground as Warner slumps back to the pavilion. Brad Haddin walks to the crease.

**1240** *Dropped!* Haddin gets a bottom edge trying to pull Anderson. Prior is moving to his right but has to quickly change direction diving down low to his left and doesn't quite get to the ball cleanly. The ball hits his wrist and pops out. [(gif right here)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfg49g)

**1259** Just received a Tesco delivery. 16 bottles of Cidré, 4 bottles of Rekorderlig and 3 bottles of Desperados for a tenner. Love getting discounts on things!

**1300** Lunch!

---

**Lunch on day 2 - Australia 392-5 - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/uhqR32d.png)**

And in Sky Sports' lunchtime feature, Sidmouth (ENG) beat Wattlesprigs (AUS) by 6 wickets with 6 overs left.

---

**1340** Swann kicks us off after lunch with some off-spin.

**1344** Broad at the other end to join Swanny.

**1420** *Wicket! Clarke - 187(314) b. Broad - 427-6 - [gif 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfh4wu) &amp; [gif 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfh78f) -* Broad finally gets his 200th wicket in tests! He bowls a fairly short ball to Clarke who has been running them down to third man all day, but this one comes into him a bit more than he expected and it hits the underside of his glove and drops onto the stumps. An unlucky end to a fantastic innings from a fantastic player, 13 runs from his double century too! Peter Siddle walks to the middle.

**1427** *Wicket! Siddle - 1(6) b. Swann - 430-7 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfh8i0) -* Swanny brings up his 5-fer by hitting Siddle's off-stump as he tries to cart Swann over midwicket. Left-hander Mitchell Starc takes up the striker's position.

**1443** Drinks! Australia are 439-7.

**1447** Quadruple Nelson and Starc tries hammering Swann down the ground but only manages to hit Brad Haddin. Good fielding by the Aussie batsman. [(gifs of the attempted murder)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfhlku) &amp; [(gif of a plastic bag drifting across the pitch)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfi3gw)

**1511** *Fifty up!* Brad Haddin brings up his 50 from 74 balls with a single. Australia 479-7.

**1518** *Hundred up!* All of England's frontline bowlers have now scored a century! [Well done boys!](http://i.imgur.com/evGt3tH.png)

**1536** *Five hundred up!* Australia are on 501-7 from 141.2 overs. Absolutely amazing batting so far.

**1538** *Fifty up!* Mitchell Starc brings his fifty up with a beautiful pull shot for four. 53 from 53 and no signs of slowing down! [(David Cameron wants this gif banned!)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfigov) &amp; [(gif of Mitchell Starc celebrating with a couple of England fans)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfiexf)

**1540** Tea time!

---

**Tea on day 2 - Australia 507-7 - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/nnVeSm0.png)**

---

**1600** Swanny on after tea. Australia to continue the torture.

**1605** *Big appeal - not out!* Joe Root rapps Mitchell Starc on the pads and England go up in appeal. The umpire gives it not out and everyone gets on with their lives. Australia attacking more against Root for obvious reasons. Hawkeye shows that the ball was going on to hit the top of leg stump but as ""Umpire's call."" [(gif of the real-time decision)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfizmq) &amp; [(gif of the Hawkeye decision)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfj1eo)

**1614** Australia declare!

***End of Australia's 1st innings - 527-7 dec - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/CKoaQhZ.png)***

***Start of England's 1st innings - Cook and Root to open***

**1624** England's innings is under way with Harris bowling the first over.

**1652** *Missed chance!* Wouldn't call this a drop by any means, but Cook just did a very similar thing to what Warner did in the first innings. The ball was nicked, ballooned up off the 'keeper's thigh and Michael Clarke was so close to catching it at slip, but he just couldn't get there quick enough. [(As always, gif of the incident)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfk0q5) &amp; [(A perfect gif showing the difference between the Warner wicket and the Cook non-wicket)](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfkbix)

**1748** Root has just hit a boundary!!! He moves onto 8 off 48 balls.

**1800** *Wicket! Root - 8(57) c. Haddin b. Siddle - 47-1 - [gif 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfljyx) &amp; [gif 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbflmlj) -* Fantastic delivery from Peter Siddle as it looks like the ball was going on to just go over the top of off. Root sticks hit bat there but the ball straightens and finds a thin edge. Simple catch for Haddin and Tim Bresnan walks to the crease.

**1818** *Wicket! Bresnan - 1(15) c. Haddin b. Siddle - 49-2 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jjjrb/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbfm113) -* Bresnan tries pulling a ball that is just too low down, gets an under edge on it and it sails through to the 'keeper. After some deliberation, Timmy walks off without reviewing. Replays show he missed it! Poor decision by Bresnan. Trott to the crease.

**1831** End of the day!

Our openers couldn't give us a decent start and we lost wickets at regular intervals all the while maintaining required run rate as singles and doubles were scored easily by some good running between the wickets.  I normally bat 6th or 7th, but given the wickets were falling quickly in the middle, my captain held be back and sent me in at #10 while the score read 72/8 at 14.4.

Knowing we needed 36 off of 32 balls, I relayed to my teammate at the other end that our goal is to run as hard as we can because the boundaries are going to be hard to come by given the condition of the field.  We were able to stick to the plan, but some dot balls in the middle hurt us badly, leaving us with 16 runs needed off of 7 balls with me on the strike.  I got lucky and the bowler bowled a full length ball at the middle stump which I was able to hit right over long on for a flat six!

My heart was already racing from combination of some hard running and the adrenaline rush.  My teammate takes strike on the first ball, which results in a single.  Next ball, I manage to get a single, leaving us with 8 runs needed off of 4 balls.  Third ball, teammate airs the ball over the mid-wicket just inside the boundary, but the fielder drops the catch resulting in us running for 2.  Now it's 6 runs off of 3 balls.  Beautiful cover drive past the cover fielder which resulted in another 2 runs for us.  In the next ball, the teammate slogs one past mid wicket, but ball got stopped in its track between 30 yard and the boundary.  I had already called for two and was about half way back when the fielder throws the ball at my end.  I knew at this point only way I was going to make it is if I dove for the crease.  I must have flown at least 5 feet in the air (or at least that's what it felt like) and I made it all the while the bowler failed to collect the ball.  

Last ball remaining in regulation, with 2 runs needed.  We chat in the middle while the fielding team is adjusting field to stop the single.  We had managed to score 34 runs in 31 balls and pretty much out of breath.  Only thing we knew was it was boundary or bust as running another double was going to be nearly impossible.  Teammate takes a deep breath as we walk to our ends and he's ready to take the strike.  Bowler charges in delivers a full length ball...a six!

I pretty much collapsed at this point while my teammates ran in and lifted us both in the air.  I am glad to say this was the most epic chase I have ever been part of that came down to the last ball.  We're 2-0 in T20s and one more win will ensure our spot in the playoffs.  Then starts the regular 40-over season.

TL;DR  Chased down 36 runs in 32 balls for the 9th wicket.  Needed 2 runs off of 1 ball and won with a six.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,,True,t3_1dceiw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1dceiw/hey_rcricket_i_dont_post_much_often_but_i_thought/,

This being the World Cup and all, it would make trash talking a lot easier and allow Indians to identiy Pakistanis and vice-versa easier too.

If enough people want this, than I can spend an hour or two doing this. 

EDIT: Ok, i'll do this then. I am too noob to fully automate this process, but I'll make a script to make adding to the CSS easier. An post will be made where people can add flags, just give me some time.
Look at the Pakistan flag next to my name as an example. Please vote to express your opinion!

I thought why not start a match thread right now as I can't already wait for it!

Let's have thoughts on the game, chances of teams and the playing XIs by then of both teams. And if I stay alive by then, I will surely post this thread again and we'll see who is the winner by then.

These are my expected sides, or what I hope are the sides by then:

**Pakistan XI:**

Nasir Jamshed (Should be pretty matured by then)

Mohammad Hafeez (Should remain Vice captain and might have added a bit more consistency, even if he doesn't he'll be in the team)

**Proper Consistent Batsman** (Should be a permanent member of the side and emerged as a terrific batsman - an *Angel*)

Asad Shafiq / Umar Amin (Whoever establishes him as the permanent batsman in the side by then)

Misbah-Ul-Haq (Captain)

Umar Akmal (No other choice for a place of an aggressive at No. 6)

Kamran Akmal (The experiment of his brother should have failed by then and he will be recalled)

Shahid Afridi (Afridi will be Afridi, you think he would change?)

Saeed Ajmal (Should be in the top 10 bowlers, otherwise we will be doomed)

Muhammad Irfan (Provided his fitness enables him)

Junaid Khan / Mohammad Aamir (Junaid definitely, and Amir if he comes back)


**India XI:**

I don't see any changes in India by then as the current team has recently won a title and we Asians usually have permanent spots after a major title win. The big question for India will be on 3 players:

**Virender Sehwag**

**Yuvraj Singh**

**Harbhajjan Singh**

I think out of these 3, only Yuvraj will be able to make it back to the XI.

And of course, whoever will win the toss will look to bat second. India will win.

###Match Updates:

*Note: All times are BST (GMT+1)*

*Note: Thanks to /u/TheIntersect for all gifs!*

**1146** Just woke up and showered so I'll be starting updates from here. Here are some gifs of Bell's and Prior's dismissals though. [Bell](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm1x5s) - [Prior](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm1xrp)

**1146** *Wicket! Stuart Broad 13(7) - c. Smith b. Harris - Eng 275-8 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm1yvp) -* Just as I start the updates Broad gets out! Harris, bowling round the wicket to the left-hander, bangs in a short one to Broad who fends it away from his head. The balls comes off the bat handle and loops up to 3rd slip. Harris gets a 6-fer and Swann comes in to bat for England.

**1201** *Drinks! - Eng 306-8 -* Bresnan carting it all over the place, Swann edging it for fun, great entertainment! (For the English)

**1222** *Wicket! Tim Bresnan 45(90) - c&amp;b. Harris - Eng 317-9 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm28y0) -* It's that man Harris again! A good length, straight delivery that Bresnan tries working through mid-wicket. The resulting leading edge goes right back to the bowler. Harris now has his career best figures of 7-fer. Anderson in for England.

**1225** *Dropped! Steve Smith drops Greame Swann! - [gif!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm2azk) -* Swanny tries to smash Nathan Lyon for a big six over long-on but doesn't get enough of it. Steve Smith comes round to take a fairly simple catch but can't cling onto it. Poor effort by Smith and Swann carries on banging it all over the place, mainly through/over cover.

Lyon - Eng 330 all out - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm2bss) -* Beaut of a delivery from Nathan Lyon from round the wicket to the left-hander. Jimmy gets a feather through to the 'keeper and walks off. Lyon finishes off with a 3-fer.

**1231 End of England's 2nd innings - 330 all out - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/ZI0io3A.png) - Australia need 299 runs to win, England need 10 wickets**

**1241 Start of Australia's 2nd innings - Rogers and Warner to open for Australia, Anderson to open for England**

**1251** *England review for LBW! - Umpire's call: Not out - 3rd umpire's decision: NOT OUT -* Replays show that the ball pitched outside leg and frankly it was obvious in real-time too. Wasted review from England who only have 1 left in the innings.

**1344** *Rain stopped play :( -* Big covers are on. I'll update here with any new info.

**1433** *Play to restart at 1450 -* [Here are the new times for the day's play.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm3v34)

**1449** *The umpires were lying! Play has restarted at 1449*

**1504** *Australia review! Rogers caught behind - Umpire's call: Out - 3rd umpire's decision: NOT OUT - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm493c) -* Another poor decision by Tony Hill. Replays show that the ball hit Roger's hip on the way through to Matt Prior.

**1510** *Dropped! Swann drops Rogers diving full-length at 2nd slip - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm4c9g) -* Top effort by Swann as Rogers edges it off Bresnan's bowling. He just can't hold onto it though with his right hand.

**1550** *Drinks!*

**1620** Match update due to boredom. I hope something happens in the next 3 minutes...

**1622** *100 up! -* That'll do! Something happened! Australia's highest opening partnership this series comes at a good time. Rogers &amp; Warner on 45 &amp; 48 respectively.

**1624** Shout out to /u/GurraJG who is updating us on the Ladies' Ashes in the comments below.

**1629** *50 up for Warner! -* Seems like I missed Warner getting his 50 as I was getting some food.


**1631** *Wicket! Chris Rogers 49(100) - c. Trott b. Swann - Aus 109-1 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm604w) -* England finally break this outstanding opening partnership thanks to Swann and his round-the-wicket off spin. Edged by Rogers to Trott at slip. Kawaja in for Australia.

**1634** *Nelson! Aus 111-1*

**1646** *Tea!*

---

**Tea - Australia 120-1 - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/aQPIVXQ.png) - Australia need 179 runs to win, England need 9 wickets**

Women's Ashes - England 126/6 (44 overs) trail Australia 331/6d by 205 runs.

---

**1712** Sorry guys! Forgot to mention tea had finished and play has started again.

**1726** *Wicket! Usman Kawaja 21(35) - LBW b. Swann - Aus 147-2 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm7adc) -* Swann bowls a full, straight ball to Kawaja, who seems to have let his pad get in the way of his bat as he tries to block it. He completely misses the ball and it hits him right in front of all three stumps. Plumb as you like. Michael Clarke comes to the middle and Swann stays round the wicket to the right hander.

**1744** *Wicket! David Warner 71(113) - c. Prior b. Bresnan - Aus 168-3 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm7kxg) -* Bresnan bowls a good length delivery just outside off to Warner which bounces up a little and nips away from the left hander. Warner gets a tickle of an edge through to the 'keeper and departs for a very well played 71. Steve Smith to the crease.

**1801** *England review! Smith caught behind - Umpire's call: Not out - 3rd umpire's decision: NOT OUT -* Good decision from Tony Hill [not a typo] as replays show that the ball came off Smith's hip. England have no reviews remaining.

**1811** *Wicket! Michael Clarke 21(27) - b. Broad - Aus 174-4 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm87v3) -* PEACH of a delivery from Broad, straightening a fair bit (1.9 degrees according to Hawkeye) and passing Clarke's outside edge to clip the very top of off stump. I hope /u/TheIntersect gets a gif up soon because that was gorgeous! (He has now!) Watson in for Australia.

**1822** *Wicket! Steve Smith 2(19) - b. Broad - Aus 175-5 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm8glz) -* Steve Smith tries hooking one short and down leg but somehow manages to drag it back in and down onto his stumps. An incredibly unlucky way of getting out for the man who isn't having a good day and Australia are living very dangerously now. Brad Haddin in to try and steady the ship.

**1828** *Australia review! Watson (obviously) LBW - Umpire's call: Out - 3rd umpire's decision: UMPIRES CALL (OUT)*

**1829** *Wicket! Shane Watson 2(11) - LBW b Bresnan - Aus 179-6 [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm8nd8)*

**1837** *Australia review! Haddin LBW - Umpire's call: Out - 3rd umpire's decision: UMPIRES CALL (OUT) -* Australia have no reviews left.

**1829** *Wicket! Brad Haddin 4(6) - LBW b Broad - Aus 181-7 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm8vxu) -* An INCREDIBLY close LBW decision, but Hawkeye shows that the umpire was correct and the ball was just clipping leg. Things looking bad for Australia now and, barring anything miraculous, England are sure to win this game and the series.

**1859** *Wicket! Ryan Harris 11(18) - LBW b Broad - Aus 199-8 - [gif 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9com) &amp; [gif 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9eq8) -* Broad bowls one that nips back a little and traps Harris in front of middle and leg. It looked absolutely plumb and Tony Hill (and Shane Warne) agrees with me. Nathan Lyon in for Australia.

**1901** England have taken the extra 30 minutes. Play will continue until 1930 local time.

**1903** *200 up!* Australia edge closer to the target with a nice boundary from Peter Siddle.

**1908** *Dropped! Swann dropps Lyon - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9mc4) -* Quite poor from Swann as the ball comes quickly to him at 2nd slip as Lyon attempts to leave it. Broad not happy as that would've been his 5-fer and 10th wicket in the match.

**1915** *Wicket! Nathan Lyon 8(10) - b. Broad - Aus 211-9 - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbm9qlv) -* Broad bowls a beauty of a full delivery. Swinging into Lyon and taking out his leg stick. Broad brings up his 10-fer in the match and Jackson Bird comes in. A quick-fire 50 wouldn't do the Aussies any harm here.

**1921** Joe Root comes on for England as Cook is told to bowl his slower bowlers.

**1926** *England take the extra half-hour -* But they still have to bowl Root and Swann.

**1929** The sun is back out and the pitch looks noticeably brighter. Broad starts warming up.

**1932** The sun has gone back in and Root has to carry on bowling instead of Broad.

**1934** The sun is back out and Jimmy Anderson comes on for Swann and Stuart Broad comes on for Root.

**1940** *Wicket! Peter Siddle 23(48) - c. Anderson b. Broad - Aus 224 all-out - [gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k6xvy/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_test/cbmabym) (this gif brought to you by /u/OlehHilly) -* Broad bowls one outside off, Siddle mis-times a cover drive to Anderson at cover. Broad picks up his 6-fer and 11-fer as England wrap up the game.

I want to hate the lot of them but they've not made it easy. We've given them a villain who will go down in Ashes folklore in Stuart Broad but who have they given us?

How can you dislike a fresh-faced 19 year old kid who smiles and bats like Agar did at Trent Bridge?

Then you've got Michael Clarke who every time I've seen him interviewed has come across as refreshingly open and honest instead of the bog standard interviewee.

My last hope was when the drunken, Root-punching, trouble magnet  with the gobby brother returned but what did he do in the press conference after being caught by Root? He joked about it! With a smile on his face!

Screw you Australia. Screw you.

These prices are for recently concluded, ongoing or upcoming test matches, ODIs, T20I or domestic matches. This list is no where near complete and if you know prices which are missing from the table feel free to make a comment and if you can find a link with the prices that would be great too. Once the IPL and some more of the county teams release their prices I might make another updated post in the future.

If multiple price categories exist for a ground then the minimum and maximum prices are shown. All prices are in Australian dollars.

Steve's son, Austin, seemed pretty talented, obviously helps when you can get coaching from a player like Steve. He had a pretty decent defence, and was great through the offside. He also played a few slog sweeps, one of his fathers signature shots.

In the 2nd innings, when they were in the field, the match got pretty tight towards the end. They were kind of losing the plot (Which is understandable, they are only 12/13yr olds). Steve was at the game, and in the last 10 overs he was walking around the field, so as to give advice to his son.(Rules of the comp state that coaches cannot give instruction to the players during overs, only during drinks/lunch/tea)

No rule about anything from the parents. Steve pretty much was setting the field for the team through his son lol. It worked and the batting team lost a few wickets. Match was still tight towards the end, and ended up finishing as a tie. Bother teams got 182 from their full 50 overs each.

Thought it would be interesting to share with you guys, cheers. And if you have any qu's about my meeting with Steve, just leave it in the comments.",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,nepal,True,t3_11uawk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/11uawk/i_umpired_steve_waughs_son_today_in_a_rep/,

###Stumps Day 3:   

England 294/7

England trail by 233 runs with 3 wickets remaining in the 1st innings and require 34 runs to avoid the follow-on.

---

**1124** *England avoid the follow-on* - With Broad's excellent shot through the offside for 4, England reach 329-7 and therefore avoid the follow-on. Moments later another 4 brings up the *50 partnership.*

**1129** *Broad out for 32 off 66 balls* - Broad attempts to block a Lyon delivery, and gets a thin edge. Hotspot confirms it is the correct decision. [Gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgni9d)

**1137** Here's an [ever-reliable weather](http://imgur.com/eAILzei) forecast if you were interested.

**1139** *Sort of dropped* - Prior strikes it hard, but doesn't fully connect. Smith is at full stretch in the field, but couldn't quite make the catch. Only a half-chance at best.

**1143** *Wicket! Swann out for 11* - Swann came out to attack, and leaves the crease soon after he arrived. An appeal after an inside edge seemed to have no reaction from Erasmus, but Swann decides to walk. A change of heart from the England batsmen? Hotspot again shows a clear edge. [Gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgnjjv)

**1202** *Drinks* - England currently 361/9. I'll be leaving temporarily, so ~~typically England will lose a wicket in the next 10 minutes.~~

**1217** Back, and thankfully no wickets. 368/9

**1220** *England all-out* - Siddle bowls and Prior top edges it up for an easy catch, out for 30. [Gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgnsir)

---

England: 368. Australia lead by 159. [Scorecard](http://imgur.com/V55c9sM)

---

**1229** *Warner and Rogers to open* - Two left-handers will open for Australia, with Anderson opening the bowling of course.

**1254** *derajydac says [he will deliver the pictures](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgo0d6)* - In other news, Australia going along nicely at 23-0

**1255** *Rogers edges to Prior* - As soon as I say Australia are going nicely, Rogers gets out with an edge to Prior. No need to review, Rogers walks straight off. [Gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgo14d)

**1301** Just in time for Lunch, [derajydac delivers!](http://imgur.com/a/8Ldw3)

---

**Lunch** Australia 24/1 Warner 12 (17), Khawaja 0 (2) off 7 overs. [Scorecard](http://imgur.com/j1EghTx)

Once again I am going out for a bit, so if somebody wants to take over for a few hours after lunch then they can.

---

**1506** I'm back and looks like I have missed some excitement. Australia now 103/4 after two quick wickets. Clarke is 1 (2) and Smith 0 (4)

**1515** *SIX!* - Steve Smith hits a glorious six, and the total is now 118/4. [Gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgpa65) [NSFW]

**1527** *Smith run out  for 19 off 19 balls* - A third umpire decision reveals Smith was outside the crease, and correctly(!) gives Smith out. Australia now 133/5

**1559** *Haddin caught by Broad for 11* - Haddin attempts to push on and get the quick runs Australia need, but gets caught by Broad short. Anderson picks up a wicket and they are 152/6

**1617** *Review! There's a noise as the ball passes Clarke's pads* - Not out. Nothing on the bat, and LBW is well down leg. [Gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgq5ok)

**1621** *Wicket! Swann makes an easy catch to dismiss Starc* - Anderson takes another wicket as Starc leaves for just 11. Australia 172/7. [Gif](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jo7p1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbgq7t7)

**1627** *Bad light stopped play* - In what is sure to be a controversial decision, the Umpires decide the light is not suitable to continue. Clarke is having a strong discussion with the Umpires, but they leave the field. Unless it suddenly brightens up this could be the end of play today. Australia are 172/7.

**1702** *Rain* - With rain coming down it is hard to see a restart in play possible tonight.

---

###Stumps Day 4:  
172/7

Australia lead by 331 runs with 3 wickets remaining. [Scorecard](http://imgur.com/RVM0gAq)

##Weather Updates

* @MichaelVaughan (~08:10) Covers are off .. Pitch looks greener than previous pitches at Egdebasten...!!! England will be delighted ..!!!
* @warne888 (~7:30) Report from Birmingham, the pitch looks a lot greener than previous games &amp;amp;amp; it's 11 degrees with a howling cold wind.... Stay warm guys !!
*  9.05 am Not good news. It's drizzling and the heavy duty covers are on, protecting the pitch and the square. The rain is not heavy at the moment but the precautions in place indicate more is expected. 
* 9.25 am The covers are still out in force, but so are the Indian players, going through some warm-up drills. Again, it's cloudy at the moment but no rain, just intermittent drizzle. 
* 9.35 am The covers are off for the moment and the warm-ups are in full flow. 
* 11:00 am Typical English weather. 
* 11.30am Update from the ground: the rain has stopped for now and some mopping up is underway. 
* 12.10pm The rain is heavy, says Nagraj from Edgbaston. ""Next inspection based on when it stops, mopping exercise has been going on continuously, the crowd continues to keep the faith."" 
* 16:20 Finally some cricket. What a fucking waste of day it has been so far.

I just wanted to find out if there would be any interest in a community map of /r/cricket? Something along [these](http://www.communitywalk.com/rdnb) lines, so that we could get an idea of the spread of cricket's reach throughout the world.

Thanks.

Edit: I think 20/30 people interested would probably be enough to  make it worthwhile and for those concerned about privacy, there's no need to post your exact location or even your username.

Edit 3: Okay, I guess there's enough interest, so I'll write another post in the next day or so with all the details and a link. Thanks for all your responses!

Edit 2: If it's not an idea you're on board with, then you don't need to add your voice to the discussion or your location to the map.

Due to yesterday's [misunderstanding](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jghd0/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/), it has been suggested that we restrict match thread creation to /u/CricMatchThread.

Practically, all this will mean is that if you haven't got the password already, you'll have to request it from the mods. This will be given out at the discretion of the mods.

As far as I can see the benefits would be:

* consistency of formatting from thread to thread

* OP wouldn't recieve thousands of profane orangereds during controversial moments

* Match Thread OP's would be, in a sense, mod-approved

The downsides:

* Mods aren't always around to respond to requests immediately

* Would require more heavy-handed moderation in terms of removing non- approved match threads.

Please upvote for visibility and post your opinions below.

Thanks.

**EDIT: You should now be able to see the traffic stats for /r/cricket too.**

i still remember the groans and the look of disappointment coming from the team, and in particular my Dad, who gave me the same look who gave me when i pooped on my grandmothers pristine lawn.  i could look in the eyes of my team, and no one really spoke to me.  and then this younger guy just tapped me on the shoulder as we were crossing at the end of the over and said, ""chin up kid, get the next one!"" 

he looked over and smiled at me every now and again and geave me a big thumbs up and a grin when i fielded the ball.  but a few overs later the same fat number 3, rocks back onto his back foot swivels and smashed the ball straight at me.  and i caught it.  

I couldn't believe it, my hands hurt and everyone ran over to congratulate me.  except for he bloke i caught, who asked me how old i was. and my dad said, old enough to play for us again!

I nearly cried! 

but my hands hurt.

This lesson has always stayed with me and i would love to hear more early cricket memories.  I am currently my teams top out field catcher with 5 in 3 games and no drops.  inspiration goes a long way.

It was a great year for the sub-reddit and for cricket in general, and we’d like to thank the whole community for making this place so great.

Now without further ado, the following are winners of the best of r/cricket 2012. Each winner will receive one month of reddit gold courtesy of the site admins who were kind enough to give the mods 5 gold credits per sub for best of awards this year. The gold will be distributed within a day or so.

-	**Best Post:** [Tendulkar + Zaheer Khan = Jacques Kallis](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/136c2m/tendulkar_zaheer_khan_jacques_kallis/) posted by /u/rtza. This category was very close, with the [November Trash Talk Thread]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/12g8h3/official_trash_talk_thread_november_2012/) finishing a very close second.

-	**Best Comment:** [The origin of ‘Gusset’](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/o2mwt/match_thread_india_vs_australia_2nd_test_scg_day_3/c3e0dxc) posted by /u/smurf42. A clear winner in this case. Note that smurf42 has been deemed winner as his comment turned the autocorrect mistake into the meme it is today.

-	**Best Submitter:** /u/jimsaysdoitthisway. Clear winner in votes.

-	**Best Commenter:** /u/jimsaysdoitthisway. Clear winner again, jim’s scooped the pool this year – great reward for quality posting over the year.

-	**Best Joke/Meme Post:** [My philosophy about this subreddit, even if I don’t agree with some posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/ry5ua/my_philosophy_about_this_subreddit_even_if_i_dont/) posted by /u/StrangerInAlps. Another close result, both other nominations only a couple of votes behind.

Now for what we thought were the best cricketing performances of 2012. These categories were included for interest only:

-	**Best Match of 2012:** [South Africa in Australia Test Series - 2nd Test at Adelaide](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/engine/match/573008.html). Clear winner. Who but a cricket fan would’ve thought a match which included a team batting at a run rate of only 1.67 an over could be voted best of the year? A rail nail-biter, and proof that the community here rates test cricket higher than all other formats.

-	**Best Batting Performance(s) of 2012:** [Michael Clarke 329* vs India](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-india-2011/content/story/548142.html) and [Faf du Plessis 110* vs Australia](http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/593809.html). Voting for both of these was so close I had to call it a tie, as the total score seemed to vary every time I opened the window to check the results! Two fantastic innings, deserving winners.

-	**Best Bowling Performance of 2012:** [Peter Siddle vs South Africa in the Adelaide Test](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/content/story/593277.html) Clear winner in votes. Match figures of 63.5 overs, 21 maidens, 6 for 195. A herculean effort leading an injured bowling attack to near-victory. Put in so much effort he missed the next test.

-	**Best Cricket Moment of 2012:** [Ricky Ponting’s retirement and the farewell given by South Africa](http://i.imgur.com/siH7p.jpg). Clear winner in votes. Australia’s leading run scorer, century maker, and most successful captain played his last test in 2012. The send-off given to him by South Africa was all class and fitting for one of the best cricketers to have played the game.

-	**Funniest Cricket Moment of 2012:** [Andrew Strauss breaks his own sunglasses with a throw](http://i.imgur.com/YO9g8.gif). Clear winner in votes. Amazing timing, hilarious moment. Might never happen again even if he tried to repeat it. 

So that wraps up the competition for the year, congratulations to the winners and thanks to everyone for the quality posting and commenting over the year. Let’s hope 2013 can be even bigger and better in the world of r/cricket.

Never felt more compelled to write as much as when Agar's innings came to an end.

Copy-pasted into a self-post to avoid blogspam

***

Ashton Agar, the man most of country had never heard of, became the talk of the nation overnight after his 98 runs saw him not only bring Australia back into the first Ashes test but create a story that even be remembered for generations to come.

That story starts with a 19-year-old who strolled to the crease with his team sitting at 9-117, a daunting 98 runs behind England, and lit up Trent Bridge with a flurry of shot making more befitting of an accomplished top order player.

Agar started out with a cool attitude and patience that seemed out of ordinary for a tail-ender. Was it by chance that the new kid had been defaulted to the bottom because of his lack of test experience? As he refused to get out, it became apparent that was the case.

Suddenly boundaries started to flow. England's short balls and attempts to give Agar a rough welcome into test cricket were pushed aside. The home side persisted in striding away from the tight line they had demolished the upper order with and paid the price for it.

Ashton had his 50 in as many deliveries and there was now more than a hint of concern among the home crowd and team. Who is this young man? Why is he at the bottom when his refuses to put a foot wrong with the bat? Turns out, many on the other side of the world were wondering the same thing, but with a much happier disposition.

Twitter blew up with #Ashtag and #Ashton making the rounds quicker than the youngster could find the boundary rope. That says a lot considering his golden innings consisted of 12 fours and a pair of sixes. Popularity stemmed not just from his surprisingly adept technique, but his demeanor and shot selection in an unfamiliar environment of big-stage cricket.

Sixty. Seventy. Eighty. Ninety. The runs kept coming. It was only in an Graeme Swann over where Agar finally looked like he was being truly tested. But he made it through.

Then the unbreakable kid from Western Australia finally snapped. He had missed several tempting pull shots from the hands of Stuart Broad before finally bashing one into the mitts of Swann in the deep on-side. The tactics that had done nothing to him early in his innings had finally lured him into a simple mistake, off a solid shot regardless.

It had been a long time since I had watched a sporting event where I felt my heart physically sink. I felt like I had been robbed of a moment, along with millions of others, when Swann celebrated like he removed Sachin Tendulkar in his prime.

Then Agar removed his helmet and beamed with a smile that forced a similar one out of me. He didn't care. He had helped lift a poor side into a winning position on cricket's biggest stage, the Ashes. That's what mattered to him. And suddenly I knew I had seen something that went beyond simply rewriting the record books.

Agar didn't just change the history books, he wrote himself into Australian sporting folklore. He had joined an elite company whose tales are those we know we will end up sharing with future generations. That's the importance of what many late-night viewers experienced on the 11th of July.

The man clearly knew how to make the most out of a situation, when he survived a stumping call with his team sitting at just 131. Turned out he thought sending that total to 280 would make a better story. That moment might have rattled a lesser player, but Agar clearly has a wonderful mental game that even his own selectors might not have been aware of.

Australia took of lead into the 2nd innings of England. A lead. From 98 runs down on the last wicket. Let the enormity of that sink in, if you hadn't already last night.

It would be criminal to forget the contribution of the man at the other end, Phil Hughes. Here's a man that has consistently had so much pressure applied towards his game, yet he was able to remain composed enough to assist his young teammate (and himself) in finding history.

Hughes ended his innings on 81 not out, having watched six of his teammates walk back to the pavilion before him. This was one of his finest moments in test cricket since his South Africa century in his early test days, and the history books may mention only his partnership contribution but he deserves an equal share of the imminent truckload of praise about to be heaped on his fellow young countryman.

In an innings full of highlights, none stand out more than a graceful on-side shot where Agar lofted his back foot high into the air as he put his body through the motions. It was clear from that moment that this kid had a future not just with the ball.

This is just a selection of the records that were broken on day 2 at Nottingham:

* Highest 10th wicket partnership in test cricket history, 163

* Highest score by a number 11 in test cricket history, beating last year's 95 effort by Timo Best by 3 runs

* Highest score by a number 11 on debut. More than doubles Wawrick Armstrong's 45 from 1902.

* 2nd fastest test 50 on debut, behind Adam Gilchrist

* 2nd debutant to finish with the highest test score at number 11

* The third time the 10th wicket pair have doubled their team's score (remember Lyon/Siddle in South Africa? 47? Yep, that's one of the others)

* 5th Australian 100-run 10th wicket partnership

Well played, young man. Well played.

* I don't know about you guys but it almost seems to me that the Indian team just doesn't care.. It seems to me that they never cared. The way their body language looks after the first day of every match is a testament of their non-chalance.

* Ishant said to the Australian players ""Wait till you come to India."" That's the problem! Indian wickets are not optimized to promote test cricket. They are made to kill test cricket. Indian pitches are fast bowler graveyards and the tests are all about which team's players can plonk their front foot down and smash the most runs. Watching a Test match in India is about empty stands and shitty games and the BCCI is to blame.

* A lot of people will say that players like Dravid and Tendulkar are untouchable. People get pissy when I criticize Laxman here on /r/cricket. I feel that its time they all fucked off.

* Dhoni can fuck off too. The truth is that he is not a Test captain. He made a lot of mistakes with strategy in the field. He did not perform with that bat. But all of that can be forgiven if his attitude was better. He just shrugs it all of and gives off the vibe that Test cricket is not important for him. We all know how intense all these guys will be when they play the IPL. Thats what they care about! Those who don't care about Test cricket should not be picked in the team!

* The BCCI needs to be made more transparent and more accountable to the fans. There needs to be some law or some change in something that ends the BCCI's secrecy and dominance in cricket. That is the bottom line. Edit Srikanth must go as chief selector

###Match Updates:

**Please see and respond to [this question](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k4zsx/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_4th/cblfe2a)**

**1159** *Lyon goes for 4* - Lyon is bowled LBW. Finger goes up quickly and Lyon walks off immediately. If it had been reviewed, it would have been considerably missing leg.

**1219** *Harris out LBW* - For some inexplicable reason Tony Hill gives Harris not out. It is reviewed, and even before the hawkeye Harris walks off. Hitting middle stump and the Australian innings ends. *Broad has a five wicket haul*

**1251** *Bowled him!* - A stunning delivery by Harris dismisses Root for just 2. Root never looked comfortable, but it was an excellent delivery to take the wicket.

**1400** *Cook swings wildy and is out* - Cook unnecessarily plays at a wide ball and is deservedly caught behind.

**1413** *Trott caught* - Trott plays at a bouncer and gloves it behind, caught by a leaping Haddin.

**1506** *50 partnership and 100 up* - A 2 deep to the boundary from Pietersen simultaneously brings up the 50 partnership and 100 from England. Both batsmen contributed 25 to the partnership.

Gifs are back! Keep up with them thanks to /u/TheIntersect

**1824** *Bairstow edges to Haddin* - Bairstow once again fails to get in properly, and edges a good delivery from Lyon. Bairstow out for 28. *Bresnan rises a place to bat before the day ends*

**1838** *Bell centruy!* - After surviving a risky edge that was just out of Clarke's reach, Bell chips one up and reaches his century with just 2 overs remaining today. An excellent innings.

###Stumps Day 2:   

England 52-2 trail by 475

---

**1400** *Pietersen reaches his 50* - Pietersen smashes Lyon for two consecutive sixes to reach his half-century in style.

**1443** *Drinks break* - England are currently 176-4 - Bell 32 (58), Pietersen 62 (94) 72 overs

**1446** *LBW Appeal* - Australia appeal for an LBW on Pietersen, but choose not to review it. Hawkeye shows he would have been given out.

**1520** *New ball taken* - England are 198-4 after 81 overs

**1542** *Bell reaches 50* - Bell clips it away for 3 to reach a half-century of 93 balls. It also signals the century partnership of 191 balls.

**1543** *That's tea* - England are 211-4 - Bell 51 (93), Pietersen 78 (143) 86 overs. [Scorecard](http://imgur.com/22z8pYH). England trail by 316.

**1618** *Bell bowled for 60* - I leave to go make a snack on a day of very few events, and sure enough someone gets out. Impeccable timing. A great delivery by Harris, Bell is trapped attempting to play a defensive shot. It seams in somewhat and clips the top of off-stump, meaning Bairstow now comes in. [Gifs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1jlsv1/match_thread_the_ashes_england_vs_australia_3rd/cbg6cdp)

**1645** *Pietersen gets his century* - Pietersen gets his 23rd test century off 165 balls. England now 245-5.

**1704** England currently 263-5 - Bairstow 16 (33), Pietersen 104 (176) 100.1 overs. I'll have to leave now, so if anyone else with the password wants to continue the match thread feel free too.

In a county match in England, Thomas was bowling to Richards and getting a few to whizz past the bat. After Richards played and missed another one, Thomas said: ""It's red, it's round.

Obviously if Sri Lanka beat Australia, Sri Lanka and England qualify with 4 points each.  If Australia beat Sri Lanka, this is what they need to do to overtake New Zealand's NRR and qualify:

* If Australia bat first, they need to win by 126 runs.
* If Australia bat second, it depends on the total they are chasing. They would need to catch 150 in 25 overs, 200 in 27 overs, 250 in 29 overs or 300 in 31 overs. 

(This is all assuming SL had 50 overs. Any rain shortening makes Aus's job much much harder)

1365749234.0,37,self.Cricket,1c6yex,"[Mod Post] New flair, a new mod, sledge threads, and a comment on the future",EyesAllOnFire,39,2,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1c6yex/mod_post_new_flair_a_new_mod_sledge_threads_and_a/,"Hello r/cricket! Just have a quick announcement to make about a few things of interest:

1. The flair system has been modified. The first change is that IPL teams have been added. This is part of a plan we have to implement more flair options - some people have requested IPL flair and considering this league is on right now we figured this would be a good place to start. There are plans to implement flair for other cricket leagues worldwide if there is enough interest (county cricket would probably be next - is there enough interest to support this?).

2. The second change to the flair system is that when you hover your mouse over someone's flair it should now pop-up to tell you who they're supporting. With new flair being added this should make it easier to tell who's who. Unfortunately the problem with this is that it does not apply to existing flair. So everyone that already has a country flag will need to reselect it if they want text to pop-up when people mouse hover over it. All new flair selected will have this done by default.

3. We've asked /u/sunnydelish to return as a moderator of r/cricket. For those that remember sunny, used to be a mod here until he was removed (unfairly) by previous mod BernieMadoff. People have recently noticed that we don't have any mods here from England/USA time zones and we agree that some help was needed to clear posts unfairly spam filtered in a timely manner. Please make sunny feel welcome.

4. Some people may have noticed a few users (or former users) recently making their thoughts known that they think r/cricket is heading in the wrong direction regarding post quality. At the moment we don't think there's a reason to make any changes to what can or can't be posted because we feel like we get a good mix of humour and discussion. As sub-reddits grow though they generally reach a point where they need to decide whether they want to start implementing stricter rules on content (things like banning memes and/or novelty accounts, making things self-post only etc). We just wanted to let everyone know that we won't be doing anything like that without asking you all first, so that any changes we make in future will be what the majority of the community wants. For now though nothing is planned on that front.

5. A lot of people enjoyed the couple of ""trash talk threads"" that we've had over the last few months, so I've put in some special formatting for them (similar to the match threads). I figure we should probably call them ""Sledge Threads"" too, for a bit of a cricket twist. Just create them like you would a match thread (start a new self-post with ""Sledge Thread:""). Note that all the rules about comment etiquette still apply in these threads so don't break them or you'll get the banhammer. They should be made for humorous stirring of the pot and nothing more (no direct insults or meaningless swearing comments please). Also, try not to make these too often but rather save them for special occasions (i.e. group multiple matches into one thread if possible).

Thanks for taking the time to read the above, it is a bit of a wall of text, and enjoy the domestic tournaments that are on during this period with little international cricket. This last southern hemisphere summer has been fantastic here, and we'd like to thank everyone for helping to make it so great.

tl;dr: new flair is available, we've added a new mod, we aren't making any major changes to the content here...yet, and you can now make sledge threads for FRIENDLY banter and gentle ribbing.",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,ca,True,t3_1c6yex,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1c6yex/mod_post_new_flair_a_new_mod_sledge_threads_and_a/,moderator

Apparently if someone plays every single match in this tournament, including the final, they will earn 170 pounds/257 dollars. Not 170,000, not even 1700. Just 170 pounds. 

That is absolutely pathetic. 

I got this from PakPassion btw, so it's a very legit source (they have connections all over the place with everything to do with Pakistan cricket). You can read the thread here: http://www.pakpassion.net/ppforum/showthread.php?t=175272

I also found this link that shows how much PCB pays its players: http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juauQtarAYHIKuUnSxfFwkNEvNPw?docId=CNG.54772f5d47fa56c8bfc69755c8092bcd.31

That shows that the highest paid players get $3400 per month, or $40,800 per year. I wonder how this compares to other boards? Of course sponsorships get them a bit more money, but I think only a small minority of guys like Afridi or Ajmal get anything significant from sponsorships. $40,800 for the highest paid cricketers in Pakistan sounds pretty pathetic. I think even Bangladesh or Sri Lanka pay their players a lot more. Plus their top guys get a lot more money playing IPL etc.

It's no wonder these guys end up doing anything for money. Being a cricketer for Pakistan is probably the worst financially out of all the major Test playing nations.

* Watching cricket on Indian TV is a nightmarish experience. Every single available inch of the screen is covered with ads. They sometimes cut the last and first balls of overs. Cricket is relegated to the back. 

* The BCCI's lack of transparency. They have a gag-order on the coach. We know literally nothing about Duncan Fletcher's strategies and plans for the team. The paying public deserves to be part of this important aspect of the game. We know nothing about selection meetings, except from media 'leaks'. BCCI staff are filled with cronies, patting each other on the back. The president owns a damn IPL team and claims that there is no conflict of interest.
*  Although this is getting slightly better, the bad infrastructure and lack of care for paying public. The near impossibility of getting tickets to an ODI, although we see hundreds of vacant seats in the stands.
* The BCCI's lack of support for the DRS, which regardless of its faults, makes the game so much for interesting for the TV viewer and definitely is more accurate than not.
* The music they play from speakers during IPL games, which robs venues of any individuality and replaces it with senseless pop babble.

The URL is http://cricket.addict.net.nz (hopefully it doesn't die too quickly)

It's only got data from test matches at the moment, and includes all of them up to the last [Aus vs SA test (#2064)](http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia-v-south-africa-2012/engine/match/573009.html)

The graphs show each innings for the player in match/innings order in blue and an average in red after each innings (I'm not sure if that's called a rolling average).

Some examples - [Alistair Cook](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/2473/chart), [Sachin Tendulkar](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/135/chart), [Sir Donald Bradman](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/640/chart), [Hashim Amla](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/26/chart), [Jacques Kallis](http://cricket.addict.net.nz/players/27/chart)

The graph gets a bit squished with the players that have a lot of innings.

One thing to note, specifically with the stats for Bradman - CricInfo has a smaller total runs than their own match lists (6996 vs 7068), so his average is lower. I'm not sure what's going on there, but it's probably true of other players as well.

1327821668.0,33,self.Cricket,p1hw2,In recent years test results have been dominated by the home team. One team bucks the trend.,siener,37,4,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/p1hw2/in_recent_years_test_results_have_been_dominated/,"Home ground advantage has always been a huge factor in test cricket.

I thought I'd investigate the phenomenon by looking at the last five years of test cricket using Cricinfo's Statsguru.

Unsurprisingly, the effect [is most pronounced](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=1;orderby=win_loss_ratio;spanmax2=29+Jan+2012;spanmin2=29+Jan+2007;spanval2=span;template=results;type=team) in India (they've lost only two home tests in the past five years), but England and Sri Lanka are right up there as well.

Look at [away games](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;home_or_away=2;orderby=win_loss_ratio;spanmax1=29+Jan+2012;spanmin1=29+Jan+2007;spanval1=span;template=results;type=team) and the picture looks completely different. Only three teams have won more than they've lost when not playing at home. Australia (won 9 lost 8) and England (won 8 lost 6) are only just on the right side of that ratio.

The team that stands out is South Africa. They've won almost three times as many away games as they've lost. In fact, SA's away record is actually better than their home record!

Looking at their [series results](http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;groupby=series;home_or_away=2;home_or_away=3;orderby=start;spanmax1=29+Jan+2012;spanmin1=29+Jan+2007;spanval1=span;team=3;template=results;type=team) one sees that they've not lost a single away series in the past five years. They won in Australia, England, Pakistan, the West Indies and Bangladesh and they drew in India (twice) and in the UAE against Pakistan. India's only two home defeats in tests during this period (mentioned above) were both at the hands of South Africa.

What is the point of all this? After England's loss against Pakistan and Australia'a whitewash of India some English and Aussie supporters started talking about the 2013 Ashes. It might just be a bit early for that - the Proteas will be visiting both your shores this year (and those of NZ), so be prepared!",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,safrica,True,t3_p1hw2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/p1hw2/in_recent_years_test_results_have_been_dominated/,

A competitive total, but, Wallsend boast a batsman with skills above the rest of the players in his age group. His average was 300 (with 600 runs scored in around 10 innings, and plenty of not outs). Medowie bowled him for 4 (reducing his average to a meagre 201.7) then rolled the rest to have Wallsend all out for 102.

So I got a pretty decent response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/r25mg/a_question_for_rcricket/), and as promised, I've now set up a map over at [Community Walk](http://www.communitywalk.com/rcricket/map/1490174). 

To add your marker to the map, you'll need to login.

Username: Redditcricket

Password: vivrichards

Then all you need to do is click ""Add Marker"" in the top left of the map. It'll ask for your location and give you several options on how to enter it, then once it's been added, you can add a description of yourself, your allegiance, even a photo or flag. It's pretty easy to use, but if you get stuck, just leave a comment and I'll try and answer any questions.


Hovering over the markers will display user name, clicking on it will display other details (if any)


I've also messaged the mods to see if we can get this in the sidebar as we add new members all the time.


Sorry to all those whose suggestions I didn't use, I'm limited by technical abilty, intelligence and time.

I've long advocated a 3 test (minimum), 3 ODI and 3 T20 format for standard series'. 

What I'd never thought of is holding the limited overs formats first. I think it's an excellent idea, first the olives, then the gazpacho soup and followed by the juicy T-bone of the test matches.

To me, it seems the perfect way to build up the test series. It puts it in context, first of all. Rivalries have already had a chance to develop, players have had a few knocks to get used to the conditions and it doesn't make the T20s and  ODIs seem like an afterthought tagged on the end of a test series.

For example, after England beat India in summer 2011 (sorry India fans, I bring this up because it's relevant), it was obvious that after a test series such as that, very few England fans (including myself) were going to give a gnats fart about an ODI series. 

Playing the limited overs first keeps them relevant and I hope to see more tours constructed in this way.",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,,True,t3_18t1uy,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/18t1uy/tour_compositioni_think_englands_tour_of_nz_is/,

Australia come in, what is the 100th test match @ the Sydney cricket ground, with a 1-0 lead against India, who surely are smarting from the defeat @ the MCG, where they lost in 4 days (yay for run on sentences). 

Australia, should remain unchanged, and unless something crazy happens so should India. 

Dhoni wins the TOSS and INDIA WILL BAT. 

Mark Nicholas asks Dhoni about Sachin as his 100th 100. Dhoni says, it does not matter to Sachin. They are focused on this match and have moved past Melbourne. 

Australia and India are indeed unchanged. Pink Day at the SCG today, and I urge you to donate to the [McGrath Foundation here](https://www2.mcgrathfoundation.com.au/donate.aspx)

Chappelli and Waz in their pitch report say that first couple of hours are for the bowlers, but then it should be a batsman's day after. 

***Lunch: India are 72/4***. Tendulkar and Kohli have both looked very very good. Virat should like this surface, very similar to the DDCA surface back in delhi that serves as the training ground for the Delhi Ranji team. I think he has the game to do well at the SCG. Whether I shall be eating humble pie, remains to be seen.

**England require another 23 runs with 3 wickets and 10 balls remaining**

**England require another 14 runs with 3 wickets and 7  balls remaining**

** TT Bresnan b Chawla 14 (9b) England 325-8 (49)** 

**England needs 14 in 6 balls** WHAT A GAME.

** England need 12 of 5 balls**

** England need 11 of 4 balls** 

**SIX ENGLAND NEED 5 of 3 balls**

** 1 BYE 4 from 2 **

** England need 1 to tie 2 to win from 1 ball**

**  ITS A TIE ** Fair result i guess.

Fourth tied game in World Cup history.

Pakistan won the warm-up match against South Africa before the tournament, but that didn't count. South Africa won the series 3-2 against Pakistan but that is also gone. Without Steyn, it will be an interesting contest. Pakistan will be itching to bring Abdur Rehman in the side, but there is no vacant spot. Amla, Ajmal, Misbah and AB will be the most important players in the park today.

Anyways, an almost must **WIN** situation for both teams as both the teams have lost their opening encounters. But even if one of the teams lose today, this is then what their respective fans will have to do:

**Case 1:**

If **Pakistan lose today**, their fans will have to pray hard. That pray will consist of three distinct parts (and every part is damn important):

1. West Indies win against India tomorrow.

2. West Indies win against South Africa on June 14.

3. Pakistan win against India on June 15 and maintain a better run rate than India and South Africa.

**Case 2:**

If **South Africa lose today**, their fans will have to pray with another set of prayers:

1. India win against West Indies tomorrow.

2. South Africa win against West Indies on June 14.

3. India win against Pakistan on June 15 and destroy the run rate of Pakistan in such a way that South Africa go through.

3. Clarke has problems in setting up the field for spinners, Puts 4 men on the boundary with no more than one attcking fielder. leaks a lot of singles.
4. Clarke has been the man so far, increasingly friendlier with the crowd. He was dancing as per crowd request , There's a display board which shows messages from the crowd and it went more and more clarke oriented towards the end of day. He has so far won the hearts of Chennai people.
5. Sachin's 3 fours saw the stadium erupt in noise more than the entrance to which one of girlfriends of Aussie Supporter quipped  ""this alone is worh watching here""
6. Liz Hurley was seen in the Box. Not many recognised her though.
7. The Ground is packed but many seats may seem empty but it's due to the Sun ,people are rushing to the shadier places of the stand and jostling themselves rather than watching in the Sun.
8. TNCA as of course is crap , No Re-entry allowed and the food still sucks. They have to be more friendlier.
9. Many people went back as ticket counter are only open for an hour, they should increase the duration of the opening hours so that All seats are sold.

In a nutshell the site admins have invited each subreddit to have their own awards for the best things that have happened in each sub this year. A summary and links to each contest can be [found in this subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof2012).

So here's where everyone comes in: we'd like people to post nominations and ideas for the ""Best of r/cricket 2012 awards"" in this thread. I will post parent comments for the categories I believe we should have, please post your nominations for those categories as replies to those parent comments. Also, please feel free to suggest some more categories if you think it will enhance the competition.

Once we have the categories and nominations sorted out, we'll post special ""contest mode"" threads for you to vote for the winners. These threads are new features that have been added to reddit where the comments are randomly ordered and the vote tallies kept secret. We'll announce the winners at a later date.

Current reddit-related awards in the list:

- **Best r/cricket post of 2012**

- **Best r/cricket comment of 2012**

- **Best submitter on r/cricket 2012**

- **Best commenter on r/cricket 2012**

- **(Last category TBD: open to community suggestions)**

Winners of the above will receive reddit gold.

I also thought it would be fun to have some non-reddit related best ofs, to sort out what we think were cricket's best in 2012. Therefore, the following categories will also accept nominations:

- **Best match of 2012 (any format)**

- **Best batting innings of 2012 (any format)**

- **Best bowling performance of 2012 (any format)**

- **Best cricketing moment of 2012**

- **Funniest cricketing moment of 2012**

All of the above is open for discussion/comment so we'll tailor the competition to what the majority want it to be. Start making your nominations and we'll announce the voting threads once we feel we have enough nominations to get started.

It was the first time they had won a series in England since readmission (having drawn 1-1 won in 1994, lost 2-1 in 1998, and drawn 2-2 in 2003). 

Three months later they followed up by beating Australia 1-2 away also for the first time since readmission (having drawn 1-1 in 1993/94, lost 1-0 in 1997/97, lost ***3-0*** in 2001/02 and drawn 2-2 in 2005/06).

Fast forward 4 years and history has repeated itself with South Africa beating England 0-2 and Australia 0-1 in the space of 3 months.

I am an extremely proud South African today. The character we have shown over both of these recent series has been world class. We are blessed with some outstanding talents in Steyn, Kallis and Amla - AB was not at his best but is also extremely talented - but, for the first time, we are getting the best out of our raw talent.

Huge credit must go to Gary Kirsten (second consecutive side he has coached to number 1) and his team. We couldn't have done this without them.

1335649038.0,31,self.Cricket,sxaqx,Hey. I'm the guy who recently became a captain. Here to update you on the start of our season,BoyNamedDavid,31,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/sxaqx/hey_im_the_guy_who_recently_became_a_captain_here/,"So on a sunny, yet chilly Saturday afternoon in Scotland. The team and I took to the field to launch our 2012 cricket season. 

We had managed to get a full XI out, and as a matter of fact the strongest line up we've put out in my entire memory at the club.

After winning the toss, I elected to bowl first.

Myself and a seasoned member opened the bowling. After a few looseners, we soon hit our areas and quickly removed the opening pair.
And soon after fell the wickets of the 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th wickets for under ten runs (they were 8-6 at one point). 

I had quickly gathered the wickets and had attained my maiden 5-wicket haul.


At this point I brought in my first change bowlers, a medium pacer and a fast slingy action. The score was kept tight, few runs conceded and more wickets fell until the opposition were 27-9. One last change and the final wicket fell to our spinner.

After demolishing the opposition with the ball we had a slender target of 28 to win the match.

At this point, I shuffled our batting order to allow new members and also members who perhaps needed a little bat higher up the order.
And in a short period of time we had chased down the target for the loss of three wickets.

An important success was the intensity in the field for us. We didn't have to do much, but when we did we carried it out flawlessly.
3 catches in slip, 1 by wicket keeper, 1 at gully and 1 at mid-off.

The taking of catches in slip was key to the removal of the top 4 batsmen. And something which a specific fielding pre-season session has enabled us to hit the ground running with.

The game today has allowed us to throw the gauntlet down to the rest of the league opposition. An intimidating win in which we completed a game in 2 hours where we would normally be spending nearer 5 to 6 hours playing.

I'm not getting carried away though, there are plenty of good cricketers in our league, and we will need to stay on top of our game to keep a promotion push going.

On a personal note though; I was ecstatic about getting my first 5-wicket haul today. Best feeling ever. [finished with figures of 4 overs, 0 maidens, 5 wickets for 6 runs]

PS: If [/r/cricket](/r/cricket) doesn't want to hear from me anymore I'm more than happy stop posting. Just thought I'd keep you updated with what started last year, when I asked you all for advice.

I have started watching the Caribbean Twenty20 matched and am really enjoying the sport. Some things can be very confusing, perhaps more so as an American. 
In an actual match I think I have most of the rules down, bowls, overs, wickets, the progression of the lineups and the scoring methods. 

What is very confusing to me is what First Class, List A, or the other groupings mean. Is this a sort of Major/Minor league system or just formats of play and tournaments? 
Also I see there is talk about the England/Pakistan ""Test"" that just happened, Is this an international friendly of sort or more of a step towards a World Cup like event. 

Thanks for the answers in advance.

Edit 1: Wow, thanks for all the info, really sorts it out. Hopefully I will have the opportunity to take in some test matches in the near future and see the more traditional side of the game.

I would almost go as far as to say we've attempted something I don't think anyone else has in this sense. 

That taken into consideration I would say today was pretty damn successful.  I have received at least 30 messages saying how great and refreshing it has been to listen to people talking about cricket who do have opinions and don't dance around the topic to not offend anyone. 

We peaked at 84 listeners at the highest, and the lowest during the stream at any one time was 11. That was probably when I decided to go buy beer and leave my computers unattended and the stream crashed. Sorry to anyone who had to endure the stick cricket fiasco it won't happen again. 

Something else cool to mention is to just think of the logistics of what we accomplished. We had complete strangers from,  Australia,  England. Ireland, Canada Pakistan, China, New Zealand, India and South Africa all turn up to a random voice chat and instantly connect over something we all love. There was no rudeness or bitterness it was all about the love of our cricket. Bloody awesome I must say. 

A few things for tomorrow. I was going to suggest people staying out of the google hangout unless they are commentating or are just about to, I have thought about this and I think I'll still allow everyone to join in but to stress a few points. Web cams always off. If it's not your turn make sure you are muted. Make sure you don't mute the other people on the hangout. 

We hit 84 listeners at the peak. Lets try get 100 tomorrow and try hold it around that mark. 

Anywhere you can post the mixlr.com link is a bonus. Hopefully we can cross post it in a few different subs tomorrow with some success. Any streams, sports sites Facebook twitter etc are all great and will help us talk to more people. 

Lets also try be more interactive with the reddit stream and ask questions to be answered there or on the chat. 

The delay between the streams is obviously an issue and until I figure a way to stream the commentary over a video stream it's going to stay an issue. I will find a way asap. 

In the meantime what we kind of defaulted to doing was having great discussions about cricket, the state of cricket in many locations around the world and current hot topics. DRS anyone? Which people absolutely loved so with more chat and reddit interaction it will be a winning formula. 

So after that giant wall of text I'll just say a massive thank you to you guys for turning one little crazy idea into this. I hope you will all stick with me/us while we try grow this thing and iron out all the bugs. Without all your knowledge of cricket in various aspects today would of been a disaster. 

Also thanks to all the mods on r/cricket absolute champs. 

So one last celebratory 2am beer before bed for a great day of cricket and some new mates.

1333863673.0,31,self.Cricket,ryxbg,An American view of the IPL,mimicthefrench,35,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/ryxbg/an_american_view_of_the_ipl/,"So after following cricket for 4 months and being thoroughly entertained by every level of the sport I've watched, from pickup games on my college campus to international test matches, I decided to pull up a stream of an IPL match today while in the studio sketching some stuff for my Design Communications class.

First of all, I now understand the purists' view of the IPL, and why a lot of people are not fond of it. It's loud, it's obnoxious, it's in your face. Advertising is everywhere, and the whole thing is highly commercialized. T20 doesn't have as much strategy, nor as much nuance as test or even ODI cricket. I also could not really identify with any of the teams, since it's not clear what identities they have in terms of fanbase, style of play, etc. All of this bothered me, probably almost as much as it bothers any of you.

But to an outsider like myself who's lived with baseball, basketball, and American football for 19 years, this felt more like the sports I'm used to. It was comparable in length to an American football or baseball game, and it was exciting the whole way through. Due to the T20 format, both teams were extremely aggressive when batting, and therefore the run rates were higher and wickets fell more often. The crowd was very large and very loud, and the announcers were much closer to the ""all excitement, all the time"" of American sports. The advertising did not bother me all that much - in fact, it had far fewer ad breaks than I expected. I was surprised during the ""strategy timeout"" that they did not cut to commercials, something any American network would have done without hesitation, and instead used that time to discuss the finer points of some of the strategy that might be used by the teams. 

If anything is going to make cricket break into the US, it would have to be something like the IPL: loud, proud, and unashamedly outrageous. A couple of my friends in the studio with me came over at one point and were immediately drawn to the game in a way they hadn't been on a previous occasion when I had been watching an ODI match. 

It has its positives and negatives, but to me at least, the positives are great enough that the IPL should be considered, at the least, a valid version of the sport. I think I used the analogy of NASCAR and Formula 1 the other day to explain why both IPL-style T20 and longer-form, more traditional cricket can coexist peacefully: Sure, T20 and NASCAR dumb down their respective sports to reach a more causal audience, but they're not stealing viewers or money from each other, save for the occasions they happen to coincide on the calendar. NASCAR is easy for the less-sophisticated amongst us (coughstupidamericanslikemecoughcough) but some of those fans will find their way to other versions of the sport. In the same way, people who perhaps don't really care enough or know enough about cricket to sit down for a full ODI match might find the IPL a more welcoming place to start, but then get drawn in by the beauty of the game and perhaps end up as fans of the sport as a whole and not just that one version of it.


tl;dr: IPL has its ups and downs but in the end, the more the merrier.


Wow that's a lot of text. I'd love to hear some other viewpoints, so comment away :)

###Match Events

*NB: All times are BST (GMT+1)*

**1101**  *New ball taken* and Tim Southee gets play underway with a wayward delivery down leg.

**1104** Trent Boult to join Tim Southee in taking the new ball.

**1121** [What better way to watch the cricket?](http://i.imgur.com/BVBZUog.jpg) Also, the tide is going out. Low tide at 1251.

**1136** Wagner introduced to the attack. Michael Atherton has left the commentating room to throw himself under an All-Blacks' scrum.

**1214** *Wicket! Joe Root - c. Watling b. Southee - 192-5 -* Strangled down leg! Attempted leg-glance turns into a thin edge that goes through to the 'keeper. Matt Prior comes to the crease.

**1217** *Wicket! Matt Prior - lbw b. Southee - 192-6 -* And Matt Prior goes first ball! Prior gets trapped in front, it looked absolutely plum, the umpire gave him out, but Prior reviewed it. [Not a good choice by the looks of this.](http://i.imgur.com/WeX1SL5.jpg) Broad comes to the crease. Southee on a hat-trick.

**1224** *Wicket! Stuart Broad - lbw b. Wagner - 195-7 -* Broad gets a beauty from Wagner! Pitches full on middle, hits him in the shin, and Broad walks off with his head bowed. [I'm not convinced though.](http://i.imgur.com/oDnIvxp.jpg) Graeme Swann comes to the crease.

**1230** 200 up for England! 200-7.

**1235** *Wicket! Graeme Swann - c. Watling b. Wagner - 201-8 -* Swann found an outside-edge on a full, outside-off delivery. Simple catch for the 'keeper and England are folding like a master of origami! Finn in for England.

**1301 - Lunch - England 209-8** Fantastic session from New Zealand. Wagner and Southee taking control of this bowling attack and being rewarded with a handful of wickets in a handful of minutes. Things are looking gloomy for England, as is the sky at Lords.

---

**[--Scorecard at lunch--](http://i.imgur.com/OILMhGR.png)**

---

**1340** The afternoon session starts.

**1406** *Wicket! Steven Finn - lbw b. Southee - 221-9 -* Finny playing for the outswinger when it didn't come! Trapped plum in front. [There's no arguing with that decision.](http://i.imgur.com/LwW900w.jpg) Jimmy Anderson walks to the crease.

**1418** *Wicket! Johnny Bairstow - c&amp;b. Southee - 232 all out -* Fantastic reaction catch from Southee as Johnny tries to clobber him down the ground. A dismal conclusion of the innings for England.

**--End of England's 1st Innings - [Scorecard](http://i.imgur.com/gvouDdH.png)--**

**--New Zealand's 1st Innings--**

**1429** Jimmy Anderson, [who is 2 wickets shy of his triple-century](http://i.imgur.com/6hOHPRp.jpg), starts with a wide delivery outside-off.

**1433** *Wicket! Hamish Rutherford - c. Cook b. Anderson - 5-1 -* Fantastic start for Jimmy! Moving slightly away from the left-hander, finding the outside edge to Cookie at first-slip. One away from 300 test wickets for big Jimmy!

**1435** Stuart Broad to share the new ball with Andserson.

**1459** *Wicket! Peter Fulton - c. Swann b. Anderson - 7-2 -* And he's done it! Jimmy has his 300th test wicket, taking the outside-edge of Fulton. Swann takes a brilliant catch down low at second-slip.

**1558 - Tea - New Zealand 54-2** Poor start from New Zealand, but they've steadied the ship and the English bowlers haven't looked threatening at all in the past hour.

---

**[--Scorecard at tea--](http://i.imgur.com/I391fXd.png)**

---

**1618** The evening session starts.

**1642** *Fifty up for Ross Taylor!* Coming off only 49 balls too! He'll be looking to push on for his century now after a fantastic base that he's set himself.

**1714** *Wicket! Ross Taylor - lbw b. Anderson - 100-3 -* After a fantastic knock of 66 from 72 balls, Taylor is [trapped in front](http://i.imgur.com/nD6kDYp.jpg) by Jimmy. Dean Brownlie steps into the middle.

**1734** *Dropped!* Kane Williamson got a faint outside-edge from a wonderful Jimmy Anderson delivery, but Prior just [couldn't hold onto it](http://i.imgur.com/CPtDVN9.jpg).

**1750** *Not reviewed!* Williamson looks to have feathered one down leg. Everyone goes up, but Mr Umpire doesn't give it. After a very brief chat, Cook decides not to review. Decide for yourself: [Hotspot](http://i.imgur.com/YLdfnJF.png) and [Snicko](http://i.imgur.com/cgCMdcq.jpg).

**1816** *Wicket! Dean Brownlie - lbw b. Steven Finn - 147-4 -* After the umpire gave it not out after hearing two noises, England referred the decision. It looked like the ball hit both the front pad and the back pad, which explained the two noises. [Decision overturned!](http://i.imgur.com/iYDoFhe.jpg) Brendon McCullum in to bat.

**1825** Surprisingly, Steven Finn is the first person to bowl a no-ball of this variety! [This is a monumentous day.](http://i.imgur.com/6aJvwk8.jpg)

**1838** Cookie [told by the umpires](http://i.imgur.com/y9YOAxZ.jpg) that Trotty and Swanny have to bowl due to bad light.

**1843 - Close of play - Bad light - New Zealand 153-4** And five minutes after the umpires tell Trotty to start bowling, [they bring the players off for bad light](http://i.imgur.com/njIu8wG.jpg). Good day for New Zealand.

1360411343.0,30,self.Cricket,186to0,Ben Hilfenhaus - Australia's most recently forgotten man - why he should be in the squad against India,riely,32,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/186to0/ben_hilfenhaus_australias_most_recently_forgotten/,"With all the selection debate appearing to revolve around the selection of Steve Smith ahead of the likes of George Bailey and Alex Doolan for Australia's Indian tour, I feel like Ben Hilfenhaus has missed out severely. What ever happened to giving our players a ""fair go""?

Hilfenhaus is currently ranked as the world's 10th best test bowler by the ICC. He is ranked ahead of names such as Johnson, Starc and Pattinson, aswell as others such as Broad, Rehman, Khan and Umar Gul. He is a *single point* behind Morne Morkel in these rankings. While I'll admit these may not refer explicitly to current form, they do show how consistent Hilfenhaus has been over the last 18-24 months in test cricket. You must have done something right if you can miss out on  3.5 tests in the summer and still hold a place in the top 10 rankings.

Furthermore, he has a bowling average of just 22 against India, while he averaged a mere 17.22 in their last series just over 12 months ago. This proves he's been a problem for the Indian batsmen and mentally (if not otherwise) he could pose a threat even on the Indian pitches. 

Lastly - while his first 2 games this summer weren't amazing - he still averaged 34, which isn't terrible against the world's number 1 ranked test nation and the likes of Kallis, Amla and de Villiers. Should we really be dropping players because they had 2 relatively uneventful games despite demolishing opposition in the series' leading up to those two games? No, we should not.

Just to give you some context on Hilfenhaus' apparently ""mediocre"" matches against South Africa - in those same 2 matches Peter Siddle averaged over 38 with the ball, as did James Pattinson. Hilfenhaus averaged 34. I understand he was injured in the first match against Sri Lanka but the figures speak for themselves. Now fully fit, he should be going to India. He isn't. Selectors, well done once again.

I prefer T20, but also enjoy the other forms.  Just a couple of questions, if anyone can oblige:

1) I notice most teams (I think) put their best batsmen up 3/4th, I'm assuming to allow for partnerships with 2/5 etc.  But why then do many teams use their power play in overs 1-5?  Wouldn't you want to either put them in the middle where your big guns will be, or at the very end to help the weakest batters?

2) for the biggest nations, with deep talent pools, why don't the T20 squads look more different than the Test teams?  Isn't the mentality 100% different, both batting and bowling?  Wouldn't you want different personalities for each?

3)  Do Captains plan to have specific bowlers matched against specific partnerships, or do they say prior to the match, you're bowling overs 1-2, etc.?  Why do they sometimes change bowlers out that seem to be having a lot of success?

4) Last but not least, what's the average salary for the average player in the IPL, and for a ""star"" player?

I do not feel comfortable charging against spinners and lofting them over their head. Will appreciate any comments on what my technique should be. If you have a link of a certain player playing straight drive using his feet against slow bowler, feel free to use it in support of your advice. many thanks

**Update**: Thanks for the response guys. Few things that i didn't mention first time around:)
I am half-decent right-hand batter (being modest here). Have scored 750 League runs @ average of 65 (in last season) in Division 1 of (Amateur league) where 20 other teams take part
--&gt;English conditions and mostly uncovered pitches so you have to negate the unpredictability of pitches!
--&gt;The reason i have scored so many runs is because i play late and put a high premium on my wicket.
--&gt; Don't face many spinners in the league but when i do i can easily negate them by playing sweep or just blocking out! Sweep is kind of my release-pressure shot and i connect more often than not :)
--&gt; I feel one way to improve my batting is to learn to play them straight. You see what happens is after i have swept them for four they bowl a fast one straight on my feet and me being kind of unsure/less-confident just block it even though i expected the quicker ball from spinner! Thats why i wanna improve my feet work
--&gt; In english conditions, ball hardly turns so the risk of getting out because of the turn is minimal.

End of the 7th over, my team is struggling at 24-4 after being put in, a still damp outfield slowing the ball along the ground, the batsmen are effectively encouraged to hit in the air. Their tidy opening bowler begins his 4th over with a couple of dots, then 3rd ball our number 5 dances down the pitch and middles a straight drive. 

Now even as a young(ish) player I'm not sure if I could have got out of the way, but given the bowler was in his 70s, it was perhaps unsuprising that he could not. All he could do was turn his head slightly before the ball crashed into his temple. Even from my position on the boundary I could hear an almighty crack as it happened, before he crumpled in a heap. I initially thought it had hit him high on the chest, but everyone shouting to call an ambulance quickly clarified the severity of the impact.

Five minutes later they arrive and are concerned because one of his pupils is unresponsive, which I gathered was bad and could imply brain damage, they decided he needed to be airlifted to hospital.

Another ten minutes later, we have a helicopter landing in the middle of the ground (not on the square though!), he's treated in the Ambulance for a while, then whisked away in the helicopter.

We were told that while in the ambulance his pupils had returned to normal, which was positive, and he'd been induced into a coma to stabilise him.

The game was abandoned, unsuprisingly. 

Returning home I have just received an update that he's being operated on to remove pressure on his brain, but he has improved and will likely recover, but the feeling while he was laying on the square, no one sure if he would be ok. 

Certainly puts some perspective into life, and the hidden dangers of the sport. Sorry if no one cares about this, I'm venting as much as storytelling!",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,wales,True,t3_tv2ua,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/tv2ua/today_i_wondered_if_id_seen_someone_die/,

I can understand that a team doesn't want to bat forever, and wants to make sure that they've got enough time to get the other team out, but why when they get to a score they are happy with do they declare rather than simply pretending it's the last couple of overs of a 20-20 match and trying to hit everything out of the ground, or even running on just about every ball? 

You'd probably still be out in the next few overs, or even next few balls, so you wouldn't need to worry about running out of time, but even if you just picked up a handful of extra runs it could make the difference between being able to force a follow on or not for example.",,False,self,t5_2qhe0,False,,,True,t3_1k5dyj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1k5dyj/why_do_teams_declare_rather_than_just_really/,

1349742453.0,26,self.Cricket,1162kh,Sri Lanka's limited overs record over the last 12 years and the Windies' two unlikely triumphs,ehloelle,28,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cricket/comments/1162kh/sri_lankas_limited_overs_record_over_the_last_12/,"Every Sri Lankan who watched last Sunday's final would have been thinking that their team must be paying for sins of a past life. In their head, they must have reasoned that losing 4 on the trot was far too many and surely would not occur. Alas, but to the great delight of this jovial set of calypso islanders, Sri Lanka's dream was not realised. 

Since their 1996 World Cup victory, Sri Lanka have acquired a reputation as a lively, exciting and combative limited overs side, capable of competing on an even keel with the very best. In the last 12 years, they have qualified for 17 finals and 2 semifinals. The appearances are as follows:


1) Asia Cup  2000 Final (vs. Pakistan) Host: BAN

2) Singer Triangular 2000 Winner (vs South Africa) Host: SRI

3) ARY Gold Cup 2001 Winner (vs. Pakistan) Host: UAE

4) Morocco Cup 2002 Winner (vs. South Africa) Host: MOROCCO

5) Champions Trophy  2002 Shared Winner(vs India) Host: SRI

6) World Cup  2003 Semi (vs. Australia) Host: SA

7) Asia Cup  2004 Winner (vs. India) Host: SRI

8) Paktel Cup 2004 Winner (vs. Pakistan) Host: PAK

9) Indian Oil Cup 2005 Winner (vs. India) Host: SRI

10)VB Series 2006 Final (vs. Australia) Host: AUS 

11)World Cup  2007 Final (vs. Australia) Host: WI

12)Asia Cup  2008 Winner (vs. India) Host: PAK

13)T20 World Cup 2009 Final (vs. Pakistan) Host: ENG

14)Idea Cup 2010 Winner (vs. India) Host: BAN 

15)T20 World Cup 2010 Semi (vs. England) Host: WI

16)Asia Cup  2010 Final (vs. India) Host: SRI

17)World Cup  2011 Final (vs. India) Host: IND/SRI/BAN

18)CB Series  2012 Final (vs. Australia) Host: AUS

19)T20 World Cup 2012 Final (vs. AUS/WI) Host: SRI

Winners: 8 Runners-up: 9 Semi-Finalist: 2

What can be deduced is that a lot of these tournaments have been held in Asia where Sri Lanka of course thrive and where tournament organisers would hope that Sri Lankan fans would turn up in their numbers. However, exceptional performances in challenging conditions like in South Africa in 2003, England in 2009 and Australia in 2012 must not be ignored. 

The failure to clear the last hurdle has created an almost psychological block for most Sri Lankan fans. However, the consistency in reaching 4 finals in 4 years must be applauded and Sri Lankan fans will come to appreciate it once the heartache soothes with time. 

**Windies' two unlikely triumphs**

At exactly the halfway stage of the West Indian innings, you would not have found too many punters lining up at the betting shops and backing the men in maroon. 32-2, 10 overs read the score card. Mathews, Kulesekera and Mendis were asphyxiating an explosive lineup and were controlling the game. The ensuing fireworks from Samuels &amp; co, then, wrestled the game back. It was a comeback that didn't look likely but even at the innings break, Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews opined that the Windies' were 20 runs short. He wasn't fooling anyone, for even Mahela's face etched worry. 

The momentum was swinging the way of the Caribbean and the dismissal of Dilshan stifled Sri Lanka's run chase. The West Indies playing in a cauldron of cacophonous, raucous Sri Lankan supporters silenced them at regular intervals. The dark horse had ran the race of her life and left the men in blue to assume bridesmaid duties once more. It was a fine feat and one that reminded me of another great West Indies escape act. 

The 2004 Champions Trophy final too, was played between the host nation and the West Indies. After having restricted England to a modest 217 (courtesy of a Trescothick masterclass 104), the Windies themselves were reduced to 147-8. They were staring down the abyss but somehow stitched together an unlikely 71 run partnership between Courtney Browne (34) and Ian Bradshaw (35). (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mz-4rcb8ko8) The miracle was complete with 7 balls to spare. The old adage 'stealing victory from the jaws of defeat' couldn't be more appropriate and though the manner of victory wasn't as similar as in 2004, one can sense that the situations have parallels. On both occasions, the Windies' had to play against the host nation and had to outmatch a very worthy opponent.
