But the protest is not only about the raise at all. It's about the precarious conditions of the public transport.
It's about the goverment spending recklessly for the world cup, for the lack of public health and education for everyone.
The police is not well trained to deal with this, they are poorly trained and in most states they are under-equipped.

We also have one of the most corrupt governments in the world. Where known politicians have stolen and caught red-handed and still roam free, of worse, still retain their positions in the government.


The media call the protesters ""thugs"" and ""vandals"". I just say they are fed up.

The minimum wage is 750 reais/month in Brazil. It's estimated that with the present price to 3,20 reais would make a minimum wage worker spend up to 200 reais a month with transportation just to work.
That means more than 20% of a worker's salary goes into transportation. What about food? What if he has kids? The potest is not about 10 cents. It's  about injustice. About a reckless government and widespread corruption. About the violence in our streets. About the bullshit we have to put up with everyday.

BRILLIANT, Oh.

An officer and a Brilliant man are both hospitalized after getting hit by a car Christmas night.

On Wednesday night, Barry Starcher, of Brilliant, told Natalie Herbick  his side of the story.

  Starcher faced a judge Wednesday on charges connected to the investigation, but is now out of jail on house arrest. While police have released their version of events, Starcher said his side deserves to be heard.  He said both he and his boyfriend, James Coil, feared for their lives. 

""Christmas was a bad day that day. We were taking a walk to take a breather,"" Starcher said.

Just after 10 p.m. on Christmas night, Starcher said he and Coil, were approached by an officer along a Brilliant roadway

""He asked, 'What's going on?' and we said, 'Nothing.' He said, 'What are you doing?' We said, 'Nothing,'"" Starcher said.
""He said, 'Well, what's your name?' And I said, 'I'm not sure if I should give you that. Why do you want it?' And that's when he jumped out of the car.""

Starcher said the officer started swearing and got in their faces.

Wells Township police said OfficerJ.J. Kamerer only had intentions of lending a helping hand but sensed confrontation and merely wanted identification. Police said Coil threw a prescription bottle at the officer's face.

""He didn't throw the pill bottle at him,"" Starcher said. ""He handed him the pill bottle and said, 'This is the only thing I have that has my name on it.""""

At that point, Starcher admitted, things escalated.

""Jimmy started to mouth off. I mouthed off a little,"" Starcher said. ""I'm guilty of mouthing off.""

Police said Kamerer chased the men on Third Street in Brilliant. Starcher said he never ran, but at one point backed away in fear.  He said that after he was sprayed with mace, he couldn't see much but remembered hearing what happened next.

""I heard the officer running into the road screaming, and I see the officer being pushed by the car,"" Starcher said.
""And then all of a sudden the car stopped and the officer flies across the road, and when the car backs up, there's Jimmy laying in the road.""

Coil is in critical condition in a Pittsburgh hospital. Starcher said neither of them wanted to start any problems, and he is just shocked it came to this.

""He's never done anything to anyone,"" Starcher said as he fought back tears. ""He's never done anything to anyone. He didn't deserve this.""

Starcher pleaded no contest in court and was found guilty of obstructing official business and failure to disclose one's personal information. He is set to be sentenced on Jan. 11.

Officer Kamerer is in Wheeling Hospital with a serious leg injury.  NEWS9 will make sure his side of the story is heard once he is ready to speak.

summary- Google: the elan school (this will basically open Pandora's box) 

This place only still exist because so many people believe that it doesn't or that it can't. I believe that the internet is our #1 tool for exposing these horrid blind spots for what they are. Help me Reddit! 

I was sent to a place called The Elan School in 1998 and I was only 16. The scary thing is that Elan is still open, kids aged 13-20 are there right now. Normal kids, many whom may have smoked a joint or two, or who swore at their parents. Of course there were also real criminals there, but they did not make up the majority.

The ""school"" accepted anyone and then held them as long as they possibly could depending on the age of the child. If you were sent at 14 (many were) you may have been looking at 3-4 years. This is because The Elan School collects $50,000 a year per child, either from the child's state, school, or parents. And, of course, money was the only motivation of the staff and directors. These were the people in charge of your ""progress"" in the program.

I could write for hours about it, instead I ask you to skim the following bullet points and to understand that I am telling the truth.

*   We were forced to participate in staff-organized fight clubs, none of which were fair, all were designed to humiliate one child who would be put up against at least 3 others. So even the children who ""followed the rules"" were forced to fight: in the name of ""good"". 

*   Children who tried to rebel or be free-thinking were thrown into an isolation room where they had to stay for months at a time, they had to sleep at night on a dirty mattress on the floor of the isolation room The mattress was brought to them at midnight and they were woken up around 7am.

*   We were all forced to perform in a ritual called a ""General Meeting"" where the entire house (60 or more boys and girls) screamed at one child who stood behind a broomstick. Many times they were forcibly held up by two other students so they would have to accept the punishment.

*   Education was considered a right, but those of us who earned the right were still robbed of an education. School was from 7pm-11pm: no homework, no test, no projects. Ex: math class consisted of grabbing a math book and handing the teacher at least one page of work.

*   The other 12 hours of the day consisted of constant conditioning and brainwashing. In the beginning you obviously rejected it, but then you would be ""dealt with"". You would not be able to rise through the ranks of the program to earn more 'rights' until you could prove yourself to be a good candidate for more brainwashing. Eventually it became your responsibility to begin indoctrinating the newer residents (basically you, six month earlier). You had Strength and Non-Strength. Non-Strength's were not allowed to talk, interact, or communicate in any way with other Non-Strengths. It took a minimum of 6 months to earn the title of ""Strength"". It took some kids years to earn ""Strength"". Some kids never did.

*   Elan made money based on the amount of time it took for you to graduate ""the program"". You had to have a minimum of 7 promotions before you were a candidate for ""graduation"". Each promotion took a minimum of 3 months, and 90% of the kids never made it past the 5th promotion. These kids had to wait until they turned 18 and could legally sign themselves out. Other kids stayed past their 18th birthday, which is a true testament to the effectiveness of the brainwashing, I remember one dude was 23.

*   Your level of high-school had no reflection whatsoever on your ability to leave Elan. I was forced to do my senior year of high school twice, even though I was technically done after the first senior year.
 
*   The staff members were primarily former students who were hired by Elan after graduating from the program. Many arrived in BMW's and clearly made 6 figure incomes. None of them had degree's in psychology, education, social work, etc... Many of them never went to college at all.

*   All outgoing letters to parents were screened, many of us having to write many different drafts until they were accepted. All phone calls to our parents were monitored, we were allowed about 15 minutes a week and the person who monitored the call would have their hand hovering over the hang-up button as a constant reminder of our reality.

*   We were not allowed to write or receive letters until we earned the right (this could take 8 months or more). When someone found out where I was and wrote me, my unopened letters were ripped up in front of me as motivation to move up in the program.

I feel like I am beginning to write too much and I do not want to overwhelm anyone who made it this far. Because most of the bullet points honestly require further explanation to give the full impact of what Elan truly was.

The most important thing that anyone can do is to be aware of this place and make sure that nobody you know ever gets sent there for any reason. If you are a parent then do not send your child there. If you know someone who is there now then beg the parents to do more research.

The amount of suicides and tragic deaths of former Elan students is reason enough to take this post seriously.

I've gone through 5 different doctors, lost track of all the medications I've been put on, had 2 MRIs, 5 CT scans, and 1 surgery.  I basically require Excedrin to make life bearable and be able to function at work and home.  On my first (and, so far, only) vacation to Hawaii I spent 2 of the 5 days we had there laying on the couch with a cold cloth on my forehead.

In the midst of the last 10 years I've graduated from college, gotten married, and had a son who is now 10 months old.  Sometimes I just have to push through the blinding pain because he needs me.  I spent my honeymoon popping Excedrin so that I could enjoy the time with my new wife.

I've tried all sorts of alternative therapy, supplements, herbs, and investigated dietary causes.  Nothing stopped these headaches.

That all changed 2 weeks ago.

I was reading a random IAMA where someone was describing similar headaches and one commentor suggested that OP should make sure he's sleeping on his back.  For some reason that stuck in my head and I figured ""what the hell?  I've tried everything else."" I prefer to sleep on my stomach but I decided to switch to my back.

The effect was immediate.

I now haven't needed to take any Excedrin since that first night 2 weeks ago.  I no longer need to wonder if when I make plans I'm going to be able to follow through on them.  We're planning a cruise in January and I no longer wond if I'm going to really be able to enjoy it.

If you don't understand why I'm so happy about this imagine the worst headache you've ever had - now imagine that you get it every afternoon for 10 years nonstop and that no one can tell you why.  All of the doctors tell you that your test results are fine, and there's nothing wrong with you.  You live like this for 10 years.  Then one day you take the advice of a random stranger on the internet and everything's fixed in one simple stroke.

Thank you Reddit.

EDIT: I wish I could remember the original post.  I didn't bookmark it or anything and I do a LOT of Reddit lurking.

EDIT2: I made the front page?  I feel like I won something.  Also - holy crap this post exploded while I was asleep (on my back of course) last night.

EDIT3: A few people have pointed out that I probably wasn't having migraines.  I would have to agree - the only thing that I had in common with migraine sufferers was pain (no visual halo or anything), but that's what two neurologists and an ENT (ear, nose, throat) doctor told me so it's what I went with.

EDIT4: Holy cow - thanks for all of the positive comments everyone.  I've gotten some very interesting PMs and other responses from neurologists and other muscular specialists and it's made for some very interesting reading.  I can't believe all of the upvotes this post has gotten.  You guys are all fantastic.

We talked about plans for the next couple of days, the TV show she had gotten me into. But a feeling lingered. Something I've been wanting to say for literally weeks now. The holidays and work kept us both pretty busy and I was keen on making up excuses. I couldn't find the right time, or the right mood. Again, I thought as we finished our conversation by her car, it was going to pass by. 

""She's trying to go home, now's not the time."" The Brain said as it leaned back in his chair, chalking up another successful day.

""Tell her!"" The Heart appealed as he entered the control room.

""Wait another day or so. Now's not the right time."" The Brain coolly replied not looking up from his log.

We kissed goodnight and as she waited for her car to warm up, I started making the walk back to my apartment, with the now all too familiar feeling of regret rising in my chest.

""Oh, no. Not again. You're going to tell her. NOW!"" The Heart demanded as it Falcon Punched The Brain out of his chair and seized the override on my motor control. I walked, then broke into a jog, back to her car, then slowed down again as to ""not appear to be a mugger,"" The Brain groaned from the floor of the control room. 
I knocked on the window.

**""Hey, so, I've had to tell you something for a few days now and its been killing me not to tell you, so, uh. Yeah. I love you.""**
She smiled, very genuinely, very sweetly. Like she always does.

""My work here is done,"" The Heart said as it sprang from the chair and took the turbolift back to its quarters.

The Brain, panicked and now back in the command chair, had to process damage control.
""Shields up! Red alert!""

**""...and you don't have to say anything back but I had to tell you because its literally been eating at me. So, uh yeah. Goodnight.""**

I briskly walked away before she could even roll up her window. I told her. And that was that. 
As I nearly rounded the corner to the back of my building, I heard a car door hastily close. I looked back. It was her, now in the middle of the lot. I started to walk back, but before I could take one step...

**""I love you, too!""**


She shouted, no, declared it, from across the parking lot, gave a wave and her smile and went back to her car and drove off.

This is all I can give him.,xebo,2563,1017,159,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/q5guh/an_unknown_man_died_this_is_all_i_can_give_him/,"This probably won't be seen, but it needs to be said. I've been carrying this for a while. I've never told anyone about this.

I once knew a great man. His name was Phil Pilalus. He used to be a millionaire during the ""dot com"" explosion in silicon valley. Among being a tremendously accomplished entrepreneur, he was a master salesman, and a prodigy in the field of civil service. 

He didn't only advocate human rights, he fought for them with a fervor that I have hardly known. If you were/are a foster child, a disenfranchised child, or a ward of the state, Phil Pilalus pioneered the fight for your rights. He drafted, by hand, many documents that guarantee your safety.

The ""dot com"" bubble burst, and Phil lost everything. He spent his time after that volunteering for local community service efforts. ""Sandwiches on Sundays"" was one among many local programs he donated his time to. To make ends meet, Phil rented a room out to people who he thought needed a hand. 

Two years ago I moved out to Mountain View, CA for a coop with NASA, while I finished going to junior college. I had no support structure within a two-state-radius. No health insurance for interns, and I couldn't afford a car let alone health coverage. Phil decided that I could use some help, so he rented me a room. 

We spent the next 6 months getting to know each other. Phil and I were both somewhat off the ""beaten path"". Neither of us had medical coverage, and neither of us were very stable, economically. During our talks, Phil would often express how it was hard for him to get a job now a days, since the business world didn't have need for an aging salesman. He would talk about how costly medical coverage is, and how he would have to contact the drug manufacturers directly to be supplied with his medication. He would talk about how sometimes he would meet doctors at the events he volunteered for, and they would give him the occasional free checkup. More than anything, Phil would talk about how he wasn't beaten yet. He was going to make his comeback. He would say that it was only a matter of time until he would be a millionaire again, and I completely believed him.

One night I woke up to a gentle tapping on my wall at about 3:00 am. I trace it back to Phil's room. I open his door, and see him sitting on the side of his bed in his boxers. He's struggling to say something, but I can't make it out since he's having a lot of trouble breathing. I shout that I'm going to call 9-1-1, and I rush to the living room to do so. The operator tells me that an ambulance is on its way as I jog back into Phil's room. When I enter, I see Phil unconscious, collapsed face up on his bed. He's not breathing. The operator walks me through the CPR process until the EMT's arrive. 4 hours later, they wheeled him out in a body bag. 

Phil Pilalus died that night because of heart complications that arose from mixing his medications improperly. He never got to make his comeback. He had accomplished so much, and helped so many people, and he died alone in a shitty fucking apartment. They just let him die.

I'm sorry if this wasn't the most eloquent way of telling this story. Phil Pilalus deserves so much more than this. It's all I can give him. I'm so sorry Phil.

I'm glad you bothered to say something to me outside the cafe, I actually thought you were just going to ask me for a smoke. In the end, I gave you one anyway, so I guess it worked out. 

I feel like we'd make good friends if you stuck around, but I doubt I'll forget you or this story for a long while. You said a lot of stuff that I needed to hear tonight, stuff I knew but never let sink in quite like the way it did hearing it from you. I know it sounds cheesy or whatever but, the way the conversation unfolded, the approach, everything was beautifully executed. I felt comfortable talking to a complete stranger about things I hardly even bring up with friends and I know it sounds silly, its weird being sincere typing this up when I doubt you'll ever see it. 

On the car ride down, you said how you always introduce yourself to people who seem interesting when you see them, otherwise you'll end up kicking yourself for it if you dont. It makes perfect sense in your case, you're at the mercy of strangers most of the time unless you know someone from the city you're in, like you said, but you said it so nonchalantly, without pretense or in a manner of lecture and it affected me more than any other time I had read or heard that exact line. Even if all your stories were bullshit, when you said that I knew you meant it and I haven't stopped thinking about it since I dropped you off.

Zach and I ended up going to Essex for a minute, the bar I told you about that I thought you'd like with the pool table. Then we went over to this party downtown, talked to some old love interests, without pretense or approach and it turned out better than I would have ever expected. I think he took away a lot from meeting you too, we had a legit conversation about band stuff, our friendship, personal stuff - shit we've never talked about before.

Anyway, I hope the bus ride doesn't suck and the tracking class you're going to turns out well. I hope you continue to talk to those interesting people you find where ever you go and have good memories of them. If you're ever back in Buffalo again, hit us up and we'll go play pool.

1341590273.0,1420,self.self,w4tbe,"With the Olympics coming up, there are tons of commercials asking viewers to donate to the US Olympic Committee, but PLEASE DON’T.  Here’s why:",nathancrumpton,1918,498,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/w4tbe/with_the_olympics_coming_up_there_are_tons_of/,"First off, I need to say that few people believe in the Olympic spirit more than I do.  The Olympic Games are, in my opinion, the single greatest event to foster global peace and international accord that mankind has ever created.  And other than the largely ineffectual and intermittently corrupt United Nations, nothing brings together more people from more countries with a more diverse background than the Olympic Games. On a personal level, participating in the Olympic Games is one of the premiere goals in my life.  In 2008, capping a 9 year track &amp; field career, I tried to qualify for the US Olympic Trials in the triple jump, but competing with chronic injury had me fall 15 inches short of the first trials standard.  I’ve since switched to winter sports, and compete as an [Olympic Development Bobsled &amp; Skeleton athlete](https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105421990294348679176/albums/5761166061455094241). So please don’t knock me for hating on the Olympics; few people have put as much time, effort, and sacrifice towards that very endeavor as I have.

My chief complaint is with the United States Olympic Committee.  It does not take adequate care of its athletes when compared to most other first-world nations.  The sad irony is that the USOC is one of the richest national Olympic Committees in the world, if not THE richest, and yet its athletes are some of the poorest and least supported.  

In total, less than 10% of the USOC’s funds are earmarked for directly supporting the athletes.  In 2002 Salt Lake City it was 7% of funds, and in 2004 Athens it was 6.7%.  And in 2007 - a non-Olympic year when revenues are typically lower - 9.5% was allocated to athletes. And of the portion that the USOC allocates to National Governing Bodies, the organizations that oversee individual sports, only 3% of funds go directly toward supporting athletes.  (As 501 non-profits, the USOC and NGBs must have publicly available 990 IRS forms, so more recent figures are out there if someone wants to dig up.  ([Read more about financial side of Olympic Endeavors](http://usatelitetrack.org/dhac/?page_id=29)) 

Those numbers are abysmal.  Imagine another NGO or a charity that only directed 3%-10% of its funds toward direct aid.  (For reference the American Institute for Philanthropy sets 60% as a minimum and 75% as the preferred amount for direct support.)  At best the USOC would be lampooned as a joke in the industry, and at worst they’d be accused of a blatant money grubbing scam.  In any other area of philanthropy, people would stop donating immediately.

And yet the USOC gets away with it because it is the only officially sanctioned institution (other than individual athletes and their funds, which can’t compete with the budget and manpower of the USOC) to represent the United States at the Olympics.  In effect, the USOC is a legal non-profit monopoly that is empowered by the veils of patriotism and Olympic spirit. 

They further justify their dearth of support for athletes by claiming that athletes receive adequate financial aid from private enterprises and through lucrative endorsement contracts.  That’s a wild fantasy for most athletes.  For every millionaire Shaun White or Lindsey Vonn, there are scores upon scores of unknown nobodies who work just as hard and who struggle heroically to make ends meet, as NBC will surely remind you during their coverage. Just imagine the challenge of convincing an employer to hire you when you can only commit half of your year to the job because the other half of the year you’re in competition.  That generally only leaves low-paying hourly wage jobs without any benefits.  (Benefits and/or salaries that if you lived in many other countries, their Olympic Committee would provide.)  That brings up the challenge of trying to convince a health insurance company to provide you with coverage.  And even if you’re a paragon of health and phsyical vigor, that’s not an easy sell when you’re engaged in activities such as ski jumping, snowboarding, or sliding down a chute of serpentine ice at over 70mph/112kph, and where [serious injury is always a risk](http://www.sportsnet.ca/magazine/2012/05/04/sportsnet_magazine_bobsled_accident_zwelling/). Most insurance companies view that as a terrible business proposition, and will find any way to either deny coverage or charge a ridiculous premium.  

As a result of this lack of USOC support, I’m working three jobs (one full time office job for an hourly wage with no benefits, and then two freelance circuits) and I’m nowhere near saving enough money to be able to compete full time next season.  And on top of that I’m supposed to dedicate 2 to 4 hours each day to training.  I do have an individual athlete training fund that allows sponsors to make tax-deductible donations to support me, but I’ve yet to convince anyone that it’s a worthwhile cause (and with all the sick, starving, and less fortunate people in the world who could be better served by charitable donations, I completely understand the reticence to support an Olympic Development Athlete).  That financial gap is where the USOC should really be stepping up to help support its athletes, but it doesn’t.  I’m seriously thinking about taking to the streets in my spare time and begging for cash.  

And yet the USOC rakes in well over $100 million a year.  In non-Olympic years, it will haul in ~$140-150 million ($147 million in 2007), and during Olympic years that number swells profusely.  This year’s broadcast rights alone will likely breach $120 million, and corporate sponsorship will likely bring in another $60-80 million.  And they’re still asking individual viewers through NBC commercials and web campaigns to donate to the USOC on top of that.   

So where is all that money going?  

Not towards athlete performance bonuses apparently: a US athlete who brings home the gold medal in his or her event will receive just $25,000 from the USOC.  By comparison, a Russian athlete who brought home the gold in Beijing earned $100,000 from their Olympic committee.  Japan also gave fourfold what a US athlete earned.  China awarded their gold medal athletes $131,000, Uzbekistan &amp; Italy ~$200,000, Kazakhstan $250,000, UAE $272,000, Iran &amp; Greece $290,000, Thailand and Malaysia ~$300,000, Philippines $340,000, and Singapore [topped the list](http://100kjob.info/2008/08/12/how-much-does-an-olympic-gold-medal-bring-you/) with $708,800, or over 28 times what a US athlete earned for a gold medal.  

Rather, over 60% of their budget goes towards “administrative expenses,” which includes over $35 million in salaries, and included COO &amp; former CEO salaries of over $600,000 per year.   In 2008, 8 USOC officials made more than $300,000 per year, and at least 20 made over $200,000 per year.  Of the remaining ~40%, most of that is earmarked for the NGBs (eg. The Speedskating Association, USA Track &amp; Field, US Bobsled &amp; Skeleton Federation, and all the other individual sports), and within that remaining ~40%, only ~3% goes directly toward athlete support.  That’s a whole lot of money getting whittled away through administrative and bureaucratic inefficiencies, as well as outright greed masquerading as patriotism.  In the meantime, I’m going to go hit the gym and brainstorm some strategies for street peddling.  

**TL;DR: Please do not donate to the US Olympic Committee; they’re one of the richest Olympic Committees in the world, yet their athletes are among the poorest of any developed country.  If you want to support the Olympic Spirit, sponsor an individual athlete.**

I was briefly awake and heard a odd noise outside, and only decided to look out my window because I know the bloke across from me has had his car stolen once before about a year or two back.

From looking, I saw a normal looking guy come out of my driveway, and go down next doors, so I thought ""Oh maybe he's putting stuff in the letterbox"".

I stayed watching him out of curiosity and then when he crossed the alley between my neighbour and their neighbour, I saw he was going up to the cars, seeing if they were unlocked and moving on. Out of the 3 cars my neighbour's neighbour had...1 was unlocked, so he slowly got in, quietly closed the door, turned the interior light on and started looking about.

Now my first instinct here wasn't great. Instead of calling the police, I grabbed my phone and tried to film it. It's far too dark to see anything, but I tried anyway. In hindsight I should've actually got out of bed and grabbed my proper camera which has nightvision and a good zoom. Anyway, after about 30 seconds, I went to wake up my dad thinking we could go out and stop him/ward him off, which we've done once in the past when our neighbour was getting burgled and they called us for help while she waited for police. It was then I got the much more appropriate advice to actually phone the police. 

So I phoned them, and during this time he had moved onto the next available car 3 door's from me, which also was unlocked (seriously people, lock your car, it's not that hard) and he started to search that one. Now because it was a dead night, while I was still on the phone to the operator describing what I could see, over the next 20 seconds 4 police cars turned up. No sirens or lights, with 2 approaching from each end of the road. The guy noticed and tried to leg it into a garden, but let's be real, he had 8 police officers after him and they caught him pretty quick. Then a police van turned up to take him and I had to give a statement to a police woman at 5:15am. That itself took just over half an hour then I went back to bed.

So, at my last job, I was hired as a dishwasher, I worked there for four years, with my one goal being to become a bartender (the highest paying, non-management position one could hold with the company). Due to politics, the owner's dislike of me, and the in general silly ways the place was run, I never made it, instead I was made a cook, and a bar-back, but was never given the opportunity to bar tend.

Fast forward.

I was fired from the last job by the chef, who hated the fact that I wanted to be a bartender. In a bit of poetic justice, he was fired shortly after, for being horrible at his job.

Since then, I spent a little time on unemployment, then found a job at an awesome restaurant/brewery. I was hired on the spot as a busser (no huge accomplishment), with the stipulation that I would become a server in the near future. Within a few weeks I started serving.

Long story short, for the last few months I have been serving, and after working really hard, today was my first bar tending shift, and it went great.

I know in the grand scheme of things this isn't any great accomplishment, but for me it's pretty nice to see my hard work paying off, and to finally get some acknowledgment of my ambition.

When I walked in, the place was torn apart, and I realized that the reason my key was missing is because someone stole it (I must have lost it close to home), and robbed us while we were both at work.  Here are a few pics (this was how it was initially, I turned this light off and the other one on for the other pics so you could see the room.  Also sorry for the quality, took the pics with my phone.)

There doesn’t seem to be too much stolen, except for the Wii, my DVDs, and PS2 and Wii games.  It seems like the main goal was destruction, with a quick sweep of electronics.  Oddly they left all the plugs for the Wii though, so I’m assuming they’re just looking to pawn it (left cabinet had the DVDs, right had all the games (also note they left the VHS tapes…dicks.))

The kitchen is a mess, but I can’t find anything missing, looks like they thought we’d hide our valuables in there for some reason or have expensive china.  Not finding anything, those fucks knocked food off the shelves too, which isn’t pictured.

I guess these fucking criminals are dumb, because when I went upstairs my laptop was still there (I actually kind of were hoping they'd nab it so I could use Prey). It also looked like my housemate's stuff had been rifled through (well, I at least noticed his chair was knocked over), but his PC was still there, which was mildly comforting.

After a quick debate of whether to tell my housemate or the cops first, assessing damage, and adrenaline pumping 100%, I decided to call my housemate first to tell him about it and figure out what we're going to do.  After explaining what happened and telling him we need to change locks since someone has my keys, he said he had $500 cash in an envelope on his desk that he was going to send home, and wanted me to check it out.  So I go up and find the envelope on his desk, but it’s empty.  I tell him that and I’m still trying to get my head on straight, and about 30 seconds later I saw this on his desk under the envelope.

http://i.imgur.com/PQ1XKh.jpg

I have concluded since this prank that my housemate is the best worst roommate ever.  Because of him I was 20 minutes late to work, had to dick around d.c. for an hour to get his key, thought we got robbed, almost called the cops over non-missing items, and probably almost died of a heart attack from how hard my heart was pumping.  As he puts it, I got J. Walter Weatherman'd.

EDIT:  Burglarized would be the correct term, not robbed.  Thanks bg785 for pointing that out.

EDIT #2:  Holy crap!  I didn't think this would get this big!

EDIT #3:  For everyone who says I had it coming (and that my roommate is awesome), you're right.  For those who say I should get revenge, don't worry, I will.  However I will only do it when he needs to learn a lesson, and don't worry I'm already scheming...

1337910659.0,1302,self.self,u3s38,I had to attend a Unemployment Seminar today to keep my unemployment benefits. I really need to vent due to the advice given. It was horrible.,Athrowawayfortoday,1765,463,363,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/u3s38/i_had_to_attend_a_unemployment_seminar_today_to/,"The first thing I need to vent about is the fact that the State Worker told me that the reason I needed to attend the seminar was because my resume indicated I was in a ""dying field"".  

I have an electronics degree, I work on computers, robots, pneumatics, hydraulics, I can code in multiple programming languages, I can write ladder logic code, I work with PLCs and have worked with the latest automated equipment and the oldest equipment.  Relay logic and good old troubleshooting is part of my knowledge. Not to mention the mechanical knowledge I have. The last job I held was with a green, recycling company on machines that required field repair of the electronics inside machines inside retail environments.  How is this a ""dying field?"".  

The first woman spoke.  She didn't really speak, she read her PowerPoint presentation to us word for word.  She babbled on for a bit about how to do important things like take a shower before an interview, wear deodorant and to dress accordingly.  While I am sure there may be people that don't know that, I am pretty sure that the older crowd in the room was quite aware of this.  I would say the youngest person in the room was 30.

The second woman started talking. For some reason she was going on and on about her skydiving hobby.  *In a room full of people in danger of losing their homes and not sure how they're going to keep their electricity on,* she continued to tell us about how her daughter and herself go skydiving all the time.  I don't skydive, but I can't assume it's cheap, especially with fuel costs.  Was this really necessary?  You could see everyone in the room just sitting in awe as this woman continued on about personal skydiving stories in different locations throughout the United States.

She then told us that our best option was to join the military.  She told us this after a woman told her that she worked for the same company for 30+ years and really only had one skill.  The woman that told her this was in her 50's. Now I am not against joining the military. Was this really the best advice she could give us?  She then went on to tell us about how her daughter was joining the military and babbled about skydiving some more.

She then told a room full of people how hard she has it because she has to drive 45 minutes to work.  *She's working for a state agency, gets state benefits and a state pension* but evidently a 45 minute drive is really tough when talking to a room full of unemployed people.  The people in the room actually got upset with her and started making remarks about how she was just ruining their morale.  It got personal and she couldn't figure out why.  Probably because you just sat here for 20 minutes telling us about skydiving vacations and you're complaining about a 45 minute ride into work.  Someone actually said ""Why not just skydive to work?""

She then bragged about how great our state's unemployment site is.  This is the site that crashes randomly, is horribly designed, is very hard for someone that isn't computer literate to navigate and isn't really something to brag about. It's actually easier to use Google to search it than it is to use the search function on the site.  I felt like she was patting herself on the back.

What made the whole situation worse, that while she was using the site, the Windows computer kept throwing up the ""Your firewall is turned off"" bubble and she wasn't sure how to get rid of it.  *This was the person that was supposed to be teaching us how to use the computer*.  During her ENTIRE PowerPoint presentation that bubble just stayed there, she didn't know to click the [X] and make it go away.  She mumbled and panicked and just left it there.  It kept minimizing her presentation, so she finally left in minimized and went on with the presentation.

Finally a third woman came up to speak to us about how to interview. She went on to tell us that we should turn down jobs if we don't think we're a right fit. *If you openly admit to turning down a job, you lose your unemployment benefits.*  She then said that you may not want to take a job that doesn't have room for growth. ""Like working for the state, *we haven't had a raise in over two years.""*  This woman was complaining to a room full of unemployed people that she hadn't had a raise in two years. *Really?* An older woman just sat here and told us she may lose her house, and your upset because you haven't received a raise in two years?

Finally it came to the point where we were allowed to ask questions.  Now another reason I am confused about why I was selected is because I have a full job services program available to me through the school I attended. I talk to a job counselor two or three times a week at my school.

I decided to ask the same questions that I asked the job counselor at school to see what the State Worker's response would be.  *All three questions were answered with ""I don't know, you'll have to ask someone else.""  When I asked someone else, I was told ""I don't know, you'll have to ask someone else"".  (The three questions would reveal my identity, i don't feel safe doing that, I don't want to lose my benefits)  The three questions I asked were quickly and easily answered by my school job counselor, I am already taking action to fix the situation. I just wanted to hear their responses.  *There were none.*

Finally, at the end of the seminar, we were required to review the list of jobs we had applied for.  The state requires us to apply for at least two jobs a week (I usually send out 5-10 resumes a week along with my job counselor actively searching for work for me).  The list I had was incomplete, I forgot to print it out before I left, so I quickly jotted down some of the jobs I remember sending a resume to.

I said to the woman ""I input this information every week when i file online, don't you guys have a database"" to which she responded ""We don't have access to it"".  **Then why am I filling out all that information if you're not going to use it???**.

I then explained that a lot of the jobs I send a resume to are through a jobsearch site that I have an account with, and a lot of the jobs appear as ""Company Confidential"". There is no contact information, I just send them a resume through the site and kind of hope for a phone call. 

She snapped at me and told me I was wrong, all companies list their name when they're hiring.  **NO! They DO NOT!  They're hiring confidentially because the probably don't want their competition to know they are hiring**.  These people had no clue how a jobsearch site works. They had no clue you could have accounts and that you don't need to send a resume through an e-mail address. You can just hit ""apply"" and fill out a quick form and your resume gets attached.  The only reason you know to apply is because of the title of the position!

I chatted with the second woman who talked for a few minutes. She asked how old I was, I told her and she responded with ""Have you thought about joining the military?"".  I am outside of the joining the military age, not to mention my dependents.  I told her I was thinking about going back to school to obtain my bachelors, since I work in a STEM field. She replied with ""Oh, college isn't all it's cracked up to be.""  *Really?* ever try to advance in a technology/engineering field *without* a college degree?  I have, the degree made all the difference in the world, it's just an associates, I can only imagine a bachelors would help even more. My salary increased substantially with just my associates.

She then told me that unemployment has a budget for the number of people that can attend this course and get help, I should feel honored to be there.  **This made me furious**.  I told her outright that I can go to my school any time, get advice from a job counselor about my resume, my attire, interviewing and use better equipment than what is available here if necessary.  I can also sit in on any of the courses I took just as a refresher. *Why have you wasted a space on making me attend this?* There are probably people who need this resource more than me. She basically GIGGLED and shrugged her shoulders at me and said ""You're in a dying field!"".  **Electronics, engineering and technology is not a dying field**

The youngest person in the room was right around 30 in my opinion, some were around 35-40, most were 50+. These are people that have been in a field for a long time.  They were getting horrible advice from these state workers. I almost feel like writing a letter to the state's unemployment director, unfortunately it would probably result in the termination of my benefits.

I know why I am unemployable at the moment, I am in the process of fixing it. I just needed to vent because the advice given to these people was horrible and these privileged state workers should be ashamed of themselves.  I usually do my best to stay neutral about the stereotype, but these people were living up to it.  It took everything in my power not to start screaming at them.

tl;dr: Went to unemployment seminar, watched as horrible advice was given. Enraged that they consider themselves ""helpful"".

Not a big deal, thank goodness, arthroscopy is an amazing thing. 

But she still ended up in pain and sore and unable to climb stairs. So we pulled out the fold-up couch in the living room and set it up for her to recuperate there for a few days. 

There were a couple of little problems, notably a nasty air leak from one window sill in the living room - it's really cold here. Plus she needed some prescription pain meds. And the brace they gave her for her foot was junk, and she needed something more substantial. 

I also should mention that she is a terrible patient, constantly in motion in life and very cranky about the prospect of spending a week off her feet. 

To top it all off, our clothes dryer broke down, so I decided to rig a clothesline in the basement for the time being. 

I go to the drug store to attend to all of these problems. While I'm waiting for the pain pills to be made ready I collect stuff to meet my other needs. And hey, there's a great deal on petroleum jelly, just the thing for those rough winter elbows. 

At last they call my name over the loudspeaker. The pharmacist, a woman I know reasonably well, asks if this is a new prescription, and I say yes. She goes over the dosing, etc. Then she says, ""You know, these are likely to make your wife very drowsy.""

Thinking of my wife's type-A personality and her difficulty lying still to recuperate I say, ""Actuallly, I'm counting on that.""

The pharmacist doesn't smile. In fact she flashes me a look that could have killed a small child. I'm bewildered. I pay for everything and leave. 

Only when I get home do I realize what I had placed on the pharmacy counter while collecting the drowsy-making pills:

When I was young, like 2 or 3 years old, my mother used to take me to a playgroup type place. It was just a hall where parents and preschoolers would go to socialise. I'd show up a few times a week and I'd hang out in the back room where we weren't supposed to go with all the other rebel 3 year olds.

[See that pimp in the middle? That's me.](http://i.imgur.com/2kv2P.jpg?2238)


There was a girl there - the one on the left in that picture. She was really sweet. Whenever I went to playgroup, I'd try to impress her. With pick-up skills decades beyond my years, I'd chat her up all the time. I was never a 'cooties' kind of guy, so the lack of a fear of girls was a huge pick-up advantage at 3 years old.

Anyway, this girl was special to me. No one was allowed to pick on her. Our parents became friends and our fathers used to tease us playfully about how we were boyfriend and girlfriend. We both denied it, but secretly, I think we both liked the idea.


[Okay, maybe her a little more than me...](http://i.imgur.com/lQwDH.jpg?5551)


But I was still totally into her! That was just me playing hard-to-get. I had my moments of weakness where I showed [how I really felt](http://i.imgur.com/zTAyM.jpg?3949).


At 5 years old, I asked her to marry me. As if you guys think she said no.

But time goes on and 5 year olds turn into 11 year olds. People move houses, and childhood romances are put down to games of 'doctor' and 'murder in the dark.

We still saw each other every now and then. About twice a year her family would go on holidays near my family, and we'd catch up.

[Something was always there](http://i.imgur.com/75BRp.jpg?4949)

[But we both kind of knew it couldn't last](http://i.imgur.com/yBWh9.jpg?2201)


On, we went into our teen years, [still seeing each other occasionally](http://i.imgur.com/vMbuC.jpg?1592), and always with the [same kind of feelings](http://i.imgur.com/qHx0v.jpg?5792). But again, at 15, nothing like that can work. I had girlfriends, she had boyfriends. How could it have worked?


Three years went by before I saw her again.

My sister was going to go on student exchange to Italy and her family decided that they were going to say goodbye before she left. I was convinced that nothing was going to be there between us. Three weeks prior, the messiest relationship imaginable had ended for me, and I was not doing good. I was still pretty excited to catch up with her, though.

The moment she walked through my front door, I was in love again. It was pathetic. 20 years old and I spent the whole night secretly hoping she would touch my hand. I was so taken by her that when she left, I felt compelled to send her a message telling her how I felt. I told her I was sorry if it was creepy, but I just thought she should know.

Her response: ""Wow. That was unexpected. I can't believe you've felt the same way that I have for all this time. I felt like I was making such an idiot of myself at your place, and you'd never want to see me again.""

Old tricks never fail and a little over a month later, we were dating.

[15 years after I asked her to marry me, we were together the way we always should have been. This is the kind of thing that everyone should get to have in their life.

(story in comments),savethecoffeecart,1652,441,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jfxnq/updatethis_couple_spent_their_life_savings_to_buy/,"I made a post about two weeks ago in /r/pics and the post reached the #1 spot on reddit. I wanted to give everyone here an update on the situation (I found that /r/self was more suitable for this than /r/pics)

Original Post here: ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1ihzm4/this_couple_spent_their_life_savings_to_buy_and/))

Story: ([link](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1ihzm4/this_couple_spent_their_life_savings_to_buy_and/cb4m95d))

Story(**tl;dr**): For people who didn't see the original post, the story was that a beloved coffee cart/kiosk at my school, Loyola Marymount University, was being forced out by Sodexo, the school caterer, and the administration. They wanted to replace the independently run ""mom and pop"" coffee cart with Coffee Bean Tea &amp; Leaf and they kept the couple in the dark about the decision until right before a renewal of their contract that had been organized months in advance. Students discovered this and were outraged and started a movement to save the cart.

**Update**: After the original reddit post, a greater amount of attention was thrown to the issue. It received official response from Sodexo on their Facebook page hours after the post ([link](https://www.facebook.com/sodexomain/posts/10151732782222728)) and LMU responded similarly the next day ([link](https://www.facebook.com/lmula/posts/10151770077341085)). The day after that LMU made a contract offer to the couple. The original offer was constructed in a way that would have made it very difficult for the couple to run their business (control over menu items and prices, no promise of a guaranteed location, etc.) and would have made it impossible to hold LMU or Sodexo accountable. But they fought these contract clauses and managed to get a contract they agreed with and LMU reported today that they officially signed a contract ([link](https://www.facebook.com/lmula/posts/10151796058061085?comment_id=394674849&amp;notif_t=like))! The attention that reddit brought to the issue helped it gain traction and support from people around the country. This eventually led to the signing of the contract and the continued operation of the couple's cart on campus. This experience has taught me that social media like reddit can be a platform for change, and just what the power of an organized community can be. 

Thank you to everyone who helped spread the news about the original post! It was the catalyst for a positive change in my community. 

Update(**tl;dr**): Forced by the outcry and attention the coffee cart story received, Loyola Marymount and Sodexo offered the couple a contract and it was signed today.

I wrapped all the gifts, being sure to pad the breakable ones carefully and put them all in a carry on; along with a homemade Christmas stocking that, after three weeks, I had just finished 3 days before, jewellery my fiancé had brought me back from his business trip in China... you know, all those things you REALLY don't want to lose so you keep them in your carry on.

We're able to spend Christmas at my parent's this year as we're based in Vegas for business (instead of our normal New Zealand... bit closer!), so our flight went from Vegas to DC, then DC to Philly. Boarding the plane in DC, we were told there was no more room for carry ons and we had to gate check our bag. So we did.

Get to Philly... no sign of two of our bags - our big suitcase we checked, that we SAW them take off the plane in Philly (its bright pink... hard to miss), and the bag we had gate checked not even an hour before.

Big pink bag was found an hour later, though no explanation was offered for its time spent MIA. The checked bag... they can't find any record of it in their system. They scanned the receipt we were given... and its like it never existed. 

Three days on, and no sign of it. I'm thinking someone at US Airways had sticky fingers. 

I just wanted to rant. :( Some of these gifts - and belongings - aren't easily replaceable - they were bought on trips to different cities we won't be going back to, special ordered, etc. I mean... you put things in your carry on for a reason. If you're made to gate check it, you'd think they'd take a little bit extra care... sigh.

I was very close to being a huge jerk.,sirberus,2749,1592,369,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/eqqi9/ಥ_ಥ_someone_cutting_onions_i_was_very_close_to/,"A couple years ago when I started getting serious about freelance tech support, I hit up local neighborhoods with fliers. As I walked away from one house, this old man and his wife came out of their house and started hollering for my attention. I went back and he had a computer where the power button broke. Not what I usually fix, but he was my first client so I took it and figured it out, repaired some springs and had it good as new.

So a bit of time has passed and I got a call from a familiar voice last Sunday. It was the old man again. The button on his VCR broke and he really wanted to get it fixed. I explained that it wasn't really something I do, but he insisted I could figure it out. I said I should be able to get to it this week, but I've been so busy I really didn't want to do it. From what he described, it would probably take a couple hours to fix and I had some higher-paying stuff in line for me to work on.

He called a couple times today, but I dodged the calls because I had so many other things I wanted to get done. I even tried to get my friend to act like my assistant and say I was sick or something. She was too shy... So I was forced to call him and tell him I'd go ahead and fix it. And I'm really glad I did. 

When I got to his house, I didn't really notice anything different. I started working on the button, but kept needing awkward tools that I didn't bring (like hot glue and toothpicks/long pointy things to get into hard to reach spots). Each time he left the livingroom to get them, I'd take a moment and relax. 

I started noticing a lot of pictures of him and his wife setup around the sofa. Then I noticed a handmade wall of photos of him and his wife. Next to the VCR was a stack of old videos that were stacked and ready to be watched. 

Then I realized that I hadn't seen his wife. 

He never outright told me, but I was able to pick up from conversation that she passed away last December. It was pretty much then that I realized he had surrounded the sofa with memories and photos of his wife and was planning on watching old homevideos of each other... But his VCR didn't work (and judging by his circa-1990 TV, he's not one to buy new stuff).

After a couple hours of work, a trip home for a hot glue gun, and some macgyvering, the button was fixed better than he said it ever was (it has a nice snap to it now). I mentioned to him that he was my first client and we laughed about him and his wife trying to get my attention, etc, etc. 

When he asked how much he owed me, I told him, ""I thought I told you, but I don't work during the holidays. This is just me helping out an old friend with a silly button.""

Merry Christmases were exchanged with a handshake, and I left with a new appreciation for not being a jerk and what the holidays are about.

I decide to go home from visiting my friends. On the way home, I pass a bar with an Open sign. On my side of town, I am aware of every bar in existence, yet I had never noticed this one. I prefer Icehouses because I can take my own bottle of whiskey inside and just buy cokes all night. I drive right by it the first time and figure what the hell, turn around, and park at this bar. 

I grab the bottle from my backseat, walk inside, glance around at the 12 people inside the bar, take my seat near the pool table, order a coke &amp; cup of ice, and pour up.

I drop a few quarters in the pool table and start playing against myself. I don't feel out of place or anything, just didn't want to look weird alone in a corner drinking. I get about 3 balls away from the 8-ball, I crouch down, take aim, pull the stick back, and feel two soft hands cover my eyes from behind.

I didn't even have to guess. I remembered her smell from 4 years ago, when I last saw her. It was Brooke. I dated that girl all through high school. Towards the end of senior year, she said she had decided to go to school out of town. I didn't have the money or grades to follow her, so we mutually agreed to discontinue our relationship. As time went on, I realized that our random texts &amp; calls were growing fewer and further between. I hadn't seen her since June 2008, hadn't heard her voice since January 2010, and I hadn't received any form of a message from her since September 2010. Yet there she was, standing behind me, trying to trick me as if I wouldn't instantly recognize her.

I put my hands on hers (again, so soft), and exclaim ""no shit!?"" I lift her hands up and twist her around, and I reacquainted with her eyes for the first time in 4 1/2 years. The same hazel sparkle I fell in love with. I pulled her in for a hug. Her hands reached into my unzipped jacket and her arms wrapped tightly around my torso. The hug was about 3 seconds, felt like 15 minutes, and I wanted it to last all night. 

The small talk quickly evolved into catching up each other on our lives for the last 3 years. I learned that we had both graduated on the same day (from different universities) last week, she starts working here in town next Wednesday, and that she is moving into her brand new apartment the following weekend. I caught her up on my happenings, and continued to ask what she was doing in a shack like this place.

She turns and points to a table of 3 people- 2 girls, one guy.

""I'm here with my two friends &lt;girl&gt; and &lt;girl&gt;, and my boyfriend!""

The second the B sound uttered from her lips, my heart fell into my stomach. Over the years I have gotten terribly skilled at hiding true emotion, so I quickly smiled and said ""Nice! Congrats! Well I'll let you get back to it-""

Before I can even finish saying ""Congrats on the job"" and take my bottle elsewhere, she interrupts:

""I'm joking! That's &lt;girl&gt;s boyfriend. Come drink with us?

I play it modest, when truthfully on the inside I'm doing a Victor Cruz touchdown salsa dance.

""Sure, let me see if I can pull off this comeback win and I'll head over there!""

I proceed to sink my last 4 shots, and move over to the other table. I introduce myself, explain my association with Brooke, and continue drinking and laughing with the group. 

About an hour goes by, the 2 girls step outside to smoke. The guy looks at me and gives me a look, then excuses himself claiming he has to ""Make a phone call"". What a guy.

Showtime. Me and Brooke, alone. I'm nervous. I glance over at the exact same time she glances at me. The shitty bar lighting manages to light her beautiful face up. She flashes a gorgeous smile and says ""What?""

It wasn't the alcohol (yet), it was my honest, nervous, sweaty-palmed self that blurted ""It's really good to see you.""

She agrees. ""I'm so glad! What are the odds?""

Long pause of about 5 seconds, genuinely just gazing in her eyes. She restarts, ""So what is the next big step for &lt;MyName&gt;?""

My response, as well as I can remember: ""Find a better job, become a homeowner, and fill it with a family the second I can afford it. With as much nonsense that can fit between all of that""


Brooke: I knew you would never change.

Me: Is that a bad thing?

Brooke: Nope, it's comforting. You've always been very set in your ways. 

Her friends return from smoking. I walk to the bar for another coke and a beer for her.

Bartender: Is that your lady?

Me: No sir, used to be

Even though he was just making small talk, saying that out loud made my throat close up. I was head over heels for this girl, and always got the same vibe from her. I'm feeling it again, why not at least mention it?

I return to the table, she thanks me for the beer, and we resume chatting amongst our table.

11pm rolls around and we're the only ones left in the bar. We spare the staff, close our tabs, and leave. We make our way to the exit, and Brooke points out how glad she is that she didn't drive. I mention that I am not drunk, just a bit tipsy, and I'll probably sit in my truck and sober up for about a half hour. 

She turns to her friends, mutters something, then says to me, ""Can you take me to my parents house?""

Me: Right now?

Brooke: Whenever. I just don't want to leave you alone and I'm not really ready to go home.

Me: Sounds good *cue touchdown dance*

We part ways with her group, get in my truck, heater, seat warmer, accompanied with my ""leaving the bar"" playlist. Yeah I have one of those, leave me alone.

Me: You don't have to wait around. I can run you home.

Her: No really, I'm good.

She puts on another smile, she puts her head back, relaxing. 

I went for it. I moved my hand over to hers. She closed her eyes and smiled again. With her eyes still closed she says ""Your hand is warm""

I pick her hand up, she opens her eyes, I lean in, she leans in, we touch foreheads.

Brooke: What are you thinking?

Me: I am thinking that I am pretty lucky running into you tonight.

Her(quietly): Me too.

I pick my head up, and go in for a kiss. Her lips touched mine for the first time in years, and I felt a spark throughout my body. She pulls back after about 5 seconds, smiles and says, ""What are we doing?""

Me: Whatever you want.

Her: Let's get me home. I want to make sure this isn't the alcohol.

I get on the road, and have her home 5 minutes later. My hand holding hers the whole way. I put it in park, and she leans all the way over to me and kisses me again. I hold on for 10 seconds, and release.

Her: Tonight was fun

Me: Yes it was. Can I have one more of those?

Smartest thing I've said all night. She leans in, puts one hand weaved into mine and the other behind my neck. We sit there in my truck making out for a solid 10 minutes. My shirt came off, her shirt came off. She kissed on my neck, I went for the bra. Oops.

We snapped out of it, smiled, laughed, and decided to resume another night. Just to double check that it wasn't the alcohol.

She leaned over one last time, kissed me on the cheek, and whispered into my ear ""Goodnight""

Me: Goodnight.

Some happiness on Christmas. Usually rare for me. Flying 10 feet off the ground today at work. So happy. 


TL;DR - Went to a random bar on a whim on Christmas night, my high school girlfriend ran into me, talked all night and re-kindled. Took her home, kissed her, and now I am falling hard for this girl all over again.

I've never been able to see out of my left eye, I had extremely bad kerotoconus (damaged cornea, which refracted light the wrong way). I could kind of see motion/blur, but that's about it. 19 months ago, I had a corneal transplant (awesome picture of my eye at that point here: http://imgur.com/WEBZM) to give me a dead person's eye (well, cornea).

Today, I had my final (barring checkups) appointment with my eye surgeon, and he took out the last two removable stitches from my transplanted cornea (a few will remain in the eye forever, or at least until they degrade). The vision will make final improvements over the next few weeks, but immediately after taking them out and putting on some glasses - I can see! For the first time in my life, I have (mostly) clear vision out of my left eye. It's incredible, I rang my wife in tears because I actually saw what my surgeons face looked like properly for the first time (my ""good"" eye isn't great either, that's next). Can't wait to see my daughter tonight, she's almost 5 and I've never really seen her face clearly. It's hard to explain - for my entire life, everything has had a ""fuzzy"" edge, but now things have defined edges. It's mind-blowing and weird - everything looks so strange because I'm seeing in 3D for the first time ever. This is what depth-perception looks like!

Around 2:15, these two 15 or 16 year old girls came in, ordered two blue-raspberry Italian ices, paid with a credit card, and left. About an hour later, some lady called saying her credit card had been stolen, and $3.00 had been charged to it at 2:15. She said she had called the police, but was calling us as well to warn us that the credit card company wasn't going to honor the transaction.

I quickly checked the register and the credit card machine, and verified that it had been her card used to pay for the two ices. I called her back and told her that I had found the transaction, and was certain I could give a description of the culprits to the police. 

An officer shows up maybe 10 minutes later, and I describe the girls to him. Two teenagers, lip and nose piercings, one had strawberry blonde hair, the other had brown hair. I added in, as an after thought, that they probably had blue tongues from the blue-raspberry Italian ices. The cop laughed it off, but one of my waitresses said, 

""No, really, those ices dye your tongue blue for a few hours."" 

The officer shrugged ""OK"" and jotted it down into his notes. 

""Thanks, if you have any more information please call us, our non-emergency line is listed in the phone book.""

Fast forward one hour. Two girls walk in, one of them is still carrying a blue Italian ice. They ask for a cup of water. I made eye contact with my waitress, and her expression was a combination of ""Yes, that's them."" and ""Wow, they're dumb."" I walked into the kitchen and called 911. 

""Hey, I'm Jacob from the Pizzeria, the two girls I described in relation to the credit card theft are walking out our back door right now...""

I follow them out. ""Can you tell me which way they went?"" 

""Yeah, they're in the parking lot walking towards the library.""

About 10 seconds later, a cop pulls up and confronts the girls. 15 minutes later I watch them get wheeled off to the station. 30 minutes later, I get a phone call from the officer to whom I gave the descriptions earlier, he asks me if I'll sign a written statement, I say sure, he comes into the pizzeria (I don't get off until 11pm), and I sign one.

""By the way,"" he says, ""It's in the police report. Their tongues. They were still blue."" 

He grins, ""The official report."" We had a good laugh on that one.

Anyway, it's easy to say and hindsight and all, but really? Returning to the scene of the crime? Blue-tongued?

This is not spam. I promise. This is just one grateful (and employed!) Redditor trying to help out a fellow Redditor who truly deserves it.

[You may remember me as the Redditor who begged for a job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dqs3i/im_going_to_be_blunt_i_need_a_job_reddit_help/) and ended up receiving one from the legendary Redditor [Hans Masing](http://www.reddit.com/user/hmasing) who you might remember as the Redditor who gave [a sick and bullied girl a special day](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dr6sy/kathleen_the_little_girl_with_huntingtons/c12atqx).

I'm not trying to spam for his store or his website, but if you have sons, daughters, nieces or nephews and still need to do some holiday shopping for them, why not order [from a fellow Redditor](https://brainstationtoys.com/)? Especially one as cool and selfless as Hans? 

Hans owns and operates a retail toy store called [Tree Town Toys](https://treetowntoys.com/) in Ann Arbor, MI. He is a good man and he and his wife run an honest business. At this time of year I'm sure you're all trying to find good gifts for the children in your life so why not shop for them either through [Brain Station](https://brainstationtoys.com/) (their website) or [the retail store itself](https://treetowntoys.com/) (which also has a website, obviously, but walk-in customers are welcome there!)?

For the record, I know I'm going to lose this job soon. I am asking you to consider [shopping here](https://brainstationtoys.com/) not because I think it will save or extend my employment but because, my hand to FSM, Hans and his wife are amazing. Very nice, very charitable, very cool, very Reddit-like. Such people should be supported, I think, over big-box chains like Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us.

Oh, and Hans is also a Reddit Secret Santa who actually shipped his gift out on time. So there's that in his favor, too!

Anyway, I'm just throwing this out there. Please upvote if want to support a fellow Redditor's business; feel free to downvote if you think this is spam (which, again, I assure you it is not; I will in no way profit from this post and if anything this post might actually annoy Hans if he finds out about it!). 

[Brain Station](https://brainstationtoys.com/) and/or [Tree Town Toys](https://treetowntoys.com/). Both owned by an awesome Redditor who refuses to use his Reddit-fame for profit. Please help me surprise him and his wife with a shit-ton of orders (pardon my language) today.

Oh, one last tiny request? If you do place an order and you need to call or make any kind of note on your order, say something like, ""Hey, Earl, the Narwhal bacons at midnight."". Just for the lolz (Earl is the shipping guy and he is not a Redditor... I would love to see the look of confusion on his face if he received multiple messages like this!).

Thanks, Reddit! 

**Update @7:05pm** I just got home from an amazing day at work. All I can say, Reddit, is that you guys are amazing. Everyone, including Hans and his wife, was blown away by your reaction to this post. I still can't quite believe it myself. I'm going to get something to eat but then I'm going to go through and reply to as many comments as possible. Thank you all so much for doing this!

By the way, poor Earl is still at work filling orders. I joked to him that I was going to try to convince Reddit to place even more orders so that he'll be stuck there until 2am. He laughed at my ""joke"" but I sensed a bit of fear, too! By the way, by the end of the day he decided he has to join Reddit. I think it's an *""if you can't beat them, join them* sort of mentality because you guys nearly broke him today!

**Update @10:50pm** I think I've finally managed to absorb this entire thread and I just want to thank you all again. For those of you who ordered something, or plan to order something, or just visit the store, I guarantee you will not be disappointed with the high level of customer service you will receive from my awesome coworkers. For those of you who simply contributed to this thread in other ways, thanks a ton! It was a blast to read through all the comments and it really encapsulated everything I love about the Reddit community. I especially like how the [picture of Earl and Kelly](http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs692.snc4/63202_10100326684483493_2244717_60998345_1150861_n.jpg) that Hans uploaded has already been made into a couple *meme-aspiring* pictures. My favorite so far is from Patcon: [Boxes?](http://imgur.com/fqOx5.png).

Speaking of Earl: I was totally joking in my last update when I said Reddit might have broken him. We're talking about a guy who takes five minute lunches most days and eats them standing up before rushing back into the warehouse to tackle whatever needs doing (hint: usually involves boxes). He does this by *choice*, too: Kelly only ever uses the loudspeaker when he's on the clock!

He looks like your average hard working, hard partying construction guy, hoodie, timberlands, tattoos, etc.  He needs an interpreter, usually these guys come in needing someone to translate court documents or divorce papers.  He says he needs someone to talk to his roommate.  I figure some dispute over the lease.  No problem.

Turns out his roommate is a 24 year old girl with late stage cancer who won’t leave her room and won’t see a doctor.  She moved in 4 months previous, having just been diagnosed with cancer.  Within a month she couldn’t work anymore.  Her family cut her off and won’t talk to her or help her in any way.  She was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and has been working cleaning hotel rooms since she was 16.  This guy, this almost a stranger, has been caring for her for 3 months.  He feeds her, cleans her room for her, does her laundry, buys all her food, pays all of the bills and the rent, and tries to get her to visit a hospital.  His girlfriend comes over and helps her bathe once or twice a week.  All of this while not speaking English and she doesn’t speak Spanish.  He doesn’t have working papers so he is nervous to go to the police and she keeps begging him to let her just die.  

He finally decided it didn’t matter if he got deported she just had to get the hospital.  He wanted us to talk her into it.  She was so sick and so miserable.  She had completely given up, she just lay on a small mattress on the floor wrapped in this cheap pink blanket with bunnies on it, in this small stinky room in a broken down trailer.  She muttered curses, she said the whole world can just fuck itself, and threw things limply at us.  We have to get a doctor to visit her at the house because she won't agree to go to the hospital.  He says she only has about a week or two to live.  This was what happened at my job today.  I would like to talk more about it.  I am having a hard time.  

UPDATE: We teach English and other Language classes, help people get their driver's licenses, and offer translation services.    My co-workers and I called a hospice service and they intervened.  She is in the hospital now, on morphine, thank god.  The hospice is taking care of the bills  Her roommate has special permission to visit and the Hospice has guaranteed that they will not report him.  They are putting our agency as a referral so his name isn't in the paper work.  I just can't that picture of her out of my head, just laying there feeling utterly rejected by the world, completely beyond feeling sorry for herself, beyond crying, just waiting to die.   Fuck, it is killing me right now.   I can't stop crying.  

EDIT:  Thanks everyone.  I love reddit, even the trolls give me a little lol on occasion.  I am going to bed now.  I will post more tomorrow after I swing by and visit her.  

EDIT:  This wasn't meant to be a commentary on health care and immigration.  Just a sad story about dying alone and taking great risks for another human being you hardly know.  

**
Final Update:  This is going to sound made up cause it is so f-ing sad.  She died last night at 12:30.  The hospice called Pedro and asked him to come down cause she wouldn't stop saying his name, he came and told her something religious and then she died.  I went over to see how he was doing and he told me just how evil her family is.  They were hosting fundraisers and had jars with her picture on it, raising money to help her with her cancer.  She never saw any of that money. He said they never once came to visit.  I am so angry and sad. **

Reddit, you would have cried yourself. He was using Verizon.net for email. Internet Explorer for a browser, and his router was hooked up... you aren't going to believe this... OUTSIDE on the screened-in porch. As you could imagine his email was damn near useless. IE was a couple of Kb/sec away from dead, and all the websites loaded worse than a 56K modem.

So over the course of 3 hours I introduced him to Gmail, Chrome, and indoor routing technology. He works in real estate and car sales, so I blew his freaking mind showing him Street View, explaining to him he no longer had to drive out to a property just to look at it, or order maps just to see the size of a lot from above. I honestly can not explain the joy in his eyes. It was as if he got to live in a future he never thought possible.

I showed him the neat tricks with Gmail as far as sorting his emails and stuff, as well as the wonders of tabbed browsing and bookmark toolbars. Everything ran so smooth and simply that even at 78 years old he could navigate Street View like a champ.

So thank you, Google. Thank you so much for making a lonely frustrated old man happy today.

Even though I'm going to have to go back tomorrow to remind him how to do it all over again.

After one hour, I saw the backlash starting and people that were inspired and were enthusiastic about it were criticized for not doing their research.

Reddit is probably the most helpful platform to me when it comes to scrutinizing popular news items and reports because of the amount of debate and digging that often goes on in the comments. 

I felt we could steer the attention Kony 2012 got more towards charities that have actually been proven to be effective and efficient rather than condition people to not give a fuck due to the backlash. I did a lot of research and picked Save The Children's work in the Horn of Africa for my experiment. 

To set it up, I asked the people at Fundrazr.com what the possibilities are and, aside from lowering their fees, they're letting me beta-test a new feature that lets me make a fundraiser for which anyone else can create sub-fundraisers that get tracked on a leaderboard and can easily be linked and embedded etc. I'm in no way affiliated with them but I wanna give them props for this because this is the kind of social media trend that I can actually get behind. 

Since this is an experiment to raise awareness, I'm aiming to go big with it and raise one million dollars over the next 100 days (and donations go straight to Save The Children btw). Even though I have recently managed to collect $23K for a previous charity event in only 4 days in total, one million is definitely still pretty crazy and I'll be going all out to try to make it happen (also, all donations are being matched so I need to reach $500K to get one million donated to Save The Children's work in the Horn of Africa). I don't have any expectations though and since I'm a long time redditor and have seen all the cool things the community has achieved, I thought I'd share it with you guys. 

Every redditor can set up his own sub-fundraiser and share it in less then a minute ( http://www.opsharecraft.com ), you can also read more info on the page. I'll also try to answer questions in the comments.

tl;dr: reddit saves kids, reddit inspires the world, reddit gets shit done, thx




edit: holy shit this is blowing up, almost $10K raised thus far and someone on the leaderboards is matching all donations you give to his sub-fundraiser, effectively quadrupling the total of all his fundraiser's donations


edit #2: This is the guy doubling (matching) donations to his sub-fundraiser: http://goo.gl/xfmBr . Since all donations are already matched, this actually quadruples donations and he'll do it up to $20K. If we hit $20K on his fundraiser, that makes it an $80K donation.


edit #3: The person being rank one on the leader-board told me he will stay rank one and will add any donations required to keep his spot. So basically if people donate through http://goo.gl/xfmBr every 10$ will effectively become 80$ (8x!!!) up to 20k$ (=160k$).",,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,,True,t3_refau,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/refau/reddit_vs_kony2012/,

I'm not even sure if it's the right place/sub. It will be short since I'm on my phone, and my replies may likely be few and far between...

She's between going through severe depression/suicideality for about 3.5 years. The hospital visits have between numerous (20+), mainly in acute facilities, but also in one high-end residential facility. This is not including the many ER visits and ambulance rides. 

Thus far, I've always been able to follow my gut and catch it in time, usually serious attempts at overdosing. I would carry her medications around wherever I went, both at home and away. I'd stay awake as long as she did (2, 3, 4am +), even when I had to work the next morning. Yet, she always found a way. She was a VERY smart girl, which really hindered my ability to prevent the attempts and keep her alive.

Despite her overwhelming urge to harm herself, she NEVER did this when she was alone with the kids, ever. She loved them immensely and would never have put them in that situation. They were her world. 

She had been having a lot of trouble emotionally over the last few weeks while she was out of town, and had been hospitalized there as well. She came home Sunday and we had a truly awesome day. We had worked out our issues and the future looked amazing. She planned to go to a local facility Monday to get her head back where it needed to be so we could move on, but we never made it to Monday. 

I won't go into too many details as there is an active police investigation ongoing, and I'm not sure if that would interfere. However, I will say that she was shot and killed by multiple police officers. Yes, I was there, maybe 40 feet away. I could not quite see her due to my angle, which I'm grateful for. However, the sounds of their firearms is something that will haunt me for the rest of my life.

I don't even know what to do with myself at this point. I've lost my best friend, a piece of me. Our children's mother. The icing on the cake? My in-laws are suing for custody, and since the kids were in Dallas visiting when the process began, I'm not allowed to bring them home till it's over. That is harder than I can put into words.

I'll get through this, and I'll end up with my kids, but right now it's killin me. As hard as it is at this point, I really don't think it's hit me fully yet, if at all. I'm afraid that may happen during her service next week. :/

I think I really just needed to get that off of my chest relatively anomalously...

We're both a little nerd-ish, and used to have a sort of ""system"" for our desktops; every other year, we'd each build a new one, and in the year between, we'd upgrade the ones we had with more RAM or a new video card or something. The past five years, though, finances haven't allowed that to happen. Mine is only three years old because he skipped the last new one for himself so I could have one, but his is nearly six years old. It's slow and starting to throw BSODs, and although the long-awaited Mafia II finally came out, and he does want it (he *loved* Mafia), his system isn't anywhere near fast enough to run it.

I got a new job early this year, and since August, have been putting away a little money from each paycheque. I didn't mention it to him, and if he even knows, he hasn't a clue how much. He'd probably guess I have a few hundred if you asked him. Actually, I had enough to buy components for a not-too-shabby computer, so I hopped on Newegg and ordered everything this weekend, including Mafia II. I'm rather excited--I can't *wait* to see his face on Christmas morning when he doesn't get the usual clothes and other stuff he needs (not wants)--but since I'm a middle-aged woman in a small town in the US midwest, there's no one to tell. My best friend describes herself as a ""computer r-tard"", my other friends don't know the difference between a $300 eMachines at Wal-Mart and a decent gaming system, and I *am* the IT department at work, so I don't even have colleagues to tell. Everyone I've told so far hasn't really understood anything past ""new computer"", and they get that glazed-eye look when I try to explain. So...I'm telling Reddit, even if no one reads it. He's not a redditor, so he won't see it.

I couldn't afford the very best, but it'll do for now, and it's a vast improvement over what he's got! Phenom X6 1055T, CM Hyper 212 Plus, 6GB DDR3 1600, 1GB Nvidia GeForce 465, ASUS MB with support for up to 16GB RAM and dual SLI video cards if he chooses in the future, 1TB WD HDD. DVD burner, 650w PSU and a pretty cool-looking Antec mid-tower case. 23"" 2ms Samsung monitor, 64-bit Win7 Pro, and Mafia II. I even remembered the Arctic Silver. He and I will probably put everything together on Christmas day, since it'll be just the two of us here, and I don't think I could be more excited if I were the one getting the new system. Yes, I know there are people who won't be having much of a Christmas this year, and there some who don't even have a place to live, but dammit, I worked hard and saved to surprise my beloved for Christmas, and I can't feel guilty.

This morning the closed all of the main roads leading in or out of the area and laid on the tear gas and water cannons. We closed all the windows and had to put tape on one to keep as much gas out as we could. Below us people were running from the police who just kept spraying them. For some people it got so bad that they were just hunched over on the side of the road vomiting and crying from the gas. I was given the choice to stay, but the opposition party is calling for a vote of no confidence in the government and for protests everyday next week. Erdogan, the PM, addressed the international media saying that he was willing to work with the protestors but then on a Turkish network (his speech was translated by my Turkish mother) he called the people in Taksim fascists and liars and said that they should just stop because they weren't going to change anything.

But because Reddit is anonymous (although some of us have met each other in real life), we have no idea who really needs help and who just wants other people to fix their problems (such as one AskReddit where it was found out that the user was still gambling at FullTilt while broke).

It just seems so odd to me that we wouldn't fall for a [gas can scam](http://www.snopes.com/fraud/distress/stranded.asp), yet we will willingly give thousands of dollars to someone we don't even know on the internet.

I’m still pissed at the bastards who thought they understood the situation better than I did.  Don’t listen to them.  It’s just noise. They don’t know or understand what you do.

Amidst all the legal doings, all of the arguments over stuff and all of the other uproar that comes from splitting up there is another process you will be encountering and my advice is not to ignore it.  There is a mourning process that comes with this.  No matter how you feel about her now, not very long ago you were in love with this person and  you had a life together planned that is now gone.  It feels a lot like someone died.  Allow yourself go through that.  It’s normal.  At this point your options are either that or go out and buy the new Corvette and bang every broad between here and Panama.  Both of them are equally effective, but one is longer lasting and requires significantly less penicillin. 

I would also advise you to take the high road at every turn during the legal ranglings.  Years down the road you will remember whether or not you walked away with your dignity and your integrity in tact.  You won’t remember who got the most stuff.  It’s just stuff.  You have plenty of time to accumulate new stuff.  Both lawyers are going to want to wrestle in the gutter for every last nickel.  It’s not worth it. Just get it behind you. 

Go out and buy a 12 pack and rent the movie “War of the Roses.”  You will need the levity.  After the movie, avoid the urge to go out and piss on your future exwife’s fish.  If you’ve never seen the movie, you’ll understand later.

There is a hole inside of you that feels like you’ve failed at something that was really important….something that you were determined to not fail at. Everyone, including yourself and me can tell you that it isn’t true, but it doesn’t help.  I’d love to tell you that after a month it goes away, but that isn’t true either.  All that I can tell you for sure is that tomorrow will be just a little bit better than the day before was and that it does go away.  

The world is full of nasty bitter people who didn’t have the courage to step up and say “no. I can’t do this.  I can’t live this way.”  Most of them go onto the advanced course and raise nasty bitter children who repeat the cycle.  Give yourself a little bit of credit for making the sane decision to not be counted amongst them.  You can watch them every Saturday night on “COPS” if you like.  And who knows, maybe this is a step she needs to take in order to one day get better herself.  We all pray for that.

Aside from the girls between here and Panama, one piece of advice that a friend gave me that was REALLY good advice, was to make a commitment to stay out of any type of relationship for one year. That doesn’t mean that you can’t go to the movies or to dinner.  But, people make jokes about being on the rebound, and it still happens all the damn time.  That’s trouble you don’t need.  There are a thousand switches in your head and in your heart that need to be reset before you will be of use to anyone else.  There is nothing wrong with enjoying being a single guy for a while.  Go to Vegas.  Better still, go to New Orleans.  It might be outside of your budget, but I saw some shit down in Rio that would make your brother blush.

I promise, the sun will keep coming up.  In the wise words of George Carlin “God never give us more than we can handle…….unless of course you die of something.” There are things that you will take away from this thing that are going to make it that much better when you’re ready to give it another shot.  I can say with all honesty that if things had to be that bad in order for things to be this good, it was worth it.  I’m on your side and if you ever need to howl at the moon, or to talk through this, or anything else, I’m here.


Love always,

Your Uncle

P.S. I loved a girl in Panama once………nope…… by God I think I loved her twice.

I didn't mind at all. That's what best friends are for, right? He also said that when I arrived that he had someone special that he wanted me to meet.

Anyway, he worked at a parks and recreational firm where he set up and cleaned up after special events that were thrown in his company's facilities. He usually scored some free booze for us, so it wasn't a bad gig for him. I walked up to him, slapped him five, and he began introducing me to his two co-workers. 

One was a supervisor that was busy on the phone trying to talk to his girlfriend, so I didn't really get to know him. The other was a guy who could only be described as a ""Big ol' Country Boy"" at around 6'4"" and roughly 250 lbs. He had a rough face, huge hands and feet, and a crew cut. If you imagine the kind of guy that you figured could grow up to become a bouncer at a biker bar in about ten years, this would be the guy. 

He shook my hand and asked, ""Are you Ringside74?""

Not wanting to tempt fate, I nervously faked a chuckle and said, ""Who wants to know?""

""Yeah, you're Ringside74."" He replied. ""You used to protect me from bullies when we were in elementary school.""

I looked over at my friend and he was giving me a knowing and goofy smile over the whole situation. Realizing that this was the person that my friend had wanted to introduce me to, I turned back, looked up and down at this beefcake man-mountain and asked, ""Are you sure?""

He then gave me a huge, toothy grin and said, ""Yeah, I had a pretty intense growth spurt since we last saw each other. I'm gonna play linebacker for [awesome football school/school my buddy and I were going to] in the fall!""

The memories finally hit me. This kid used to be a little guy that wore overalls with clowns and ducks printed on them as late as the fifth grade. He would get picked on like crazy until I stepped in to save him. I remember people always tried to give him wedgies and swirlies, but my buddy (the same one who worked with him) and I would always pull him out of trouble and steal sugar cubes for him from the school's cafeteria kitchen to give to him so he'd feel better.

""Well, shit. That's great to hear! I'll be sure to cheer for you super loud at games. Don't forget about me when you become super famous in the NFL!"" I said.

""No doubt, man! You were there for me when I was a pipsqueak!""

Our college years together were epic. I got invited to all the parties that he did because he was such a stud player, and he was always a ""gentle giant"" with the girls. He's a great guy who's doing really well for himself now. Every time I think about it, I'm glad that he didn't let the bullying get him down.

Anyway, this is a sorta-boring story with a happy ending. I guess the moral is if you're the ""little guy"" that shouldn't get you down because in the long run, there are people that will care about you and they'll always be happy to be around you through the good and the bad.",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_zkuqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/zkuqz/i_ran_into_the_school_wimp_from_my_elementary_days/,

(If you don’t want the back-story, skip to the bottom for the tl;dr)

I founded [WePay.com](http://www.wepay.com) with a former college roommate in August 2008 – about a year after graduating from BC.  I was actually in law school at the time, but that definitely was not my bag.

The original idea was to build a website that made it really easy for “normal people” to collect money from friends, fans, members, supporters, attendees, whoever.  The idea hasn’t really changed much since then. We added additional tools like the ability to create/sell tickets and accept donations, but the basic value proposition has stayed the same: giving people an easy way to collect money from a bunch of other people.  

It’s worth noting that when we first started the company, we didn’t think too much about PayPal.  PayPal had never been a good solution for us personally (hence our desire to build something new), and it was geared toward merchants rather than consumers.  The original plan was certainly not to “take down PayPal.” 

Even though we [raised money from the founder of PayPal]( http://www.businessinsider.com/max-levchin-is-pretty-excited-about-a-new-payments-startup-called-wepay-2010-4), the comparison between the two companies was never made until PayPal decided to freeze the account of the Flux foundation  – a non-profit arts organization – just a few days before the Flux Crew headed to the desert to build their famous Temple at Burning Man. 
 
The Flux Foundation and a bunch of other people and organizations collecting donations [ended up turning to WePay](http://www.sfbg.com/politics/2010/08/13/paypal-freezes-out-other-groups-who-turn-wepay-updated) in protest (and in desperation).  And then people started comparing us to PayPal.

We were called the consumer-friendly or “community-oriented” version of PayPal. CNN actually referred to us as the [anti-PayPal.]( http://money.cnn.com/2010/10/12/technology/wepay/index.htm)
The comparison isn’t completely accurate because — as I said above — we are focused on helping everyday consumers collect money from people in their social circles, whereas PayPal is focused on helping merchants sell goods or services online. But it was great for us in terms of press and branding, so we embraced it: “Yeah, we are kinda like PayPal, but we love our customers, have great customer service, and try really hard not to freeze your accounts.

We took the PayPal/WePay contrast to the extreme when [we decided to drop 600 pounds of ice at PayPal’s annual developer conference](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/26/wepay-ice-paypal/).  In the block of ice was $500 and the words: “PayPal freezes your accounts.”  The prank hit the front page of reddit for about 30 minutes. Best. 30 minutes. Ever.  

From the comments, it became pretty clear that Redditors *really* don’t like PayPal. Many have had business accounts frozen, but many have also had their accounts frozen when they’ve tried to do something good for the community.  

I also noticed that whenever the Reddit community raises money for somebody in need, inevitably 3 or 4 people cry foul, saying the fundraiser is probably a scam. [One example]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ezggr/can_we_show_this_family_some_love/). [Another.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/exx5q/so_paypal_is_blocking_the_funds_we_raised_for_ted/) [And one more.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/enffi/redeeming_myself_i_am_a_kidney_donor_i_always/c19hg8v?context=3#c19fham
).

I’m really concerned with solving the: “you’re a scammer” problem. One of the cool things about [WePay](http://www.wepay.com) is that people can “join” your accounts (basically giving them view-only access to the account), so that they can see balance and transaction history, and so you don’t need to worry about maintaining transparency.  

Yesterday, we pushed a feature, inspired **specifically for the Reddit community,** intended to make it even easier. In your group account settings, you can enable the account so anybody can join, *without you having to invite them first.* The basic idea being that you can maintain full transparency, since everybody can see where the money is going. 

If the money isn't being allocated appropriately, anybody can cry foul. Everyone on Reddit can join if they’d like. Every time the account reaches $100, you can demand that the money be sent directly to the beneficiary. As a member of the account, you can monitor this. If the account balance ever exceeds one or two hundred dollars, and the money doesn't go to the right place, you can simply refuse to donate (and tell everybody else to do the same). 

I’m hoping that offering a PayPal alternative, and building a “transparency” feature for the Reddit community, will help reddit continue to do good things for good people, without the BS that goes along with it.

Let us know what you think, or suggest other features that would help Reddit do more awesome things. I’ll be monitoring the comments here to answer any questions you might have. 

**(tl;dr)**
Redditors are awesome and they love to raise money for good causes, but I’ve noticed that PayPal often gets in the way. [WePay](http://www.wepay.com) just pushed a new feature to make money bombing easier and more transparent — inspired by Reddit. Let us know what you think.

For this she had a VHS that she loved more than anything. It was the first three episodes of the anime ""[Hello! Sandybell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello!_Sandybell)"", a cute story about a young girl, who lives in Scotland. Sandybell is looking for her mother, and my sister watched the three episodes she had on VHS so many times that the tape broke in the end.

Flash forward to a year ago. Me, having looked for the complete series for a long time, I notice this ad on a DVD blockbuster webpage. It's an ad for the complete Sandybell series, all 47 episodes, on 5 DVDs. But it's not released yet. The blockbuster page has a signup form, to get a notice when it was, March 22, 2012.

I got a mail on March 22, saying that it had been released. I ordered it straight away, putting in my sisters address, so that she would get it in the mail. 

Today I got a call from my sister. She was crying. First I thought that something terrible had happened, but then I heard, it was a cry of joy. She slowly got herself together, and told me, that she had wanted to watch the end of that show since she had been eight years old, that this was the single best present she had ever got, and it wasn't even her birthday. 

I ask her what she's going to do for the rest of the day, and she goes: ""Well, first I'm going to put disc one into the DVD. Then I'm going to tell dad to get away from the remote, and go make me some popcorns. And then I'll just sit here until I'm done."", to which I say: ""You do know it's around 80 hours of anime, right?"". She didn't care.

The next day, I had an orangered.

&gt; haha i appreciate your proposal. I do not hate fat people. Where you from?

From here, I discovered that the person I had messaged was from the US. Nothing unusual about that of course, but I'm from Liverpool in the UK and so with 3,500 miles between us, the best I could ever hope for would be to make a new friend online.

We got chatting on Skype and found that we really got on well together both through messages, our humour and our attraction to each other. It was frustrating that it was only distance that was preventing us from being together.

About two or three weeks into speaking to each other, she asked me if was weird that she had been looking at how much flights to the UK would be. Just out of curiosity. I said I had been looking as well. Just out of curiosity. It turned out they were roughly $900 (£550) for a return ticket. Way too expensive for either of us.

I then remembered that my Mum was going on holiday in May for a week meaning that my house would be empty and it just seemed like a perfect opportunity to get her over here with the only major cost on her part being the plane ticket, rather than accommodation. With that in mind, we decided to go half on a plane ticket for her to come here. The ticket was booked the third week in April for her to come here the third week in May.

I went to meet her at the airport and waited at the arrival gates, excited and nervous. It was a long, long wait. She text me once she was off the plane saying she had arrived and after a while, she came through the doors.

A girl from 3,500 miles away had just spent 17 hours on a plane to come and stay with me in person after knowing each other for two months. I don't know if that blows anyone else's minds, but the whole situation felt surreal. Amazing, but not something that happens daily!

We gave each other a long hug. Something which we had been unable to do for the last two months via Skype. We then jumped in a cab and she laid her head on my lap to rest after her journey. It felt amazing being so close to her already.

Back at my house, I had prepared the spare room for her to sleep but I ended up laying with her. First cuddles and then we kissed. It felt right. We were happy to be together. We fell in love.

For the next seven days, we did lots of fun things together. I took her out into town for a night out, I went to a houseparty with her to introduce her to all of my friends. We made a cake together. We made [Barack Obama's chili](http://www.dietsinreview.com/recipes/barack-obama-chili/). I took her to see the [Albert Dock](http://patentsdesignsandbrands.com/custom/Albert_dock_at_night.jpg) and everything [Beatles](http://www.flickr.com/photos/bawtrees/3909331072/) related. I took her out for dinner.

We both laughed a lot over the time she was here with me and we also both cried a lot when the time came for me to say goodbye to her at the airport a week later. It was really fucking hard. Saying goodbye to someone you've spent such a good time with and feel so comfortable with is one of the hardest things to do. Knowing that you can't just pick up the phone and arrange to meet them whenever is painful.

Returning home after saying goodbye to her, my house felt empty. There was no life in it. I didn't know what to do. She made a big impact on my life. We were talking on Skype 20 hours she had left my arms for the last time and it felt so frustrating being able to see her on webcam but not being able to touch her anymore.

My hope is that we somehow manage to come up with the funds again for me to go to the US to visit her or for her to come here again as she makes my life feel so much happier when I'm around her. I wish I could have spent more time with her.

It is truly amazing to think that a single sentence on Reddit can change things in such a big way and I'm glad it did. The week I spent with her was one of the best of my life and though it was so painful saying goodbye to her, I would not change anything. It was a fantastic week together and one which we both hope to repeat at some point in the future.

**Thoughts on reddit:**
    
“I came for the posts but stayed for the comments.”  That pretty much sums reddit up for me.
    
It should be obvious that I am a hardcore lurker and that that I don’t care about my karma.  I’ve never understood why someone would care.  If I could somehow spend them to woo women or purchase super powers, it would be a TOTALLY different story.   This is a self post so I don’t get karma for it.  
    
**On how reddit has changed:**
    
Six years ago it might take me an hour to get through the front page.  The front page turned over MUCH slower and the links had lots of depth.  I would click on a link, read the article and then come back to read the comments.  Sometimes just reading the associated article took 10 minutes.  The comments might take another 10.   Today, it takes me 60 seconds max to get through the front page.  The linked content doesn’t have the same depth.   I actually spend way less time on reddit than I used to.  This is probably due to the fact that I have a busy life outside the internet (wife, learning to paint, learning to play piano, crossfit and personal projects) and partly due to the content shift of reddit.  The demographics of reddit have changed too.  The average reddit user is much younger and I suspect I have less in common with them.  I love to learn new things.  It’s the greatest passion of my life.  
    
My browsing philosophy has been simple.  Look for gems (posts and comments) and upvote them.  Ignore reposts and everything else unless it is blatant spam. I didn't even know that the down vote was a different color until last year.  I have a rule of not going past the first 500 posts.  
    
It’s been a pleasure being part of the reddit community even as a lurker.   If they ever open a lurker Olympics, I am so in the running for the gold medal.

She would be kind about it, but she couldn't really understand, and even if she could I just don't want her to know such things even exist.  

Without telling her about it, she can never know what she means to me.  She should know, but while I can tell her she means a lot to me, I can't possibly make her see how much.  It would probably freak her out anyhow.  So I will just write it instead.

I have endured a particular sort of hell.  I was abused by my mother, then abandoned by her, neglected after that, and I've had a lot of issues from all that.  I have had a strange and isolated life.  

My mother physically abused me, to the point of broken bones, but as bad as that was it was almost trivial compared to the weird emotional hell she put me through.  To have some idea of what it was like you would have to imagine your mother crying, or someone else you love, someone who you just cannot stand to see hurt.  There is such an intense urgency to that, a desperate need to make it stop.  She was abusive but she was also my mother, she baked cookies and gave hugs, she would hold me.  She was both, and it took both to make hell complete.

I had a bedwetting problem.  She would come up those stairs and sometimes she would be understanding, say it was no big deal, clean me up and change the sheets.  Other times she would get upset.  She would look into my eyes, and she would look so sad, and say that it hurt her so much for me to keep doing this, how she tried so hard to make things nice and I ruined everything, how I made the whole house smell.  She would beg me to stop.  I couldn't stop of course, but I would stand there in the darkness shivering and hating myself.  I was hurting her, and I wanted to stop so much.  

Then she would start getting angry, her eyes would go blank and the storm would come.  Hitting, slapping, pinching.  Muttered, spitting threats, asking me ""do we need to cut it off?"", threatening me with scissors.  She would push my face into the pool of urine in the plastic sheet like training a dog.  

It got to the point where I didn't even resist.  I was so crushed with guilt and I hated myself, I would not even raise my hands to protect my face.  I would lay there limp as she shoved my face into the dark plastic, the urine stinging and getting in my mouth, my arms limp.  It seemed right to do that to me, I didn't fight it.  On the few occasions I did struggle she would go insane and throw me around, broke my collarbone once when I was 5 and then threw me back in bed and told me to stop my caterwauling, didn't take me to the doctor till the next day.  

Being hit and thrown may break my bones but words can twist and break me.  She humiliated me, stood me up in church when I was 8 and told the congregation about my bedwetting so they could pray about it, including the other kids there.  Out of all of it that is still my worst memory, seeing the one girl there I liked kneeling and praying about my bedwetting.  I could never even look at her again.

My mother would beg me to stop and I could not stop.  You can tell me now it was not my fault but you can't go back to 1974 and tell my 5 year old self anything like that.  The shame was crushing, total, soul-rending.  I hated myself.  

I started a ritual when I was 7 or so.  I would refuse to urinate, in the daytime.  I would hold it, no matter how much it hurt.  I would run into the bathroom so I could hold it, 3 feet away from relief, so that no one could see me struggle.  A weird little ritual, and I would become lost in stubborn rage, hating myself with a cold and furious intensity.  The ritual got more intense over time.  I liked it, I liked the rage and control.  I liked the pain.  It was my pain, I owned it.  

Even when I had kidney infections and bladder problems, even when I was in the hospital with a fever from it, and would wake up in pink sheets stained from urinating blood, even when the pain of holding it was like being stabbed, I refused to go.  It made no sense but I was not rational at that point.  In that weird ritual I found a sort of peace, some sense of control I suppose.  

I essentially took over the job of hating and abusing myself.  I eventually did more and worse to myself than my mother ever did.  At eight years old I had to go to the doctor with lacerations after I tried to cut off my penis.  And that was only the feeble beginning of The Ritual.  

She left home when I was 10.  She didn't even say goodbye or acknowledge she was leaving.  I knew why, of course.  Couldn't stand the smell any more.  It may seem like a good thing that she left but it shocked me, twisted me.  I had no idea that could happen.  It was utter total confirmation that I was garbage.  I lived with my father, who didn't bother with details like going to laundromats or talking to me.  I lived in filth and darkness, and withdrew from the world.  

I hated myself.  In particular I hated that part of me that loved my mother, the part that wanted the hugs and the cookies, that wanted to be held, that wanted to reach out and connect, the part that was human at all.  Whenever I felt that urge to come out and play I would strangle it, kill it, burn it.  

The ritual became more intense, I pushed the envelope, reveling in my ability to take the pain and make it mine.  I became very determined to never need or be vulnerable to anyone.  Just then, puberty arrived.  Not very good timing.  A sudden need to be close to females, of all people.  That was not going to happen.  

Where some might feel a want and take steps to fulfill it, I felt a want and took steps to kill the want.  I hated my desire for girls in much the same way as I had irrationally hated my desire to urinate, and it was conveniently centered in the same anatomical location.  I refused to even look at girls.  If I saw a pretty girl I was left feeling nothing but empty despair.  And I would reach under my bed for the red plastic box, and in the ritual of needles, razors and flames I would find peace.  

I continued wetting the bed till I was about 17.  I continued the holding-it ritual till about 15 or so.  I was not always successful in this, there were wet spots.  There I was in high school, filthy, reeking of urine, wetting my pants, never speaking a word.  Somehow I did not get elected homecoming king.  An oversight, I assume.  

I did not think about girls or fantasize at all, or engage in the usual accompanying personal activity, till I was over the age of 30.  I quit school at 15, after barely attending at all before that.  I once noticed I had gone a couple of days without talking to anyone and started counting.  I got to 21 days in a row without a word, a nod, a wave, anything, at home or school.  A librarian said hello to me to break the streak.  I am sure I have broken that record many times over since then but haven't counted.

I grew older and moved out, getting and losing various jobs, finding ways to manage.  I didn't know I was mentally ill, I just thought I was a weird fuckup.  I could not stand to be in a place where I could not just leave, like at most jobs.  If I couldn't leave I would start to get panicky and make crazy decisions.  I had some success as a pizza delivery guy, where I got to leave every 20 minutes.  I developed a way of interacting with people, superficial joking around, never talking much.  I was invisible.  I referred to other people as TOWLOMS, or The Ones Who Live Outside My Skull.  

I made a fairly feeble but seemingly dramatic effort to kill myself at 26, and wound up in therapy after I got out of the hospital.  I then discovered I was crazy.  I hoped I would get cured but it didn't quite happen like that.  Things got worse before they got better.  

I lived in shelters, went into various mental wards, stayed on couches and even in a tent once.  I slowly started to come out of it.  There was something I needed to do, which no therapist told me about.  I had to admit I loved her, loved my mother.  I had to feel that again.  I had to vomit up all that poison.  I did not want to.  

I was detached, invulnerable, unaffected.  I had to be detached, desperately needed to be disconnected.  It was my only way, I had spent years of insane effort to be invulnerable and need no one.  But I had to admit that was all a lie, and that I was still that piss-soaked cringing little kid who wanted his mommy.  I had to stop hating him.  Someone had to take his hand and let it be OK, and no one on earth could do it but me.  

I am nearly 43 now and have come out of the darkness, mostly.  There are still a lot of bad days.  I have not spoken to my mother in years.  I still have a lot of problems, and sometimes I think it is too late for me.  I still get nervous around people, rarely make eye contact, hardly ever physical contact.  I live in a sort of shelter/boardinghouse and work part time doing dishes.  I have still never been on a date or kissed or anything.  Not a lot of people go on their first date at 43, and besides being old I am fat, bald, mental, broke, no car, teeth like a 12th century pirate, and I have a lot of weird scars that would be hard to explain.  

But I am also intelligent, creative, deeply kind, thoughtful, gentle, funny, and apparently a good dancer.  More on that later.

In the past year or so I have been making an effort to open up a little, to connect, to be human for a while before I die.  I have had some limited success.  It has been simultaneously wonderful and terrifying.  

There is a girl at work.  Before you start getting excited, I am not going to date her.  She is 19, and I am very definitely not 19, and it just isn't about that.  She is bubbly and random, cute and funny, she lights up the world.  I cannot manage to be depressed around her, and I am a world fucking champion at being depressed.  And she likes me.  She goes out of her way to talk to me, initiates chats with me on Facebook, she lights up when she sees me.  

She hugged me for heaven's sake.  She could not know it was the first time I had been hugged in just about 8 years.  For her it was just a casual friendly thing to do.  For me it was like a simple glass of water in the desert.  

Without meaning to, she has helped me keep going in this process.  I have had some very bad days but then she shows up and it's amazing how I instantly feel better.  Obviously any guy would want to date her, but that is clearly not on the agenda, and she has never hinted at any such feelings.  I think of her as a friend, my very best friend. That is fine, and more than fine, it is glorious.  I love the friendzone, it is a spectacular place to be.  

I have enlisted her help in starting to date.  I have to get a car and normal place to live, and get some things straightened out.  But I need her help and advice, and I think it is a good idea to have a girl's opinion on things.  I think I might eventually find someone.  

She does not know and cannot know about me.  I could not tell her of the urine and the needles and the scissors and the degrading shame.  These things do not exist in her world, and never should.  And I don't want her to feel pity or obligation, I know my story is overwhelming and intense.  I want her to hug me because she likes me, not to try to make up for the hell I have endured.  

A few days ago I was not doing well at all.  Depressed, nervous, and nearly called in sick to work.  I had to go though, can't risk being fired.  She came to see me at work on her day off, and just as we were all finishing up and getting ready to leave, she said something about dancing.  I said I didn't think I had ever done that.  She took my hand, and said we were going to dance right now.  A waitress there got a video of it on her phone.

I don't know where I go from here.  But though misery and hell, through shame and despair, I fucking [danced](http://youtu.be/FdchxOGbSLs).  

Do not ever give up hope, even when hoping feels like torture.  You just never know what might happen.

1284184167.0,899,self.self,dcejr,I am a Muslim teenager in America. This is what I think about 9/11.,Inquiry,1749,850,668,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dcejr/i_am_a_muslim_teenager_in_america_this_is_what_i/,"I know this will probably be ignored by the Reddit masses but I hope if you read this it gives you a little insight into the American Muslim perspective.

 I feel like alot of people have been asking ""Where are the majority of Muslim voices? Why do they not speak up?"" So for you all (and a bit for myself), I'm sharing my own story.

A little bit of background: I am raised Muslim and have been going to mosques around the country (especially in the South) ever since I was a little kid. My father is very active in our local Muslim community and so from, an early age, I've seen the ins and outs of American Muslims.
 Personally, I've gone through my own ups and downs in my faith, but I'm not here to argue or debate about religion. I'm here to share with you a side of the story that not many people have heard.

I was in fifth grade when the attacks happened. At the time, I had no idea how it would impact me as a Muslim kid (honestly, it just seemed like a cool action movie to me). As I went through middle school, it really hit me how much my life had changed. Suddenly, every time my name was called out in class, I could hear snickers from the other students. Our mosque was vandalized multiple times and my dad even received death threats from our own neighbors. It seemed like my world was collapsing and, in my 13 year old head, there was nothing I wanted more than to be a ""normal white kid.""

As I grew older, I realized that 9/11 was truly a wake up call for me and other Muslims in America. We were placed in a spotlight that we had no experience acting under. For Muslim immigrants across the country, they were in a foreign place with no understanding of the culture or the American people. But for us, Muslims who were born in America, we were still Americans. We still loved our country and our religion and, by God, we weren't going to give up either of them.


Today, I know that every minority in America has gone through a ""hazing"" period. Jews, Japenese, blacks, and Catholics have all gone through (and are still going through) what Muslims feel like we're going through now. As a Muslim and as an American, I have one simple request: If you are Muslim in America, don't be scared. Be willing to go out and talk about what you believe and be the best American you can be. If you are not Muslim, don't be scared. Be willing to look at others, not as different, but as another human being. Listen to each other and, I promise, doing this will solve a whole lot of problems.

tl;dr: We're all people with our own stories and our own ways of life. If anything, Muslims and non Muslims should honor 9/11 by trying to bridge the gaps which divide us as a country.

Edit: Wow thanks for all of the insightful comments. I'll definitely try to answer any concerns anyone might have.

And no, it didn't involve sticking it up his arse!",mobfather,1447,589,415,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/df3wh/how_i_wiped_the_smile_off_my_bank_managers_face/,"A few months ago I tried to close my LloydsTSB bank account due to the fact that I have banked elsewhere for the past few years. Then, a couple of weeks ago I started receiving 8am phonecalls from the LloydsTSB call centre in India where somebody would ask me - in pigeon English if I would chat. It transpired that instead of closing my account, some admin error had meant that my account had been upgraded to the LloydsTSB Platinum account - which incurs charges of £17 a month.

Because I'd cleared the account of funds there was obviously nothing to pay this new monthly fee. My account then went into the red by £17. Because of this, it meant that I was now liable for an unauthorised overdraft charge... of £20 a day!

This all occured without my knowledge until the man from the Indian call centre duly informed me that the account which I had believed had been closed was now in the red by approximately £700! I was then told that I had until the end of the month to pay it back or else the bank would start legal proceedings against me.

As you can imagine, I was not happy and made an appointment to go and see the bank manager to discuss the issue.

I arrived at the bank for my 9:30 meeting and at 10:15 was finally beckoned into the managers office. The arrogant smirking bastard then proceeded to tell me that it was up to the banks discretion to move people onto the correct account for their circumstances and instead of them closing my account, they had decided to offer me the opportunity to try out their 'Platinum Account'.

I proceeded to tell them that I'd not asked for this, but the still-smirking bank manager proceeded to wax lyrical about how I really would appreciate the benefits of the account (free phone insurance, AA membership etc...) and it was unfortunate that I'd incurred the charges but there was nothing he could do about it.

He then proceeded to patronizingly rub it in by then telling me that because of the banking crisis, the bank was exploring new ways of reclaiming money and there were lots of people in my position.

It was then that I was struck by the divine hand of inspiration!

Taking my iPhone from my pocket, I said to the bank manager ""You do realise that I've been recording this entire conversation?""

To which the bank manager started sprouting off some gubbins about how I should have informed him that I was doing this and my actions were illegal and therefore inadmissable evidence against any claim.

I then replied ""That's probably true, but I'm sure that if I post this conversation onto a Facebook page, it's not going to look good for you. You've mentioned your name, explained how you upgraded my account instead of closing it and you've also pretty much explained how you're aware this is effecting lots of people. I wouldn't want to be you!""

To cut a long story short, he eventually agreed to waive the £700 of fees and restore my account back to dormant status. Hilariously, I still couldn't close my account because I'd not brought the correct ID with me.

I hadn't actually recorded a thing! :o)",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_df3wh,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/df3wh/how_i_wiped_the_smile_off_my_bank_managers_face/,

One of these women, after several drinks seemed interested in me, and had no inhibitions about putting her hand on my crotch, inside my shirt and variously pawing at me. When I removed her hands from me, along with a joke to avoid escalating it into an ugly conflict, she seemed to take this as a challenge, and became more aggressive, as if to establish my body as territory she owned. I disengaged by leaving the table for a bathroom break, and seated myself apart from her when I returned.

Everybody was having a good time, and I wouldn't have allowed myself to become bothered if that was as far as things went. However, on my return, the woman who had been aggressively grabby announced to the table - “I need to move my seat too” then moved across to where I was sitting, and pressed herself into my lap, boobs first into my face, and ground her hips against mine, pinned under her in the bar's bench seating. She yelled something like  “now you're mine” or something similar.

It took me about 5 seconds to free one arm with her weight pinning me down, and I threw her off me, onto the floor, which being drunk, she hit face first. I might have said “off” or “get off” 

She was unhurt, and rebounded from the floor almost instantly, although she was now visibly angry. 
I don't remember what she said, if anything, but two bouncers converged on me within a few seconds, and dragged me out of the bar, ejecting me through the fire exit by throwing me against the crash-bar door to open it. I landed in the alley hard enough to knock the wind out of myself, and walked home, half soaked. 

Within the next week, I was punched in the face by one of the other men at our table at the bar, and spat-on by a woman who until then I'd though was a friend.

This was all years ago, and I have no social contact with anyone from that crowd. However, I have heard that the story agreed on by the woman who I thew to the floor and her friends is that I raped her.

And that's what being sexually assaulted is like, if you're male. It did not even occur to me that this was sexual assault against myself until years later.

From 3 until 6:30, there were three people working with customers, and one baker. The shift leader, me, and another regular employee. The other regular employee was set to work until what is known as ""volume."" In our store, that means whenever the afternoon rush is over, they can leave with the permission of the shift leader. It's also their job to help do some of the things that the closers would have to do later. 

For instance, there are coolers that need to be swept and mopped behind. This can be done at any point in the day. If it's an extremely busy day, this will be left until after the restaurant closes. If not, someone just does it during the afternoon. This is basically the only thing the shift leader asked the other employee to do before leaving. Other than that, they were just instructed to help me in taking orders in front and on drive through, since I can't do both at once obviously. 

The other employee basically did none of that. I had no help and the coolers were not swept behind or mopped behind. Eventually, the shift leader sent the other employee home, and told me that he was sick of seeing that employee not help or do anything, but still whine that they wanted to leave. This pushed the responsibilities of those small things to me and my shift leader.

So now it was just me and my shift leader, with the baker in back making donuts. Little did we know, the baker decided not to check with the shift leader before leaving. Nor did the baker make very many extra donuts to sell during the last few hours of the evening.

And I don't know if you knew this, but at Dunkin Donuts, donuts are popular.

By 8:00, we had a total of maybe 20 donuts of different kinds. 

Every single person that came into the store looked at the shelves of donuts and said, ""Is that all you have?""

When someone came through the drive through, my shift leader would say, ""I'm sorry, but the only donuts we have are..."" and then would list out the few donuts we had left. 

Customers were all frustrated or confused with how this had happened. I was waiting for it to happen. For a customer to blow up on me for not having their favorite donut, or not having enough of a certain kind. For letting the supply get this low.

But do you know what happened?

Nothing.

Not a single customer got angry. Not a single one raised their voice. No one threw a fit. No one yelled at either me or my shift leader. 

Anyone who has worked in the food industry will tell you, people who don't get the food that they want exactly when they want it get mad, fast. They will explode on the lowest person on the totem pole and convince them they have no reason to live because they did X, Y, or Z wrong and that led to them not getting the food they wanted.

But tonight? That didn't happen. Not once. The most common thing I heard tonight was, ""Don't worry about it. It's not your fault. I'll come back tomorrow.""

It may seem sad, but this just moved me somehow. Everyone was so... understanding. 

I guess I just wanted to get this out there. I don't expect anyone to read this whole thing: all 3344 characters. But if the only thing you read in this is the very last sentence, then I want you all to know: **Good things can still happen, even if everything goes wrong.**

This note is going out to a group of loved ones, family, and friends who should be kept in the loop about this.

This week papers will be filed for Jane's and my divorce. Divorce will be final in about 90 days.

This is not going to be an ugly divorce. There is lot of love and compassion that we have for each other. This will be a no contest divorce, and we do not even feel the need for lawyers. Our shared priority right now is Joe, and we are planning for joint custody.

I ask that during this difficult time, feel free to reach out to us, spend time with us, visit us, or whatever (all that would be nice :-))... but generally refrain from delving into the why's and how's of our splitting up. Just know that there are no victims, that there's a lot of love, and we are both doing our best. I'm putting in this note the information that I think is important for you to collectively know.

I know that this does not need saying to the group of people that I am sending this note to, but I think it is important for me to articulate anyway: Please do not feel the need to ""choose sides"" out of some misplaced urge to demonstrate loyalty between Jane and me. There is no need. Jane is a wonderful person, and I certainly hope that we remain close friends throughout our life... and that if anything our friendship and connection grows over time. Goodness knows that for the sake of Joe we need that to happen. If anything, bear in mind that at this time in our life both Jane and I probably need and appreciate family and friends more than ever.

That is all for now. If you pray, keep us in your prayers right now. And thank you for being there :-)

Love,

John.

John,

Jane had told me this yesterday...and my last piece of advice to her was this - remember when this is signed - that it is done. Make you know what you are doing ......

I hope you know that I have never taken sides - I love you both - I think you are both wonderful people and amazing parents. I have always advocated following one's heart - 

this is a very difficult process for you both right now and you both need to go through and you will both come out fine and stronger ...

I wish you both all the very best and I hope god's you the serenity and the strength to move on and to forge ahead.

You will always be my friend John so please do not feel otherwise....I love ya very much and I know you are hurting and if there is anything that I can do to help please let me know.

Know that as a dear friend to Jane I will always be there to help her in life - to make her laugh and smile when she is down, to help her see thing from a different point of view if needed but she's a pretty good egg. 

I know that you will also be ok and if ya ever need to chat give me a buzz.....

------------------------My reply-------------
 
John Smith June 9, 2009 at 8:58am 

Jess,

I'm going to vent a little here, and you are not going to like it. But I have to, so bear with me.

First, let me say that I generally like you. At one point, I would have even said I loved you as a member of our family.  I believe that in your own way you want the best for all involved, and that you would do just about anything you could for Jane. That you want her to be happy. But truthfully, I don't want to be your friend, and I don't want you in my life.  I think you are a hypocrite, definitely to me, but also to yourself.

Here's why...

You do have a big role in Jane's an my divorce. That's a fact.

Whether you realize it or not, you have HUGE influence on Jane. In fact, to use her own words, she didn't first cheat on me with Ryan, she first cheated on me with you. And I'd say I agree with her. Whenever she decided that her bond and her relationship with you is more important to nurture and protect than that of her family (and I am her family), that was a huge step in our breakup.

Also, I KNOW (because Jane told me) that you were the one who first suggested to her that she have an affair with Ryan. I know you teased her about him (her ""French boyfriend""), and encouraged a romance outside of our marriage.

I do believe you think you are supportive of Jane regardless of what she wants, and that you just want her to be happy. But the fact is, I don't think you are truly being supportive. Instead, I think you two have been providing emotional validation to each other. There is a huge difference! Every text I have accidentally received from you (true, not many) has been incredibly negative about our marriage. The last one blew me away (something along the lines of ""ughh... the only chemistry that marriage counselor is going to find between you two is hate. I know... follow your heart"". I do understand that you may have been reacting to stuff she has told you, but I would NEVER, EVER validate for Karl (or anyone else) his behavior the way I think you have validated hers. I know (because Jane has told me) that you've also told her things about Ryan like ""awww... you really love him... you need to be with him!"". You now, if Jane had come back from Dr. Johnson's that day saying that she was going to go for it with that ass of a man, instead of trying to see if she could reconnect with me, I strongly suspect that the text I would have received from you would have been a lot more enthusiastic and positive.

Also, let me tell you that this ""Follow your heart"" mantra is bull!!! 
To start with, I truly believe that for you and Jane ""Follow your heart"" has come to mean ""You/I are unhappy in our marriage... must find happiness somewhere else"". 
Anyway, you don't follow your heart, you Bring it! Following your heart is a recipe for lifelong misery. You will always be behind it, always chasing it, never nurturing all that you have to the potential that is there. Instead, you make a decision, you commit to it, and you pour your heart into it. Yes, there is risk in that, but much less risk than just chasing your heart all the time.
You know, if I had been just trying to follow my heart throughout this ordeal with Jane, I wouldn't be here right now. I wouldn't have decided to do my best to be here for her and offer love and support on a daily basis regardless of whether in the moment I felt she deserved it or not. And regardless of whether we get divorced or stay married, I'm glad I did. I've learned a lot about Jane, myself, and love. Everything stopped being about the outcome, but in the process, of figuring out what one can do for the other person on THEIR terms. I am confident that no matter what happens between Jane and me, I can and will find happiness... not because I know how to follow my heart, but because in this whole process I did the opposite. I learned how to bring my heart, and discovered what unconditional love is all about.

You know, it is not any of my business (other than the fact that you do have a lot of influence on Jane, and I think this has played a big role on things), but I know about you and Dan. I've known for a very long time. In fact, Jane accidentally let me know that you were having an affair the day I figured out about her and Ryan (I told you, she's really sloppy). I know Jane passes messages to you from him, so that Karl doesn't find out, which totally blows my mind!!! Let me give you some unsolicited, but honest advice here:

Right now, you are in 2 very unhealthy relationships. You need to fix your relationship with Karl before you have a fair chance at having a healthy relationship with someone else. Whether or not you and Karl stay married, put your heart into making it this best marriage you can NOW. If you guys divorce, as you probably will, since though you and Jane seem to waffle back and forth, I think that is what you want, do it as honestly and compassionately as you can (those two things are not exclusive of each other). If you have a divorce based on deceit, nurtured resentment, and escapism, you are only going to create more hurt for all involved. You see, the irony of everything is that to have the best chance of happiness with someone else, you have to do your personal best to fix your relationship with Karl. And the fact that Dan is in the picture means that it is impossible for you to be doing your best with Karl.

I don't know Dan. He might be a nice guy. He may even be a great guy. But I can tell you with certainty that he's got some serious issues. An emotionally healthy guy will be attracted to and pursue emotionally healthy relationships. Yours is truly all but that. If he were a guy worth keeping, he probably wouldn't have pursued you (or responded to you, whatever the case may be), he certainly wouldn't have gotten emotionally involved with you, and he would have broken things off with you a long time ago. I don't like telling you that, and you probably like hearing it even less... but it is the best, most sincere advice I can give. And believe me, it is much better advice than Jane's ""you need to get out... you need to get out... you need to get out""! It may be true that you need to get out, but how you do it is as important to the health of your future emotional relationships as whether or not you do.

Just so you know, don't worry, I'll never tell Karl about Dan.  That's your baggage.  Your relationship.  And I refuse to get involved.  I don't have the bond of friendhip with Karl that you had with me or Jane.  I won't be the interloper and meddler in your marriage that you have been in mine.

As far as Jane and I are concerned, I love her and hope she finds whatever it is she is looking for. Part of me still hopes she comes to her senses, but fully understand that it is very unlikely that will happen. There is still no doubt in my mind that she will regret all this, which makes me very sad. I feel that a lot of the issues she is trying to escape are not even related to our marriage, and that Ryan is a big fantasy of escapism. I am certain that she is going down a road that is self-destructive and that will not lead at all to happiness. But when this first started my question to her was ""What do you want?"", and let her know that I would respect whatever it is she wants and love her as best I can through that process. I made that commitment to her, and I am doing my best to bring my heart throughout all this. Because it is not about the outcome, its about the process.

Anyway, this has been a long enough note. But I think all this needed to be said. And let me assure you that just like I forgave Jane for the affair and everything, I I've also forgiven you for any role you've had in our breakup -real or imagined on my part.  Having said that, just stay out of my life from now on.

Sincerely,

1308473902.0,824,self.self,i3hjk,My friend is an immigrant working on a cruise ship. This is his horror story.,soleombre,1096,272,268,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/i3hjk/my_friend_is_an_immigrant_working_on_a_cruise/,"My best friend signed a contract to become a crewman on a cruise ship through an Eastern European agency, traveled to Florida with a C1/D visa and started working – the company that runs the cruise line is based in Florida. He is an incredible hard worker, and has been working in the tobacco fields together with his family since he was very young. He accepted this job because he wanted a way out from his country, any way possible, even though the pay for this job was lousy, he accepted the contract. He wasn't however, informed about the disgusting working conditions he finds himself now, and his descriptions of them are what horror movies are made from. Pictures/videos can also be provided. While the obvious solution of his problem is to leave, and lose his very hard earned (and heavily borrowed) investment, the purpose of this text is to see if we can do anything else about it. There are many other immigrants on this corrupt ship (from typically poor regions like India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Eastern Europe), with no voice or no ambition to ask for help. Think you can help? Read on!

Here is everything that he told me about his working conditions:

- We don't have proper drinking water. The shower/tap water is yellow at all times, and it gets brown when the ship is moving, probably with rust from the tanks. The company isn't changing the water filters on time let alone dealing with the problem. When I asked if there's something being done about it, they said I have to buy bottled water from outside, or from the crew bar.

- There's no appropriate drainage in the laundry room where I work. As a result, we regularly get flooded through the drain hole with very toxic water (due to the detergents we use) coming from the washing machines, among other sources. All we can do is use a vacuum cleaner (!!!) to drain it on our own, or notify the engine room people when the water levels get too high so they drain it manually. Bear in mind that the stench is so unbearable when we get flooded, and the dirty water is so toxic that it discolors and corrodes the floor - I can't even imagine what the effects from a prolonged exposure could be on a human being.

- I got ~~electrocuted~~ shocked from a malfunctioning extension cord at my work place and almost nothing was done. The laundry supervisor didn't even report the incident so I had to report it myself! I went to the doctor and all he did was check my pulse, temperature and blood pressure and gave me some sort of vitamin shot, and never explained to me what it was. I kept coming back to his office with complains of pain in my left arm for days, and he said I'm having phantom pains... I got shocked on my left arm and this guy keeps telling me I have phantom pains! He also said that getting shocked with 220 volts of electric current is not dangerous... I'm not sure if this guy even has a medical degree. I'm pretty sure that everything above 50v of DC current can be lethal and this clown is claiming differently! This isn't the only problem I've had with this doctor. I kept telling him I have sleeping issues and he kept telling me to exercise and when I asked him to give me sleeping pills he gave me some pills and he told me to take a double dose. I asked him why, and if there are any side effects of the drug, but he got angry and refused to answer my questions. Another medical issue I developed is blood in my stool, although I am not quite sure what's the cause. Bear in mind that I was totally healthy before I got on this ship.

- The garbage is not collected properly. The garbage is dumped on a giant pile on one of the decks, where there's regularly a collection of disgusting liquid which is not removed properly. The smell is unbelievably bad and there are HUGE numbers of flies all around, including my workplace because of the waste water in the laundry.

- The crew personal rooms are lousy. We have very small cabins with no toilets, and the noisy drone from the ship prevents me from sleeping. The communal bathrooms as I mentioned have yellow water, and the shower cabins get flooded every time someone takes a shower. There's no regularly provided toilet paper, so we have to get it ourselves.

- The food choices for the crew are minimal, containing highly spiced food. Out of the four food choices, two of them are spiced to hell and back making them inedible for me – I've lost weight since I started working, because I mostly eat vegetables and salads. On top of that, even the vegetables and fruits are not fresh many times – yellowed salads, overripe fruits, etc. Drinks such as juice, coffee, milk, tea, etc are not always provided as well. Sometimes the food for the crew is kept heated for days on end, and is served every single day.

- The safety of the crew and the passengers is jeopardized due to faulty rescuing equipment. Part of the equipment is older than 20 years, and the rescue boats have to be manually lowered into the water – which takes a huge amount of time. The crew also doesn't have any life jackets in their cabins, because they are all located on the upper decks. If there is an emergency situation this ship and the crew will not be able to evacuate everybody in time, because the confusion would be enormous which would cause precious time to be lost on tracking down life jackets. A lot of people will die I guarantee you this! There are 300 crewmen and around 700 guests on average. I just hope that nothing will happen.

- I have two alternating shifts. Day shift staring 6am-6pm and night shift 6pm-6am. During the day shift I am allowed to take very few breaks – one for breakfast 7am-7:30am, coffee breaks at 10am-10:15am and 3pm-3:15pm, and one big break from 12pm-1pm. During the night I can take the same amount of breaks whenever I like. In other words, we work 12 hours per day, 7 days a week with no overtime, and no guaranteed free days – we have to ask for a special permission for a day off.

- And now the kicker. We get paid a monthly salary of $450, and perhaps a bit more from the tips that automatically come from the passengers. The tips are obviously not constant because the number of guests is not constant. My contract with this company is for 10 months, because I had no other choice. If I signed for less than 10 months, I would have to cover all the transportation costs for the trip back, but if I stay for 10 months or more the company covers the costs for my trip. Every month, the company withholds a specific amount of money from my salary, until they collect $900 for insurance, so they can cover the transportation costs in case I chose to cancel my contract and leave. The problem is that I do want to leave, but if I do, I would lose a lot of money because I've only made $650 the first two months I was here for example. The first month I made $450, but they paid me only $250 because they held $200 for the insurance. Again, overtime is not paid.

- Many people have tried to sue/report the company before but they have failed. Nobody can do anything to this company! The president of the company is a former coast guard director and has connections all over Miami and nothing can be done about these problems. The USPH and Coast Guard do not pass the inspections as they should. They do not check anything. When others tried to get a lawyer from those maritime advocate firms they could not even get on the ship! I am very vulnerable here. There are no security cameras anywhere on the ship! I fear that something may happen to me if I try to get help from outside! 

tl;dr: There's no way to put this in less words. Please don't downvote because of the length. This is not a troll post. If you do downvote, please explain why, perhaps we could clarify something if needed.

[edit] Here's a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/5kq7h.jpg) of the drainhole in the laundry room where he works.

[edit2] This was a difficult text for me to write. I am writing on behalf of one of my best friends, and while some of his text is left verbatim, I had to rephrase some of it to be better understood, and I also had to translate large portions of it as well. If at any moment the text sounds like it's been written by someone who just finished a giant meal at a top notch restaurant, topped off with an expensive wine – the tone belongs to me, not my friend. Not that I can afford a top notch restaurant, but you get the point.

[edit3] Here's another [picture](http://i.imgur.com/fTmU8.jpg) from the laundry room.

[edit4] His internet access is sporadic, but I will try to get him on here to respond to some of the comments that I can't really address.

[edit5] Whoops, I managed to fall asleep for while, and holy hell, I had no idea this will get so much attention. I'm glad people are upvoting, there's a sense of mutual concern for all these people. Soon we will release the name, alongside with hopefully all kinds of evidence and material, and we'll do it here first.

We've got six full issues now, 60-70 pages each with tons of original content made entirely from the reddit community. No memes, reposts, etc. AMAs turn into readable interviews, most content never hit front page, professional design, guest artists, exclusives, etc. Really cool project.

He's dragging a tyre in the photo because he's in training to do a sponsored walk to the North Pole, to raise money for a charity called TransAid.

Apparently, tying a tyre to your waist and then dragging it around accurately simulates the effort required to drag a sled with all the provisions you need for a two-week journey across the Arctic.

He's 54, and he's in spectacular physical fitness. Over the last few years I've seen him do sponsored hikes up Kilimanjaro and Everest, thousand mile cycles in ten days, marathons and triathlons. I'm 24 years younger than him, and I'm not even slightly as fit as he is.

*Was*, sorry. Got to get used to saying that.

Yesterday, my dad was killed during a training exercise in Britain's Lake District. He slipped on a patch of ice and fell 700 feet into a ravine. By the time the rescue helicopter had arrived, he was already dead.

It seems unfair that he was ready to brave a trek to the North Pole - one of the most inhospitable parts of the planet - but what killed him was a slip and a fall up a hill just 50 miles from his house. A hill that he, and I, and my two younger sisters have climbed together, before.

Apparently I have to go and formally identify the body. Apparently I need to execute his will. Apparently I've got to organise a funeral. Suddenly my life has come to a standstill and a different life has arrived to take its place. I'm suddenly thrust into a world of paperwork and of calling distant relatives. A world of grief and consolation. A world in which the man I admired... the man I called ""dad""... is no longer a part.

I feel woefully inadequate for all of these roles. I just want to phone up my dad and ask for his advice, and have him be there to help me, as he's always been there to help me before. But that's something that I can never do again.

He was convicted of murder. Him and 4 of his friends, armed with knives, approached Luis and 2 of his friends and injured Luis' friends, and fatally wounding Luis in the heart. They outnumbered them, and were armed, and tried to say they acted in self-defense.

Dear Older People: What the Fuck?,,1618,809,366,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ictyu/dear_self_good_job_dear_older_people_what_the_fuck/,"So earlier today I went to Joanne's Fabrics. Not sure how common they are around the rest of the world, or even the United States, but they are simply a chain store for fabrics and sewing supplies on the East coast. While standing in line I noticed a group of elderly women berating the cashier, calling him all sorts of names and essentially ripping into the poor man. Some of their remarks had much to do with his obvious homosexual demeanor. He had the voice and just some of the mannerisms that come with the ""gay"" stereotype. I was at the other register, but it was easy to see he was trying to remain cool and was sweating nervously and quietly taking their abuse. The elderly women finished their purchases and left, and I wasn't far behind them.

I stepped outside and they were still standing in front of the store, making fun of the cashier. At that point I calmly approached the old women and said,

""Excuse me, but I think all three of you need to go inside and apologize. You are adults and have acted extraordinarily childish and rude. I would have expected more from a human being.""

Two of the elderly women actually looked somewhat shocked that I said anything, and even seemed semi-chastened, but one of them indignantly spoke back to me.

""I would have expected more of you to mind your own business punk. It's none of your business what I say and when. You have no right to speak to me in that manner, I will call the cops if I have to.""

I never stopped to continue this conversation, but made my way back to my car, the one old lady who spoke back actually following me. I replied with,

""Ma'am, no matter what preconceived notions you may have about me that may cause you to consider me a 'punk', I would at least never treat another human being the way you treated that man in there, nor would I have insulted or even discussed his sexual orientation. As I said, for an adult you have a lot of growing up to do, now get the fuck away from me.""

At this point she started to call me a series of expletives. I did lose my cool a little bit and called her a bitter old hag as I rolled down my windows (my A/C is broken in my car), but in the end, I was proud of how I confronted her for the things she was saying, even if it was outside of the store and not inside. My intent was never to embarrass anyone, just to point out their actions and recommend that they apologize.

I was happy of my actions, proud even, and told my dad of my semi-heroic actions. After finishing the story he told me,

""They were right, it's none of your business. What do you care what they say to some fag? Next time lay off it.""

I tried to argue that I thought it was the right thing to do to defend any person in that situation, especially someone who is working so they obviously can't defend themselves, but my dad was having none of it.

So you know what? Fuck that. I am proud of myself. Maybe it was none of my business. Maybe I could have even handled the situation a little bit better, or even a lot better. But whatever. I'm glad I at least said something, and even if I didn't make a difference, I didn't just let it go like it it's acceptable. 

.
.
.

TLDR: Old people at store made fun of gay cashier, I stood up to them for the worker, told my dad because I was proud, and was told I shouldn't defend gay people because it isn't my business. Fuck that, go me.

A week ago, someone broke into our house while I was out for the afternoon and stole pretty much everything that I own. Ipod, Ipod touch, Xbox 360, modded 360, and my desktop computer with my 24"" monitors, and a ton of other stuff. Most of the stuff was just material belongings and, although it sucked, completely replaceable. EXCEPT MY COMPUTER. All the documents I ever wrote in college, all my lab reports, all my research, all my pictures, all my music, and all my underwater seahorse porn had been taken from me. I was livid. Someone had taken a serious part of me. I knew that I had a chance to get it back. That one chance was LogMeIn. Once the police had taken their report and left the house, I immediately dusted off the good ol' Pentium 3 from the closet and started hitting refresh. I checked LogMeIn.com every 10 minutes for 4 days. I set my alarm to go off in the middle of the night just to minimize the time elapsed between checks. Then 4 days after my computer was stolen, something magical happened.

My computer turned on. My baby was online! But who had stolen her from me? I waited until 3 AM to strike. I logged on to find my worst nightmare. An idle MySpace window. I cringe at the thought. I logged the ip address and the rest of ipconfig which is exactly when I ran out of ideas. I'm an idiot. I had 4 days to figure out a perfect plan of action, and instead I did nothing but hit refresh. So I did the only thing I could think of. I AskedReddit! I was immediately flooded with great ideas, plans of action, and free software recommendations. I dropped a stealth key logger onto it, installed Prey, and waited for the magic to happen. I also managed to log into the router and nab their SSID and BSSID for their wireless network, which would ultimately lead me to *my precious*. For 2 days, I collected email addresses, names, observed the most atrocious MySpace pages known to man, and sifted through keylogs until I was blue in the face.

Once I finally had compiled an ABSURDLY long list of possible addresses, I outfitted an inconspicuous vehicle and converted it into [WAR CAR!](http://imgur.com/4dx7v.jpg). With the wireless adapter, a laptop, and a network stumbler, I trudged all over the shittiest parts of town, looking to get a hit of the wireless network name and MAC address that I recorded from the stolen computer. After much driving, using peoplefinders.com, sifting through keylogs, and banging my head against the wall, SUCCESS! I matched the SSID and MAC address to a street address I found through whitepages and confirmed in a keylog. This whole process took 3 days.

I turned it into the cops, and two days later, I get a phone call from the detective saying they had got a warrant, searched the house, and confiscated my computer. Not only that, but after they took pictures for evidence, I could have it back tomorrow! Also, the IT guy at the police station 100% called me out this morning because he had been following the thread on reddit. I guess you never know who is actually reading.

1332334062.0,804,self.self,r6nsc,I called 911 this morning and reported a man carrying kitty litter,Thraxbama,1225,421,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/r6nsc/i_called_911_this_morning_and_reported_a_man/,"I work the 11pm to 7am shift at a hotel.  Around 5:45 am I had an old man with hunched over shoulders and an incredibly raspy voice come in carrying a bucket of kitty litter and a carved wooden duck.  Seriously.

He asks me how much for a room for an hour and I told him the truth: we're not that kind of hotel, but if he really needs a room I can give him one for our rack rate which is 99.95/night.  He tells me ""I need a minute to think about it."" and just turns around and stares at a guest I had in the lobby eating breakfast.  A truck driver who's a regular was also in the room and he walked over to get a cup of coffee, shooting me uneasy glances.  The guy waits about a minute or two and then quickly moves over to the truck driver and whispers something to him (I have no idea what since the truck driver left while I was arguing with the guy.)  He pours himself a cup of coffee and then pours cranberry juice in it.  By this time the other guest, the one he had been staring at has stood up and points out the creamer to him and then turns and comes over to me and says ""and I bet you thought you were gonna get through the night without any crazies.""

Then the man started shoving butter in his pockets.

So he turns around and starts trying to argue the price with me, and for reason I still tried to sell him the room but I stayed adamant about the rack rate.  After watching all this I was annoyed so I told him flat out he either needed to pay for a room or get out and he yelled ""I'll leave in a minute!"" and then walked over and started staring at me without blinking for about 30 seconds.

I returned his stare until I realized that I was literally in a staring contest with a grown man and I started laughing and said ""You need to leave, now.""  I picked up the phone, dialed 911 and the nice lady on the other end said ""What service do you need?"" I said ""police"" and he freaked out.  He started pointing at himself and was like ""Me?!  You called the police on me?!"" And when I just responded with ""yeah"" he ran grabbed his bucket of kitty litter and carved duck and ran out of the hotel.

I don't know how many of you have ever gotten to call the police and give a description of someone but when you say to the man on the other end ""He's an older male, wearing a USMC hat, fatigue pants, speaking with a very raspy voice and carrying a tub of kitty litter and a wooden duck"" there is the most awkward pause ever on the other end of the line.  

tl;dr it was probably a mallard

I went to an onsite to help out an old guy who couldn't get Internet access. I don't do onsites, but there was a scheduling issue, so I figured I'd just knock it out real quick and make my 89 bucks.

Old guy answers the door and I started working on his system. He was annoying and distracting as hell, talking at length about his sexual conquests, how he flew to Asia every year and spent a week with prostitutes, how the best shower he had was with a 17 year old Asian prostitute, how perfect her tits were, etc. I just wanted him to STFU and let me finish (Nortan had fucked up his stack, btw and I fixed his system by removing it).

A buddy of mine was in from out of town and he helped by distracting the old bastard, who wouldn't just shut the fuck up. On and on he spewed graphic details about the truly stratospheric number of Asian prostitutes he'd fucked and finally mentioned that he had significant health issues stemming from his time over there. My buddy asked him what he had done over there, and it turned out he was in the Army and had been captured in Viet Nam, then spent 3 years in a POW camp being tortured.

Wait, wat? 3 fucking years? I couldn't help but stop what I was doing and instead of seeing an annoying old guy, I saw a broken man who, some 40 years earlier had done more than I will ever do, had suffered more than I will ever suffer, and had somehow managed to make it through, heavy reliance on Asian prostitutes notwithstanding.

He continued on in equally graphic detail telling us what they had done to him. I wanted to throw up. They fucking broke him. It was horrible. And somehow, he made it through it, although he was unable to have any semblance of a relationship after. His wife left him. His friends left him. He lives alone now, in the twilight of his life and all he has left is the hookers.

Yeah, I didn't charge him. When he asked me why, I told him he already spent 3 years paying and there was no fucking way I was going to charge him again.

So I left there feeling like an asshole and wondering how many other people I've snap-judged and if I'd just had a little more information I would have shut my arrogant mouth and felt a little goddam compassion.

You will find this stupid picture on EVERY fucking page at least 50 times. But wait, what do we find when we insert that link into Tineye?

http://hairdohairstyles.com/HairStylePictures/displayimage.php?album=26&amp;pos=4

Tadaaaaaa! Isn't that weird? Only one picture of her seems to exist and it can also be found in a larger version on a hairstyle website. Hmmm. I wonder, if someone is just hiding behind that picture. If not, I'm sure this could easily be settled by her posting a picture of herself with a shoe on her head, problem solved.

But hiding behind someone else's face is her problem. What's our problem is that she is telling gullible people that they should drink something which could very well hurt their bodies. Linkdump of all information I could find on Hydrogen Peroxide:

There's evidence of carcinogenicity of hydrogen peroxide to mice administered high concentrations in their drinking water: http://u.nu/46sud

Results suggest that bone-loss in estrogen deficiency is caused by hydrogne peroxide http://u.nu/8urud

The ACGIH has classified hydrogen peroxide as an animal carcinogen: http://u.nu/4hrud

Tumor promotion in rat liver cells: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10190566

Hydrogen Peroxide Stimulates Proliferation and Migration of Human Prostate Cancer Cells: http://u.nu/7drud

Vitamin C prevents cancer by BLOCKING hydrogen peroxide: http://u.nu/5crud

The main factor in cigarette smoke that causes cancer is called hydrogen peroxide: http://www.physorg.com/news123408747.html

http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/541868 July 28, 2006 -- The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a health advisory to warn consumers against the purchase and ingestion of high-strength hydrogen peroxide products for medicinal purposes due to the risk for serious harm or death. http://www.aegis.com/pubs/atn/1991/ATN13206.htmlResearchers at Stanford University have told AIDS TREATMENT NEWS that hydrogen peroxide has been found to stimulate growth of HIV in laboratory tests. Apparently it does this by affecting the complex systems of chemical messengers which control cell (and viral) growth. A second laboratory has confirmed much of the initial findings.

Adults are already getting seriously harmed by accidentally ingesting this crap: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2658134/ Imagine what happens to children exposed to this.

In other words, we know it doesn't work, and it's actually illegal to sell on-line with all these health claims.

But it gets worse. She(?) is squeezing people dry with this bullcrap. On her site she asks $180 for a gallon of 35% hydrogen peroxide. I can buy 50 gallon of 35% hydrogen peroxide for only $399 here: http://www.groworganic.com/item_PSA860_Hydrogen_Peroxide__35_Food_Grade.htmlThat's 8 dollar a gallon. A little cheaper than $180 frigging dollar for one gallon. And that's her cheapest offer. A quarter gallon is 100 dollar. But in her defense, you also get a ""manual"", and her ""consultation"" for a year. What does the manual say? I have no idea, it's 30 bucks. 30 bucks to explain to you how to dilute a carcinogen and drink it.

What do you think Reddit, can we put our internet-nerd superpowers to good use for a change? Can people bug the FDA about this for example, since it's illegal? Can people help get the message out there that it's dangerous? Please help prevent people from getting hurt by this!

**UPDATE 1:** 

I'm not American, I can't call the FDA. I'll send an e-mail to them though to see if they'll take action.

This is her twitter account, which she uses to advertise her product: http://twitter.com/lynnegordon If you have twitter, send her some tweets with studies showing what hydrogen peroxide really does, I'm sure she'll thank you for them. Ask her politely to stop selling this product for her own good, and the safety of the poor people buying it.

Majid83 has found some more information on what Hydrogen Peroxide really does to the body, as a free-radical it is involved in aging:

Thanks Majid.
This is why it causes premature aging to the skin when you apply it to the skin, which you should never do.

**UPDATE 2:**

Good advice from wesleyh: ""Can't you contact the host, domain registrar and/or paypal? It is illegal and they should respond to something like this."" I mailed the FDA, waiting for a response now. 
You can email the FDA too at [this link](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/ReportaProblem/ucm059315.htm) and at this [link](http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/email/oc/oci/contact.cfm.).

Lynne Gordon also offers an interesting pdf file on her website:

http://oxygentherapyprogram.com/Chapter1.pdf (Right-click, save as, on my old computer it makes it freeze if I open it in Firefox)

This is some insane stuff. This seems to be part of the $30 dollar manual you have to pay for.

August 28th, 1988 - December 4th, 2008

I first took notice of you in Chemistry, 11th grade. You were the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes on. I was the luckiest kid in the world when we were chosen to be lab partners by the teacher. I was pretty nervous though, you being captain of the Volleyball team and all I did was sit on the bench on the varsity basketball team and play video games.

However, we wasted no time in getting to know each other. We both loved the same movies, music, we had an almost identical view on life, except for religion. We became best friends. After only two weeks of meeting you, I knew I was in love.

We spent every day together. We went to prom together. I remember everyone saying ""Them two are going to get married one day"". We were both infatuated with love; but terrified. When we graduated, you were going to college in Virginia, but it was still amazing.

We couldn't let go of each other. We held hands and kissed everywhere. I remember it as if it just happened today. Your car, my room, starbucks, the park. Anywhere and everywhere we went, which was a lot of places because we were with each other every single day.

I never had a girl as beautiful as you, so it meant a lot to me that you were so into me. You called me every morning, you always called first. ""Morning babe, I just woke up. Come over in a half an hour, I have to take a shower first, then we'll go to school and hang out all day afterwords"". I remember those phone calls, and that voice, to the tee.

I still smile when I remember coming home to your parent's house that one morning at 6am. Your cars brakes went out so we ""borrowed"" your dad's car to go party one night. Your dad was getting ready for work, but we snuck in un-noticed. When he came home from work that night, he asked you why there were footprints on the windshield and the headliner...hahaha. We played it off like we had no idea what he was talking about and he completely bought it.

I remember when you went off to college 300 miles away, and I was a few months away from going to the Marines. We decided to split up before we went seperate ways. Even though it was on good terms, I regret it. Regret; I have a lot.

I was with Ashley at the time, but you were always in the back of my mind. We still talked every day. I still believe to this day if you hadn't gone away, we would still be together and I never would have joined the military, but that's what happened and there's nothing I can do about it now.

Ashley cheated on me when I was in boot camp, and you were right there waiting. I remember talking to you on the phone when I was nearing graduation and telling you about it. That's when you told me you're moving back down to Carlisle and going to school locally. I've never heard better news to this day.

I fell in love all over again (as if it ever left). We pulled it together and dealt with the long distance, but it wasn't that bad. We sent each other letters, cards, mix cd's, bumper stickers, pictures and NES cartridges (haha!). That summer, things were better than ever. I came home almost every weekend. You came to North Carolina on the weekends I didn't. I wouldn't even tell friends or family I was coming, because the only person I wanted to spend the short time I had at home was with you.

We would always joke how we were ""engaged to be engaged"". All of your friends were mad at you because they didn't get to see you as much as I did. All of my friends didn't even know I was in town. We were perfect, and in love.

I remember you would come over to my Mom's house and we would just play video games all day. You would always try to get a higher score than me in Counter-Strike, but it would never happen. We would play over and over, just chillin' and enjoying each other. I remember when I got put on IRR and got to come home for 6 months. I seen you every day I wasn't with my friends. You would call me every day at noon and we would get lunch between your classes. Sometimes I would pretend to be sleeping, and miss your call on purpose. Again; regret.

I had always thought I knew what ""love"" was until I met you, and having you, who made me feel things on a level I'd never known before. Who stayed with me even though we were 2,000 miles apart for 9 months during my first deployment to Iraq. Torn from me abruptly, I went completely insane. Like cheesy love movie insane.

It was early November. I never tell the full story to anyone, I would break down typing all of the details. That night is burned into my mind for eternity, and it haunts me every day. You picked me up in the morning, we hung out at your apartment all day, then we took off for a night out in town. We went bar hopping in Franklin, they let me drink underage with my Military ID. I believe 5 of your friends were there as well, but it might have been 6.

We left at close. We were driving home. I had too much and I couldn't drive for you, but if I could take that back I would drive in a heartbeat. We drove into an intersection and a drunk driver came from the left, ran a red light, and smacked into the driver's side door. I was horrified. Ironically, this drunk driver could have saved your life.

You were in pain, but you were okay. I stayed at the hospital as much as I could. Unfortunately, I was not there when the hardest part of it all happened. I missed one of your phone calls because I was playing football with some friends (we played every Thursday). When I checked my voicemails you were on there. You said they found brain tumors, and there was nothing they can do. You said the doctor's are giving you three weeks to live. You wished me the best, said I love you, and hung up. I choked up. I was in tears. I couldn't even call back, I couldn't even hear the message again. I wanted to be dreaming. I wanted this to not be real. I couldn't even call you back, I was speechless. I deleted the message, but I wish I could hear your voice one more time.

I called back three days later. For three days, I didn't leave my room. I was a ghost. I talked to no one, I answered no phone calls. Why did I wait three days? I guess it was too hard, but that's no excuse. I got to talk to you and come see you a few more times. I will never forget our last conversation; our last words to each other. Why did I wait three days to come see you? That's three more days I could have had with you. Again; regret.

You passed away the morning of the 4th of December, in the hospital. I didn't get to talk to you that day. I will forever remember the 4th of December as losing the greatest love I have ever known. Losing a best friend. Losing my other half. I have never been the same person since that day, and I never will be. I hide my emotions. Even though I think about it each and every day. You're always on my mind, and it sucks.

Your funeral was hard. I couldn't stay the whole time. I left with your friend Christina. She dropped me off at home, gave me a hug and said everything will be okay...but it never was. I wish it was. I miss you and I still love you so much.

Usually guys keep things like this bottled inside of them, but I don't care anymore. I don't care about the macho man stereotypes. I have nothing to prove.

I'm moving on now, two years later, but it's hard. I find girls from time to time. I've had relationships. I feel affection for them. I've been in a form of love with one of them. I'm living the life of outstretched hands and one night stands it seems, and I hate it. I've moved on, I just wish I didn't have to. What are the chances of someone finding ""the one"" twice in a single, short lifetime?

But they're so different. I don't fill with pride when I make them laugh, and they don't really care about making me laugh. And not once have I left the room to get something to drink and returned to a dark room with the tv off and them naked under the covers, Joe Budden playing on the stereo. You never understood why I loved his music so much.

I wish we could cross paths again, but that's impossible. While I'm here listening to depressing music, feeling sorry for myself, you're somewhere looking down on me telling me to move on. Although I'm an Atheist and you've always hated that, even though you couldn't argue back. If your heaven does exist and I was wrong, you're probably laying down up there with your grandmother, who passed away only four months before you did. But not too close, because you have restless leg syndrome and need your space. I always tried to respect that, and I'm sure she does too.

But it's 1:54AM and I'm punching out this rambling text, because I haven't talked to my best friend in two years and I don't feel things as intensely as I once did. I'm starting to feel love for another woman again, but I doubt she feels the same way. It will never be the same. Every day is the same boring shit, it feels like life is such a chore... but it used to be our playground. I love you Jackie, I hope you're resting in peace. It just sucks that I don't sleep well anymore.

EDIT: Thank you all for the replies! It means a lot. And for those who think I'm a troll, you're absolutely ridiculous. I hope you ALL find the love I found. And yes...it is pure irony that the drunk driver could have saved her life...but he did get what he deserved.

As a side note for the people saying I am a great writer - thank you. I've been working on a novel for quite some time..but it's going to take longer than Brian's (from Family Guy) to complete.

Prior to the musician's popularity, I really liked my name.

After seeing the Michael Bolton AMA, it sparked a little bit of frustration that I am living the Office Space Michael Bolton Syndrome.  I saw Office Space long before the musician Chris Brown ever gained popularity and I remember laughing so hard at that whole Michael Bolton joke.  I remember thinking ""man I'm glad my name is Chris Brown, it's too dull to ever be the name of a famous anything."" 

Fast forward to today, I couldn't have asked for a worse representation of my name in public media.  I work in software development and whenever I meet new clients... just think Office Space/Michael Bolton but with the added nuance of domestic violence.  Splendid.

My name is Chris Brown, and I live with the negative connotation someone else puts on my name every day.  I'm at the point where I'm seriously considering legally changing it... but wait... I'm older, I had it first, shouldn't he?

A few people were standing around the scene, but didn't do anything. Everytime I saw something like this on the news, I thought ""what would I do?"". They say you should gather a few bystanders, because most people want to help, but don't dare to do it alone. So that's what I did. I asked a young man to help me.  

I saw the old man dropped his wallet, and I thought picking it up was a good excuse to go stand between him and his younger attacker. The attacker seemed shocked that somebody dared to come between them. He threatened to attack the old man again, but generally backed off... The other bystander that I asked for help went to talk to him, I took aside the old man, gave him his wallet and told him to walk away, to the police and to a doctor (he was bleeding on his head). In the mean time, the young man was distracted and kind of let go, didn't really pay attention to the old man. The old man was clearly in shock. Another bystander came to us and took his arm and they started walking in the direction of the police station. The old man turned around and thanked me. 

I was so shocked that I simply walked home. I could hardly open the door, because I was shaking so hard that I couldn't get the key in... 

I don't know... just wanted to et this off my chest, but nobody's picking up the phone... 

EDIT TO ADD: Thank you guys for your nice reactions. But the truth is, I'm not a particullarly good person, and I'm not to be thanked or praised. I know that I would react the same if I would read this, but reading your lovely comments feels so strange. I don't feel like I did anything. It was an automatic pilot, if that makes any sense. Everything during and now after feels so surreal. I think it's the adrenalins fault, but it feels like I wasn't really there... I don't know, maybe someone can explain this better, everything feels very strange... And to the person who gave me gold: you made this even more surreal.

The Chief was out on another call on my street; was parked when he noticed our dog in the back yard.  Could not find license info so he left the note.

Also, he noted the tall weeds and thought they might be a fire hazard when the weather turns hot.  My son told him of my back surgery and the Chief said not to worry ... we're covered.

They also spoke of the neighbor who threatened to shoot my dogs right after I moved in.  He said: ""Wow!  Welcome to the neighborhood, huh?""  He said to call him anytime if the old man ever says anything like that again and he would take care of it.  

This was not personal; just a man doing his job.  He also said that he leaves his cards with notes all the time and 99% of the people never contact him.

I just wanted to share what it's like dating a person with a disability, in this case, blindness. 

Anyways, we've been together for a month and a few days now. Everything has been great so far. We've gone out on the town and done some ""normal"" stuff. The hardest part is picking activities to do. Mini-golf and bowling don't work so much. So far, we've gone to a theatre to see Les Miserables, Disneyland, and to the LA Zoo (thank yous to the person who suggested a zoo). I try to find things with a lot of noise or action bits.

She's just like any other girl I've dated except I have to pay a bit more attention to what she's doing. You know, in case she walks under a piano dangling over a ledge. She is also big on touching, like holding hands, even when we are sitting down at a restaurant to eat. Normally, I would find that hampering and annoying but I understand where it's coming from. So overall, it's been great so far.

My first response was positive, knowing that it is a step up professionally and that it will open up a new world of opportunity for him. Great.

Since the news dropped, it has been difficult for me to be happy. My best friend of 7 years and former roommate is now gone. It is a similar feeling to that of 3 years ago when the largest portion of our select group of friends graduated and moved away. My lasting consolation then was that at least I still have my best friend.

Many people laugh and criticise Bromance like it is a silly thing, that couldn't be further from the truth. A good friend is always hard to find. Their love for you is not unconditional but it is certainly earned, which makes it all the more valuable and harder to let go.

The moments and experiences shared between me and my best buddy have often been obnoxious, secretive, deviant, and life altering. I think what I will miss most is our enabling affect on each other and all of the trouble that has lead us to.

1286338986.0,747,self.self,dnf2x,I tried stand-up for the first time... At my dad's funeral.,fonetik,1280,533,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dnf2x/i_tried_standup_for_the_first_time_at_my_dads/,"This is the speech I told recently at my father's funeral.  I went up at the very end of the service so people could leave with a smile, just like my dad would have wanted. 

I killed with it.  Dad would have loved it.  I hope you all do too.

---------------

When you’re a child, you learn a lot of incredible things.  Your mind is blown on a regular basis.  What goes up, must come down.  What cold is and what hot is.  What you can do and what you can’t do.  The earth goes around the sun.  What family means.  What it means to love them.

As you get older, these grand realizations get further and farther between.  Learning how an engine works.   What government does.  The difference between a pay rate and a pay check.  Then pretty soon, you just don’t have any of those moments anymore.

Then, a moment comes around that rearranges your entire universe.  It’s the opposite of all the previous realizations.  Instead of knowing the cause but not the effect, you’re aware of the inevitable but completely unprepared for the outcome.

September 13th was that moment for me. 

 

My dad was the greatest man I’ve ever met.  I would frequently hear people who knew him tell me “You are just like your father”.  I would only be able to muster out something about how I was far more handsome than him, which is clearly true... but was mostly for comedic effect.  But what I’d always wanted to tell them was how much of a compliment I believed that to be.  However, an affliction that my dad and I both have intervened:  We love making people laugh during uncomfortable situations.

We would argue all the time about politics.  His crazy ultra-right wing lock up the borders and give guns to invalids talk against my rhythm-nation common man Marxist rants.  We would battle for hours, spouting statistics, proposing scenarios.  We both loved it.  And after hours of dogged fighting, either we would realize that we were both basically arguing the same point, or my mom would come in and scream at us both to shut up.

But, like I said, if there’s any one thing that my dad and I shared, besides this breathtaking visage, it was our love for making people laugh.  Thanksgiving dinner was a time to get everyone together and doing the other thing we both truly loved…  making fun of my mom.  Whether it was the smoke alarm signaling that whatever was in the oven was ready, or trying to have her remember a joke or read something aloud.  We had a blast with it.  I hope all of you will pick up where my dad and I left off and ask my mom to tell a joke or read anything aloud.  And don't feel too bad.  You can tease her all you want, she won't remember anyways.

I'm not sure exactly when it happened, but after I heard, I started thinking of jokes.  It's a defense mechanism.  It's what we did with bad news.  They were how he made others feel at ease, so it's only fitting that I attempt to make you all laugh uncomfortably.  If any of these really do make you feel uncomfortable, just know that my dad would think they are funny.

So here I am... doing exactly what my father would have been proud of me for:  Milking this bereavement time for all that it’s worth! 

I'm not sure exactly what my dad died from.  Something called a myocardial infarction, whatever that is.  I'm pretty sure it actually happened because he finally found the chain-email that he didn’t send that threatened something terrible would happen the next day if he didn't forward it.  Ether that or did someone told him that Obama got a second term.  For both of you that don't know, my dad was a diehard Republican and gun nut.  He MAY have mentioned it.  If the cable news was out for more than a hour, he didn't have opinions anymore.  Actually, now that I think of it, this may have just been his way out of getting Social Security. 

We always joked that I'd be changing his diapers when he’s old.  I'd say ""I'll have people for that by then"".  Turns out I won't have to do that indignity for my parents.  That means you too mom.  If anyone knows a good nursing home, we're going to need one for my mom...  really soon too. 

*Pats stomach*  I grew this gut just for this occasion.  That's just like normal...  Everyone laughs at that joke but my dad.  Only kidding...  of course my dad went to the gym steadfastly, once every nine months.

He was also right in the middle of refinishing the cabinets in the kitchen.  I guess he REALLY didn’t want to have to finish those.  We will add this to the list of unfinished projects.

I probably could have been a really great rockstar.  But my picture perfect upbringing from loving parents ruined all of that.  I couldn't get any rage from anywhere!  What could I possibly be mad at?  Scream about my mom and dad still chasing each other around like schoolkids?  All that gross kissing and hugging?  Or their hilarious little fights where they weren't talking to each other? 

Here's some things that I've always wanted to say in front of my Dad but never could:
Ronald Reagan wasn't that great.  
Sarah Palin is an idiot.
There's probably some rap music that you'd like. 
The warranty plan is almost never worth it.
You won't ever need that receipt.  
You don't need that manual.  
You'll never send in that warranty card.  
The neighborhood kids are not stealing your internet. 

All bourbon tastes the same to me.  I always thought you were faking it when you could taste the difference.

A law banning giving infants loaded guns is not a ""Slippery slope"".

I never really liked watching football, I just liked watching it with you.

I'd like everyone to remember who my dad was.  He would be the one making you laugh right now if he saw you crying. 

*While crying*  Excuse me, I was backstage cutting some onions.

It began this time with her being upset about trying to find work - a valid stressor in life. After a day of job hunting she set out to get annihilated drunk.

Not tonight. She threw herself at the door hollywood styles, ripping the door trimming and the handle off the wall.. and pile drived me into the wall backwards off my seat. Leaving an enormous hole in the wall of the rental property we have together. All the while shouting I was a worthless POS that will never provide for her as well as her ex did.

One call to the police later and she was taken away as per her record for domestic violence. Yes, I am a dumbass for hanging around..

She will be taken to the police station, questioned, then accommodated in a block of units nearby for 'women in distress'. This has happened the previous times. It seems to be protocol.

Had things gone differently, had I retaliated and ripped the bedroom door off it's hinges and pushed her through the wall if it were her who isolated herself away from me, I can guarantee I would not be given a nice motel for the night courtesy of 'men in distress' - I would be in a cell and charged.

Actual things that happened to me in school, and the lessons ive learned 

by RJ 

**Kindergarten** - A waterbug popped up through the sink drain. It was really scary looking and everyone crowded around to look at it. Suddenly, it ran up the side of the drain and everyone screamed and it fell on my shoe. I shook my foot and crushed it... and the teacher yelled at me for it. 

Lesson: Bug = good. 

**1st grade** - Mr. Brescher the gym teacher had us line up one day because we had to go to the nurse. I asked him why and he said ""to get a big shot with a needle thiiiis big"" and demonstrated how long the needle was. I got scared. Not because i was scared of shots, but because my mom always told me I was NOT supposed to get shots in school. I started to cry, and he just laughed and kept asking me if I was scared. I explained my situation to him, and he said ""Oh no, you're definately gonna get a needle"". I cried more. 

Lesson: Crying 6 year old = prime chance to fuck with someone's head. 

**1st grade two** - Mr. Mcnelly had a table set up on parent-teacher night with instruments on it. Random kids were playing with the instruments. When I went to pick up the maracas, Mr. Mcnelly snatched them away. Other kids continued to play with other instruments, but he withheld the maracas. My dad talked with him for a bit, and at the end of their conversation Mr. Mcnelly said ""Why dont you show us how to play the maracas, rj."" I took them, and shook them once, before he snatched them away again. 

Lesson: I'm not allowed to play maracas. Ever. 

**2nd grade** - I was at the urinal peeing, and Drew was at the urinal next to me. He swung around and peed all over my leg and screamed ""Ta-Da!"". When we went to the principal as a result of this, Drew's excuse was ""I was just trying to pee on the floor, like RJ did at cub scouts!"" (Yes, I used to pee in the drain in the bathroom floor at cub scouts). *I* got detention for my friend pissing on my leg, because I ""set a bad example"".

Lesson: At age 7, you should be setting examples for your friends, or else you're fucked 

**2nd grade two** - I had just learned the word ""lesbian"" and I thought it was funny, even though I had no idea what it meant. Outside in gym class, as I threw a hula hoop in the air, I triumphantly yelled out ""LESBIAN!"". the teacher sent me to the principal, who gave me detention for disturbing classes by yelling ""made up words"". 

Lesson: Lesbian is a made up word. 

**3rd grade** - Drew, Jorge and I would make paper dolls and call them ""suicide men"". We'd draw sad faces on them, and then kill them in certain ways (such as drowning them in the water fountain), and then we'd swear it was their own doing because, after all, they were *suicide men*. One girl told on us, and then the teacher asked if we thought that suicide was funny. We said yes, and she said ""Good, you were honest. Don't do it again"" and we didn't get in trouble. 

Lesson: joking about suicide at a young age is okay, as long as you are open with the fact that death can be humorous. 

**3rd grade two** - In math class, for some reason we were learning about the White House (in math!). The teacher kept making a point of saying how the rooms had been ""Untouched since the 1700s"" and that everything was very old. I raised my hand and asked if they had a TV in the white house. The teacher called me an idiot and got very, very angry. 

Lesson: They have a TV in the white house. 

**4th grade** - Every thursday was ""CLUB DAY"", a day where we would have two classes and spend the rest of the day in our ""clubs"" which we would sign up for at the beginning of the year. We were alloted two hours for each club. I signed up for a swimming club called ""splish splash"". Every thursday we would get on a bus with the rest of the suburban white kids, and they would drive us to school #1, which was in the absolute heart of the ghetto. We would then proceed to go in the locker rooms and change into our swimsuits. The kids in the locker room would yell and scream and rap in our faces and spit at us and scare us. Then we'd get to the pool, and they'd teach us how to swim. I had been on the swim team for years at this point, and i knew every stroke and could swim perfectly. We'd spend 20 minutes doing the doggie paddle, then we would return to the locker room and get scared some more, before driving back to school all wet. 

Lesson: School is fucking ridiculous. 

**4th grade two** - One day in the winter, they made all the kids go outside without their jackets. We sat out there for three hours, freezing, then we went back inside. The teachers wouldn't tell us why we were outside, and when I asked, I was told to ""mind my own business... they probably just needed us out of there so they could wax the floors... or someth- Y'KNOW RJ, DON'T ASK SO MANY Guuuhhh~ derrn~ QUESTIONS!"". Later i found out that we were outside because there was a bomb threat made to our school. 

Lesson: Don't question anything, ever. 

**5th grade** - I was biting into my hamburger at school, when I felt something hard. I realized it was a tooth as I pulled it out of my mouth. I checked ... nope, not my tooth. I took it to the lunch aide, who told me it was mine. I told her it wasn't mine. She told me it was. I told her I found it in my hamburger, and it wasn't my tooth, because I had all mine. She told me to go show it to the lunchlady. I did. She said it was mine. I told her it wasn't, and explained the situation. She said ""hrm"" and took the tooth and put it in an envelope. She said she don't see how any tooth other than mine could be in a hamburger. I went back and sat down again. Never found out what a tooth was doing in my hamburger.

Lesson: If the lunchlady says so, it's your tooth. No matter what. 

**5th grade two** - Jorge was in the school play, Annie Get Your Gun. He had the male lead. When me and Drew went to see the play, we sat in the back and watched it quietly and respectfully with our parents. The next day, the acting teacher called me immature, and asked why I couldn't even keep quiet during my friend's play. When I was confused, she said ""WELL... maybe you should have been **in** the play, because you can certainly act confused well enough. You know what you did""... and then she wouldnt listen anymore. 

Lesson: Do not show support for your friends by going to their shows. 

**5th grade three** - We were going to perform with the chorus at Woodbridge Mall. I was singing this Hanukkah song ""Bashana"" in rehearsal when I felt lightheaded. Next thing I know, I'm in the bathroom with water all over me. Singing ""Bashana"" had caused me to pass out, and the teacher had rushed me to the bathroom to splash water on me. The nurse gave me some juice, and sent me to the mall. When it was time to preform the song at the mall, the teacher said she didnt want me to sing it, because I might pass out again. I sang every other song fine, but had to make a scene by edging my way out of the risers before Bashana. 

Lesson: Hebrew songs affect me like kryptonite.

**6th grade** - Taking the advice of my teacher, I joined the school play. I got one of the male leads, along with Jorge. When they were doing makeup, I jokingly said ""I want mutton chops!"". The fat teacher said ""You got it"" and started to draw mutton chops on my face with a damn makeup pencil. It hurt like hell, and I didn't actually want mutton chops, so I stopped him and said I was kidding. Then the director came up and glared at me, and said I looked ridiculous. To remedy the situation, she had fat teacher now draw a full beard on me with makeup pencil. I looked even more ridiculous, and hurt myself scrubbing the makeup off later. 

Lesson: Just accept mutton chops, or else. 

**6th grade two** - We were all rushed outside once again, in the cold. We sat there for half of the day, and even missed lunch. Hungry and freezing, Jorge and I decided to ask the teacher what was going on. She told us that someone had thrown up inside, and the janitors were working on cleaning it. We reminded her jokingly that we were capable of rational thought at this point in our lives, and that answer didn't really make sense. She said ""well, that's what they told the teachers... I don't know what to te ll you."" 

Lesson: Don't trust anyone. ",,False,,t5_2qh96,1349127197.0,,,True,t3_10o2xq,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/10o2xq/when_i_graduated_from_hs_over_ten_years_ago_i/,

I have PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder. According to my therapists and doctors throughout the years, I'm a very ""special case"". I first attempted suicide at nine. Shit's not fun bro. Recently, (I'm very open about my past and the fact that I have these illnesses on Tumblr and the like) I have gotten messages from anonymous assholes stating this like ""self-involved"" and ""playing the victim"". I confess that sometimes I do this, because sometimes, even if you are going to therapy and taking medication, you have off days. The most insulting thing to me though? Was the use of quotation marks around ""disorders"". Here's the deal: My mental illnesses are as real as the wheelchair I use to get around. My PTSD has me in a constant fight or flight mode sometimes. I first started showing signs of PTSD at sixteen. Since then, I am less violent. I no longer snap at the small things. My Depression stops me in my tracks sometimes. I have been in the hospital twice for mental health reasons and while you're there no one sends you a get well card, and your mom doesn't answer the phone when you call. No one points out the fact that you sleep all day and don't eat. Everyone knows that something is off, but it can't be Depression. You're just in a ""funk"". It can't be PTSD, it must be your Irish temper.

The day that the most recent school shooting occurred, I got another anonymous message stating that ""It's people like you that kill innocent children."" Being called crazy hurts. Being inferred as dangerous just fucking burns. 

Just because I am open about the fact that I have these illnesses, these challenges does not mean I'm trying to play the martyr or that I'm just sitting on my ass feeling sorry for myself. I know that being open about it starts a dialogue, but recently I wanted to silence myself. To just keep it quiet due to the hate that I have gotten.

However, watching your recent video with the vlogbrothers and rereading your blog post about your personal struggle made me realize that I am doing the right thing. Thank you for inadvertently giving me a pep-talk.

Stay awesome!

**EDITED TO ANNOUNCE**: Just noticed that Wil's response to my letter is in /r/bestof.

(Regarding yesterday's IAmA thread),,996,269,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/sgaka/dont_trust_dropshipredditor_regarding_yesterdays/,"Note -- I'm going to go ahead and delete my account now (it was a throwaway and I have no use for it now that we've solved the mystery).

UPDATE (4/19/2012): DropshipRedditor just sent me reddit gold. Here is a copy of the message exchange. He still hasn't explained anything.

DropshipRedditor's message to me:
&gt;I'm going through all the haters one by one and send them all some Reddit Gold.. So here's yours.

&gt;FYI.. I send Drunken_Economist SO much proof it's ridiculous. He did an excellent job Moderating and making sure I was legit.

&gt;I sent him screenshots of ALL my admins with monthly and yearly sales for each site. Then I uploaded a page with his name and Reddit logo on every site as well. I even showed him my Adwords account that proved my $30k monthly PPC spend on those exact sites.

&gt;What more could you ask for dude?

My response:

&gt;&gt;Your name is listed on a consumer reports website where a handful of customers have filed complaints against you for stealing their money over the past few years. You blatantly lied about your identity and pretended that ""TwitterBirdMarketing"" and ""EthicalSEOFirm"" were business associates of yours, when in fact they are actually you. Can you explain these anomalies?

&gt;&gt;It's been 48 hours and you've completely avoided these questions. Sending out reddit gold isn't going to make things better. I'm not out to destroy your reputation. I'm not trying to judge you. I'm not even questioning whether or not you make $100k/yr. Heck, you could make $100k/yr and still be a liar. I'm just wondering why you're trying to scam redditors out of their money.

----------

EDIT (4/18/2012): Thanks to the excellent detective work of BananaMoustache, COW_GO_MOO, and V3rtigo, I believe we have enough evidence to state with confidence that DropshipRedditor is full of shit. I was not surprised to read reports of him swindling thousands of dollars out of unsuspecting people over the past few years.

It's unfortunate that my original (duplicate) thread on /r/WTF was removed by the mods. It had significantly more exposure than this one due to the larger viewership of that subreddit. But them's the rules.

Anyway, now that we've gotten to know each other, I'd like to tell you guys about how I make over $500,000 a month by working from home! I've been investing in fiscal quarterly cash flows on the bull market for penny stocks! And so can you!

----------

Here's the story.

Yesterday, DropshipRedditor made a post on IAmA saying ""I make $100k per month running online shops!"" and garnered LOTS of attention. 3000+ comments, many more votes. He was confirmed by multiple mods/admins, and may very well be a legitimate businessman.

This is the thread in question: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/se78n/i_make_over_100k_per_month_running_dropship/

He spent the entire day answering questions and promised to compile all the information into a brief how-to guide, including ""recommended software, analytics, and marketing tools"". Seemed like a really generous thing to do. Many people expressed their gratitude and said that DropshipRedditor had inspired them to start their own businesses.

Here's where it gets sketchy: He published the how-to guide, at the end of which he listed three ""tools"":

Ecommerce software: www.volusion.com

SEO and PPC help: EthicalSeoFirm@gmail.com (""honest guys who can rank anything"")

Twitter Marketing: TwitterBirdMarketing@gmail.com (""Twitter geniuses, they handle all my accounts"")

The first one may be a legitimate company, but the last two do not seem to exist. If these are such great companies, why don't they have websites? Why do they use gmail accounts? Why does a google search for said gmail accounts turn up ZERO RESULTS?

My first thought was that this guy is trying to lure people in with claims of riches and grandeur, only to swindle them out of their money for his ""SEO"" and ""Twitter"" services. I just don't see how a company full of ""Twitter geniuses"" doesn't have a website. Or a twitter account.

Maybe there is some reasonable explanation, and if so, I apologize. I just don't want to see people throwing away their savings. If DropshipRedditor can adequately explain these anomalies, I'll delete this thread.

Im 38 my son is 18. We have never lived together. We rarely speak. A couple days ago he messaged me and told me he is gay and he has chosen a partner. His partner is black and 19.

He says his partners parents tried to beat the gay out of him. His mother is quite wealthy and very Christian. He cant stay there. My son asked me if they can come stay with me and of course I said yes, Ive always said yes. I talked about it with my wife, I was thoroughly let down. This is my best friend and partner of 4 years saying she doesnt want to be around my gay son.. It hurts to have to choose like this, but I think its the right choice.

I sure hope im doing the right thing. But I know a couple things, I know reddit will be there for me if everything goes to shit.

I wrote this crying Im sorry it wasnt so clear. HER WORDS No nigger faggot is going to come stay in my house. pretty much sealed it for me.

***EDIT THANKS FOR ALL YOU SUPPORT. Kind of what I needed right now. I dont really get the nigger faggot joke. I live in a pretty small town. Ive only seen one black person and have yet to meet someone opennly gay. As much as Im into gay rights and equality, there have been many occasions where Ive called something GAY. I guess she just never had the occasion but Ive made my choice and Im both proud and happy with it. I can always masturbate. When they get in maybe we can post a pic or two for you guys. 

and this for EURISKO

AND YOU ... FUCK YOU. I wasnt even going to respond to you but fuck you.

Your going to bag on my relationship with my son. No we have never lived together. THATS HIS MOMS CHOICE. His mom and her family can provide far better than me and mine. Ive worked 1 full time and 1 part time since she left to give him what he needs. Not what he wants, but what he needs.

Once every 3 months I can save up enough to take the day off work and make the 15 hour round trip to his town so I can sit in the coffee shop he works and watch him while I pretend to read the paper. Dont you dare fucking call me a negligent father.

His partner apperantly has his own place but his dad got drunk, kicked in his door and beat the shit of him. They are kids. They do not feel safe and have asked for my help. Like I have always told my son I will be there fo him when he wants me and nothing will stand in my way.

I only get contacted by one person on craigslist and he describes the wallet and contents perfectly.

She tried to pay with a gift card that did not have enough money, then she pulled out all the cash she had, a wad on $1s, and change still not enough. She then begin to take items out of her basket, first was the essentials, toothpaste, toothbrush, some flu medicine. Then went the wrapping paper and fish food. I can see her struggle as she had to remove toys from her basket. I don't know what came over me but i leaned to the cashier and told her to ring everything up and that i'll pay for it. The mother looked at me and begin to cry, to which i responded I am forgetful just like you, I always leave my wallet at home. I then reassured her that it was no bother at all and please don't spread rumors such as that i am a nice person or anything.

The point is that they specifically brought up the baby wipe thing in the list of general questions and asked if I did this. I said yes, and they said stop it. 

Apparently more and more people are using baby wipes after the pewps, but it's a bad trend because the [soap*](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/jy3gx/reddit_can_i_convince_you_to_stop_using_baby/c2g4syb) can dry out this most delicate region.

It's especially bad if you already have some unfortunate jazz going on down there such as swollen hemorrhoids or diarrhea (counterintuitive, I know).

Reddit, do as you will. But I recall a big wave of ""baby wipes'll change yer life"" comments awhile back, and I thought you should all be informed.

Cakeday for me. lol 

I woke up today thinking about where I was in 2007. Happy, good job, recently moved to California, finally feeling like my life was going somewhere from a difficult childhood/early adulthood. 

Barely a year later as the economy was crashing, my mother got very sick with cancer. I quit my job and traveled 500 miles away to care for her 24/7. It was the most rewarding and devastating thing that's ever happened to me. When she died in 2009 - and I know it sounds cliche - part of me died with her. I was emotionally wrecked and financially devastated; she had no insurance, so you know (or can imagine) how that goes.

But, you know what? I'm getting past it. That's what the last 3 years have been about. Really, I'm no worse off than many people in the US, much less the world. Do I have the career and the life I thought I'd have? Nah. But I'm finding my way, got married, am following a silly dream, and I'm putting one foot in front of the other as best I can.  

You can see from my history that I haven't been the best contributor, and yet reddit has given me something amazing anyhow: perspective during many difficult times. From the big popular posts to the awesome subreddits I subscribe to, I've been getting to see people *who don't even know each other in real life* do amazing things for one another, even if it's as simple as telling a hilarious story (or painting a shitty watercolor). This has made all the difference for me as I've gone through various stages of wanting to give up.

Forget the bullshit: I woke up this morning and also realized that I've checked reddit every single day (when it was physically possible) since 2007, and it blew my mind a little bit. So thank you, to no one and to everyone in particular.

Our party consisted of myself, my girlfriend Shanna and our friend Brandon, who was to be accompanied by our friend Joe, who was himself running late. As a coterie of security guards checked the three of us in, they wanted to know where was Brandon's date what kind of car *she* would be driving so they could keep a look out for *her*. 

""Uh,"" I said, ""his partner's name is Joe."" (I don't know why I said it that way, it just came out. Joe and Brandon are heterosexual)

Needless to say, the security guard reacted with shock.

""Joe?"" he said. ""This is a Christian environment, and we can't allow them to attend. It will disrupt the evening for everyone.""

When pressed, the guard reiterated that you can't be a Christian if you're gay.

""Can you tell me what exactly is Christian about being gay?"" the officer rhetorically asked. Nothing, obviously.

The worst part? Ham is getting tax breaks from the state for a full-size replica of [Noah's Ark](http://http://arkencounter.com) and claims that the jobs it will create will be open to all people (gays included) despite the kind of treatment they receive at his museum.

So, I've been going to school at SUNY Purchase in New York for a couple of months - freshman year. I'm 23, so I haven't interacted with a throng of 17-18 yr olds in quite a while. It's weird. I'm also a commuter.

Anyway, I'm on the student bus this morning, typing on my laptop, putting some finishing touches on an essay. A few rows behind me is an older man who looks like he's seen better days. Actually, he looks plain fucking terrible. Late 50s, I'm guessing. 

The bus makes a stop and a young girl gets on the bus. The old man and her look at each other in recognition, and she sits next to him - I'm able to catch that they're in class together. I was a little surprised to hear that this old man is going to college, but that turned into respect fairly quickly. A lot of people his age would be too proud or too tired to go back to school, but was tackling it with verve. 

So, the two of them are talking, and there are these two girls nearby. They're laughing to each other obnoxiously about some dumb shit. The old man diverts the conversation with his young classmate from their schoolwork into a bit of his personal life. She's listening politely. He seems to be relishing the opportunity to talk to someone, anyone, about *anything*. The stuff he's saying is really fucking sad like, too - mother sold the house, he's lived on his own for years, lost everything, got dumped in a home by his family, worked odd jobs, got fired, got fired again, and now he's trying to reclaim his shit by going to school.

And these two fucking girls start motherfucking *laughing* at this man. Laughing. They're fucking laughing. My mouth just opens in shock. 

See, at first he doesn't hear them. His classmate did, though - she turns beet red. These two girls aren't pointing at him or anything like that; they're still facing the same way but they wait to laugh until he finishes a sentence that they find to be particularly pathetic.

He catches on pretty fast, and starts stammering and fidgeting, completely embarrassed and out of place. He starts asking his classmate questions about their assignment but he says some terms incorrectly, which make the girls laugh again. 

One of them catches eyes with me and shrugs with a grin on her face - the whole ""Can you believe this fucking old man?"" look. She's expecting me to be in on the joke. Instead of giving this fucking valkyrie bitch what she wants, I set my jaw, give her the ugliest look of derision I can and shake my head, saying ""No."" She looks surprised and turns away. 

I wish I had the fucking balls to say something at the time. I also wish it was socially acceptable to draw and quarter idiots. 

Anyway, that whole shitty scene just really sucked the life out of me. Extremely depressed and angry about it, but there's not much I can do unless I see that guy again and buy him a drink. Which I will, if I see him again.

Clean cut

&gt;&gt;EDIT&lt;&lt; what we know:
Cellphone records checked, nothing beyond the time he went missing. GPS tracking does not work because his phone is out of battery. No bank or credit card activity. All the people he was with were questioned. The bar was investigated as well. Apparently he left the bar alone around the mentioned time. He did not make it home. No friends or family have heard from him since the mentioned time. No issues with friends, strangers, or family are known. He's a very happy go-lucky guy who's extremely open-minded and social. If there were any problems on his mind he would have talked to someone, or at least there would be signs.

The goal of this post was to get the word out, and try to have people know who he is and recognize his face. I'm aware of the possibilities of how we'll find him, but let's not dwell on that for now. I'll keep this updated if we get anything big.

It's like he walked away from the bar and vanished into thin air. I have no idea what to think.

If people can keep an eye open for him if you're in the area or pass the news around I would really appreciate it. I'm just trying to get the word out to anyone I can. It's almost been a week and we're desperate. Thank you for reading this, at the very least.

1326132524.0,699,self.self,o9jof,It has now been 10 days since my little brother disappeared in New York City.,antiqueChairman,1065,366,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/o9jof/it_has_now_been_10_days_since_my_little_brother/,"[It has now been 10 days since my little brother disappeared in New York City.](http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Missing-Boy-Student-22-Parents-Virginia-New-York-City-136950343.html)

For the first four days or so we didn't even know he was gone.  Once we realized what had happened, my father and I traveled to New York and spent two days crawling around the city, getting the police investigation started and putting up fliers.

It was cold as balls and we both cried a lot.

After those two days it became apparent that we'd be a lot more help back in Virginia, and that a lot of wonderful people in NYC had things under control.  We drove home.  We drove all night.

My house has people in it, friends of my parents.  They're our support group.  They've brought over food, and man the computers, approving join requests for the facebook group and answering phones and stuff.  They've been really helpful and we appreciate that they've taken their personal time to help look for my brother.

I have a pretty small circle of friends, and I usually dont see them much.  I've been spending a lot of time with them since this crisis began, though.  My brother's roommate and her boyfriend, and my two Main Bros.  It's helped a lot to have them around.  I've been filling up my time to distract myself, mostly with [trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/) 
and [ponies](http://www.reddit.com/r/Idliketobeatree/).

I dont know if it's okay for me to post about myself.  I was a new redditor before all this happened, and now I dont really have anonymity, at least not for anyone who really looks.  My dad tells me to be careful about what I post.  He tells me that [my previous reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/o3wnd/my_little_brother_has_been_lost_in_new_york_city/) on the subject is being used as a source by media sources in a lot of the cities carrying the story.  When a few people read online about Ian's interest in trees, they reported it and some people took that as a prompt to stop searching.  They'd already judged my brother and didn't want to help someone like that.  I worried that maybe I'd hurt things more than I'd helped.

People keep telling me they cant imagine what it must be like to deal with something like this.  I want to tell them that they've got it all wrong.  You DONT deal with something like this.  I cant talk about it to my friends, or parents... half the sentences end with me just trailing off, pleading with them to fill in the rest.  I don't know how to tell them that none of the evidence matters, that none of what actually HAPPENED matters, because the obvious truth is that nothing could have happened to him.  He's my brother, dont you people understand that?  He CANT be hurt.  He cant be gone.  I can still hear him.

A woman told me last night that she believed in angels.  We had a Direct TV guy come by to install a satellite, so we could watch CNN for updates.  The Direct TV dude had an inspirational story to share about having gone into a coma or something and was brought back to consciousness by a nurse who turned out not to work at that hospital.  The man believed that nurse was an angel.  The woman I talked to believed that that man had been meant to bring us that story.  She said it was a sign.

I dont believe in signs.  I don't believe in angels.  I believe in things that dont make sense, though.  I believe in things that I cant prove.  I believe in my little brother.  No matter what they find, no matter what happens.  I will believe what I need to believe to live in a world that has him in it.

It's obvious if you read the two accounts (@AmandaBynes, @persiannyc27) that the tweets are being written by the same person. My reasoning is as follows:

1. Take a look at the username NYC is where Amanda lives and she is 27 years old.

2. The account was created early May but recently has become more active. It went a while without tweeting anything then suddenly resumed and was retweeted by Amanda on more than one occasion.

3. It was RT'd by Amanda seconds after posting.

4. The ""name"" under the account is MalibuBarbie...this is a name certain media outlets have taken to calling her.

5. The two accounts use the same insult and one of them insults @Drake, which if you've followed any of her antics makes a lot of sense.

6. For an account Amanda retweets alot they never actually talk to each other.

So, why should media care? Because she is saying she wants to stab people in the face, carve out eyeballs, and stab people in the throat.

It's just rough to watch. I worked with her years ago on The Amanda Show. She was an incredibly nice girl back then, as were her parents, and it's just hard to watch her slip like this and not get help.

I'm a stutterer, I have been ever since I was born, I became self-conscious about it when I was 8 probably, and my siblings would sometimes mock me for it, but I have had my periods of fluency and others of not being able to utter a single word.

But the one thing that has been making me feel depressed and utterly useless is that one time I thought ""what if I can't say my name?"" and from that point forward, I gave myself the fear of saying my name, and at first I would stutter through it, but then more recently I couldn't start the sound no matter what, I would swear, tense up, and no matter what I did nothing would come out. The one time I managed to say it with ease was when I had some speech therapy, but that didn't last long and I was back to square zero shortly after. It causes me a lot of moments of ridicule from my classmates and doctors sometimes.

I think the worst time, the time that made me feel I had hit rock bottom, was once during a drive to an appointment, and they took my ID card, and when I finished and came to get it and was asked my name, I pretended to be deaf and handed my driver's license to give the security guy my name, I felt truly powerless and like a piece of shit.

I'm 22 currently and will become an uncle in a few months, I'm also graduating from university and will have to give a presentation about my senior project in about a month, and I feel like I need to get this off my chest.

It's not my fault the computer only offers the option to use EBT Foodstamps, not EBT Cash, and your cigarettes are therefore ineligible for compensation. You have the audacity to call me a worthless idiot because I'm ""just a stupid cashier girl""? Fuck you. I work 40+ hours a week to pay my bills, while still putting aside money so I can eventually finish my bachelors degree. Meanwhile you're sitting around on your lazy ass all day, getting federal aid to cover your expenses. 

Guess fucking what? Your cigarettes are **not** vital to your life. If you're poor enough to qualify for EBT, you should probably focus on buying fucking food to prevent you from starving, and not cigs. You were rude and crass, and you epitomized the stereotypical Philly trash that gives our city a bad name. 

You had no courtesy for the line of 20+ people that ended up forming behind you as you spent ten minutes yelling at me for something *I couldn't control*. You're lucky I wasn't a customer in that line, because I would've given you a fierce talking to for harassing an employee over something so stupid. Unfortunately I was the worker, so I had to stand there and smile and apologize over and over, even though I really just wanted to punch you in the fucking face.

I love my job 99% of the time. Truly and honestly. So congratulations on making it into the 1% of the time that I really fucking hate it. Cherish this moment, because it will probably be the only time in your life you will be the one percent. Dumb skank bitch.

Additionally, in the past couple hours, I've taken the time to respond to a couple different posts that had a similar response, so I think I'll just add a slight amendment up here. I am very, truly sorry if I caused anyone grief by accidentally perpetuating the myth that everyone on welfare/EBT is lazy. It wasn't the fact that this woman was on it that made me judge her, but rather her irrational and entitled behavior. I've met amazing people, who have simply fallen on bad times and need the support to afford basic food staples for themselves and their families. Conversely, I've met terrible and lazy people who have abused the system, and twisted it to their own advantage. The woman's attitude greatly mirrored the latter group of people, and I cannot in all honesty bring myself to feel proper empathy for her, but that was still no reason for snap judgements on my part.

""We just want your cash!"" they say, pointedly. Such terrible profiling. I'm hardly the go-to guy when it comes to cash. I hand over my wallet and mention with sympathetic dismay: ""I think there's only 10 bucks in there..."" He takes out the cash and hands back the wallet. A simple public transaction, you might say. He counts the bills: there's $6. He blinks. I shrug. Plan B mode: ""Give me your cellphone!!!!"" Humor, you toy with us! This adolescent delinquent joins the sorry few who realize just how rinky-dinky my cellphone is. In another life, it was a hammer. Imagine a phone that feels sorry for itself, daily apologizing for existing. That's my phone. Handing it to him was like passing a broken, quenched torch. He looks at it and is overcome with discouragement. The same way I felt when I bought it. We all give a sad sigh. It wasn't being a good night for any of us.

Reluctantly, they run across the street, past the shopping mall and disappear into the night. The two ladies at the bus stop sit in silence, frozen, staring at me, wondering what I'll do next. Indeed, what I do next wasn't easy. But I push myself to do it. I muster all the goodness within me and in my mind call out: ""I FORGIVE YOU CELLPHONE, you dastardly excuse of a communication apparatus. Take my forgiveness with you and be whole!""

And just like that: all the bitterness I had been harboring for the past four months simply melts away. T'was a night of reconciliation, of forgiveness, of a poor boy being robbed at knife-point and somehow coming away richer.

Nothing else happened that night except everything else that happened.

I'm still shaking.,ImTheManOkay,1074,391,164,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ohzfx/this_is_my_real_cake_day_story_im_still_shaking/,"This is by far one of the more bizarre experiences I've ever had. On this, the first day of my 22nd year of living I talked a man out of killing himself.

I was on my merry way home from work. I work the night shift at a hotel (which sucks ass) and I had just gotten off around 6 AM. I was cruising to McDonalds for a delicious Sausage and Egg McMuffin when I noticed somebody walking in the middle of the road. Being the idiot that I am, I kept driving when I noticed that this mother fucker was SPRINTING into oncoming traffic. The car in front of me had to swerve to avoid this guy. Now it was my turn.

This guy is sprinting at my truck and keeps aligning himself with me as I swerve through the road. I make a last second correction and miss him by inches. I wasn't going that fast, but it's a two-ton vehicle... At this point, I call the cops because this guy is going to hurt himself or somebody else - or both. I continue following him because honestly, I thought the guy was on PCP or something and I was going to have to pull my knife out and go Rambo on his ass. 

I follow him through a gas station then across the street as he tries to get hit by another car. He ends up in front of a grocery store where he collapses in tears. I roll down my window and can hear the guy sobbing. I mean absolutely the most gut wrenching sobs you can imagine coming from a fully grown man. He looked to be about my age. Pretty clean cut, clean clothes, nice jeans and shoes, hair cut. I yell out to him and ask if he's okay. He doesn't respond. 

I keep yelling out to him and finally he responds that he's okay. This guy was just trying to lose a real life game of Frogger, so he's not okay. I ask him if he wants a bottle of water and he says yes. Walks up to the truck, tears pouring from his face and takes the bottle of water. I start trying to get him to talk and he barely can. Not because he's drunk or under the influence, but because he was crying so hard. I present to him my concerns about him running out into traffic and he agrees with me which sets him off into tears again. So at this point I know what he just did was totally fucked. 

What I do next is absolutely stupid in every way I can think, but I ask him if I can get out of the car. He says yes. I tell him I'm armed and will defend myself if necessary, to which he responds with more sobs. I give him some napkins and tell him to take a drink, breathe and sit down. He does. We share a cigarette while he tells me about losing his job... Getting kicked out of school... His alcoholic father kicking him out when he got his girlfriend pregnant. Then he goes on to tell me about his girlfriend who went into labor early and then died giving birth... To a baby that did not live.

We talked for about 30 minutes. I eventually ended up talking him out of pulling some shit like this again (for the time being), giving him my number and the suicide hotline number. Gave him $100 of my birthday money and asked him if he could picture a world in which he wanted to live in. He said yes, and I then told him that the rest of his life should be dedicated to creating that world, and to pursue it with the same fury that compelled him to run into traffic and to honor his girlfriend and baby in that way. Fucking cheesy, but I already gave the guy water and $100. Didn't have much more for him... Gave him a ride to a nearby bus stop so the cops (that I called...) wouldn't pick him up. 

Maybe this guy was full of shit, really was high on PCP and was 30 seconds from stabbing me in the throat with a coat hanger, but I don't think so. I thought that MY 2012 started off like shit, but after an amazing birthday and dealing with this guy, I realize I'm fucking blessed (in the most non-religious way possible). I can only hope that I had the tiniest effect on this guy's life. Because I know that he did, if only for one day. Because goddammit, this will be the best Sunday of my short life.

Peace, love and crabs, Reddit.

**EDIT:** Everyone's kind words are unbelievably appreciated. Times have been tough for this guy as well, so this certainly put things in perspective. Slept for a couple hours and woke up still shaking. This bloody mary is definitely taking the edge off, though.

**EDIT 2:** Front page? Damn. I'll tell you what... After a couple drinks and throwing down some food, I'm not sure I've enjoyed a day this much in a LONG time. I got to work an hour or so ago, and was notified a guest had a stroke and passed away. All of this on the birthday of one of my best friends who passed away almost 2 years ago, the day after my birthday. I don't really believe in ""signs"", but I'm going to go ahead and pretend that something is telling me my life is fucking great and I need to put my bitch-ass into motion and take every advantage of what I have. *Insert other cliched statements here* It shouldn't take a day like this to remember how lucky most of us are.

1288203793.0,680,self.self,dxaox,This Does Not Belong at the Rally to Restore Sanity. ,aliveshecried,1318,638,615,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dxaox/this_does_not_belong_at_the_rally_to_restore/,"http://blog.norml.org/2010/10/26/join-norml-at-the-rally-to-restore-pot-sanity/

Stewart specifically said NOT to make the rally about pot.  This is perfect ammunition for the right to trivialize the rally.  Can we prevent NORML and similar organizations from hijacking the rally?  Or, at the very least, tone down their posters?  This is sending the wrong message.

Edit:  Thank you YouthInRevolt

If you agree, please contact NORML:

Call Norml: (202) 483-5500 Email Norml: norml@norml.org

Edit 2:  Chadius333 summed up some of my sentiments quite nicely, in case I did not do a good enough job:

I really don't know how it could be any more obvious that NORML's presence is not a good thing. This rally, at least in my opinion, is to show that there are a lot of people in the U.S. who are tired of the way things are going and have decided to stand up and call bullshit. The rally's impact needs to expand beyond those who already support it. The people who watch Fox News, support the tea party, etc, etc, need to see that there is a very large group of people who feel quite differently and are willing to unite, stand up and say something.
Now, having said that, if NORML has a strong presence at the rally, the entire conservative side is going to write the rally and all of our efforts off as liberal, hippie bullshit. You will see pot leaf picket signs in every single shot on Fox News... I guarantee it.
I realize a lot of you are strong supporters of the legalization of marijuana (I am one of those people too) but this just isn't the right time or place. This isn't a platform for legalization of marijuana, it extends far beyond that.
Anyway, I hate pandering as much as the next person but I think it's honestly a small sacrifice that could help yield some pretty incredible results.

Edit 3:  Even if you are for NORML's strong presence at the rally, have you taken a look at the poster?  It's juvenile *at best*.  A 12 yr old could make a more professional poster.  Do you really think it is going to help promote a pro-legalization message to anyone who isn't already pro-legalization? 

Final edit and attempt at clarification:  This is less about the sanity of legalization or whether or not it should be discussed in a rational manner like the other issues. Rather, it is more about the proper way for NORML to promote their message. I am for legalization but I absolutely hate that poster. It brings absolutely nothing to the table. ""Legalize Pot"" above a banner of pot leaves? What does that do for the movement, honestly? How does that start a rational conversation about legalization?

Coming home from work, opening the door… and getting hit with a musty, damp odor. My mind started reviewing a mental checklist of things it could be… the garbage disposal, the trash, the plumbing, the plants… a lot of possibilities.  


I took out the trash, dumped some ice cubes down the disposal and ran the hot water into it for a minute. Did a light wipe down of the counters. Then continued to my normal nightly routine.

Next day, come home from work, open the door… and there it is again… the odor.

It doesn’t appear to be originating from the kitchen. It must be the plants… let me get on google and see about those plants. Oh? Indoor plants need to be potted in a special soil or they cause odors… rah rah… ok so check the plants. Looks like regular soil. Must be the plants.

I segregate all the plants into the guest bedroom. Vacuum and deodorize all the areas that held plants. All set. On to my nightly routine.

Groundhog Day syndrome. Next day, come home from work, open the door… and there it is… the odor again.

This goes on for about a week or so. None of my normal half-assed attempts seem to be having any effect.

That weekend I pulled out the big guns. Friday after work I stopped at Walmart on the way home and stocked up on cleaning supplies. Lots of cleaning supplies. Baking soda, vinegar, mops, carpet deodorizers, air fresheners, drain cleaners… everything. A couple odd looks and a comment from the checkout girl about it being a little late for spring cleaning, and I am on my way home. Ready for war.

A day and a half later, moved furniture, and a fresh smelling house… I felt pretty proud of myself. I won the battle. The odor was no more. Or so I thought.

Monday rolls around. Déjà vu. Come home from work, open the door… and there it is… the odor. Again.

Not sure what to do next, I hit the internet, start researching. Contact the landlord, ask about the sewage, ask about mold, mildew. He suggests to clean the drains again and if it doesn’t go away after that, he would come out to investigate.

About mid-week as I’m coming home from work I pass by (HoAGuy), who runs the HoA for my subdivision. I ask him to step inside for a moment to see if he can identify it, thinking maybe he has had experience with odors. He had a lady with him who was holding a clipboard, I believe he said her name was (HoALady). He mentioned she would be better at identifying odors than he was, and we all walked up to my front door. As soon as I opened the door, she immediately commented “That’s a dead animal.”

“It smells like it’s probably something bigger than a mouse, maybe a squirrel.” They suggest I get animal control out to track down the source.

HoAGuy mentioned that if it’s a mouse or a rat or something inside, it’s my responsibility, but if it’s a squirrel or other animal that got in via something out of my control, the HoA would reimburse me for any cost accrued for the removal.

So I contact landlord again, he says I should take their advice and contact animal control. So we did.

Saturday rolls around, animal control guy comes out. We start searching. He confirms it’s definitely the smell of decomp. We trek through the house, and eventually he settles on the front corner of the house, next to the front door. He says it must be something in the wall, quotes me $600 and up to punch holes in the walls and floor looking for it, with no guarantee that it would find it, and it would be our responsibility to fix everything after it’s done. Great. Not looking good.

We step outside and we are chatting about maggots and other delicious topics, and my eyes drift over to the vacant unit next to ours.

We’ve lived here about a year and a half and have never seen a soul in or out of the unit next to us. I’ve always assumed someone bought it to flip it and never got around to it. I mentioned to the animal control guy “Hmm… I wonder if it’s maybe in that vacant unit…” he says it’s worth looking into before we tear up my walls. So he gives me his estimate, and starts heading back to his car. Out of curiosity, I wander over to start sniffing around the sliding glass door of the vacant unit. That’s when I see them. Flies. Big, plump nasty flies… all over the inside of the glass.

“Whoa hold up a sec, man… come here real quick”…. I called him back. “This place has been vacant as long as we’ve lived here, how could all those flies get in there”. “Oh yeah, something’s dead in there…” he replied.

Of course, being the weekend, HoAGuy was in the mountains. So I called the landlord, explained the situation and he said he would start making calls to try to find out who owns the unit so we can get someone in there to check for the dead animal.

Monday rolls around again. I get home, open the door… you know the rest. I walk back outside for some air. I see the lights on at HoAGuy's place so I go knock on his door. He’s home and answers the door. “Has landlord or the management company contacted you?” “About what?” he asks. I point at the vacant unit and reply ”About the vacant unit, animal control thinks the smell is coming from in there…”. “That’s not vacant, (ElderlyLady) lives there, she’s a recluse.” Uh oh.

I explain the situation, and the flies, and he comes out and investigates with me. The neighbor who lives on the opposite side of the lady’s unit comes out and joins us on the lawn, and starts describing that he has also been fighting the same odor problems. HoAGuy starts banging on the door… no answer. Other neighbors start coming out. Several people chime in that they haven’t seen ElderlyLady in at least a month. I’m thinking about how I haven’t seen anyone in there since we moved in. Apparently, an elderly lady lived there, who was very reclusive. Described as mid seventies, doesn’t leave the house often, and doesn’t answer the door. Very private. We never heard her through the wall, never seen her. All the windows had been covered up with white blankets or sheets for as long as I remember. The sheets were all tattered and ripped. Thick cobwebs between them and the glass. No signs that anyone lived there.

As we are banging on doors and windows, HoAGuy is noticing more and more flies and starts to get visibly concerned.

So finally we call the police, explain the situation and they say they will send a unit out. They arrive about 20 minutes later. The female officer takes statements, tries banging on the door, and nothing. She lets us know that the fire dept. is on the way to open the door. About 15 minutes later the firemen arrive and pry open the door. As soon as the door was opened, the odor came out swinging…and boy was it a brawler.

The 2 officers stepped inside the doorway and after about 10 seconds came out looking green and gagging.

HoAGuy walked over to them, and after a brief discussion came back to us nodding his head. She was in there. She was deceased.

Fast forward about 2 hours, a lot of tears from the neighbors and some weak stomached paramedics. The coroner finally arrives with his team, and they remove the body. As they were moving across the lawn, the odor almost knocked people over.

HoAGuy started asking the officer some questions, and while they wouldn’t answer much, they did say that she was found there in the living room. There… less than 3 feet from where I sit every night eating dinner and watching TV. 2 thin layers of drywall and some insulation was all that separated me from a human body decomposing for a month.

So I did what any normal person would do in that situation… I ordered some wings, sat on that same couch, watched some TV and went to bed.

Well… maybe normal isn’t the right word…

TLDR: Foul smell in house for past month, was deceased elderly neighbor decomposing on the other side of the wall

1296066952.0,673,self.self,f9i1u,Advice for all who dissent on the streets and face Riot Police,SolidSolidarity,1213,540,625,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/f9i1u/advice_for_all_who_dissent_on_the_streets_and/,"I've been an active participant in many demonstrations that have faced riot police in Greece and other parts of Europe and I would like to share what I've learned with those who are struggling against their government. 

I've noticed a striking lack of equipment on the part of the protesters in Tunisia and Egypt that should be easy to obtain and will greatly help them continue to their struggle against the government. 

Here's my best advice.

* Goggles, but not all kinds

Goggles will protect your eyes against tear gas (CS gas) and pepper spray, but make sure to wear a kind that will not fog up and blind you. Ski goggles with the vents taped up work excellently for this. Swim goggles that fog and are not recommended. I imagine ski goggles in the Magrheb are not so common, but try safety goggles instead. Again with the vents taped. Pepper spray can viciously temporarily blind you: goggles work amazingly well against it!

* Masks

While masks may create an anti-social environment, they are essential for protecting your identity from the police. Eyes are also incredibly expressive and can quickly be used to identify your friends and allies on the street. The easiest mask to make is from t-shirt. Place the hole of the head around the face and tie the arms of the shirt tightly behind the head. A mask like this is easy to take on and off when the situation changes and allows credible doubt.

* Gas Mask

Dust masks hardly work against pepper spray or CS gas. Use a gas mask that has a filter, or two, which is preferable. They are surprisingly cheap and can usually be picked up hardware stores. They work very well against both kinds of gas, but are especially useful against CS gas which will incapacitate you after inhaling. They fit well under a t-shirt too.  Remember!  after each major gas attack on a manifestation, the filter of an inexpensive gas mask will have to be replaced.  

* Body Sweat

Gas often sticks to body sweat. Freshly showered bodies attract less painful gas, especially tear gas. The situation in the Maghreb may not be so conducive to being sweat-free, but if possible stay as sweat free as you can.

* Hammers

Without an abundance of rocks on the streets, the next best alternative is to make them, and nothing people for making rocks like hammers. Getting caught without any rocks can create defenseless situation.

* Bats

(Sticks, Staffs)

Can be used in a place of hammer in some situations for making rocks. They're also crucial for defense. Don't let yourself be empty-handed against oppressors.

* Fire extinguishers

Though they're heavy, they can be used with great efficacy to blind riot police and incapacitate them with the fumes. 

* Maalox

Maalox works well against pepper spray. Mix it with water and then douse your face with the mix. Some people swear by it. You can experiment with other antacids as well.  

* Which gas is in the air?

(From a distance) Tear gas will make you cough, Pepper spray will make you sneeze. 

* Water

Carry as much water with you as you can to fight dehydration. Stay in the fight!

. . . 

Additions: (How could I have forgotten?)

* Gloves

Leather gloves will protect your hands while making rocks, lifting heavy objects, or if you trip when running. They are also *crucial* for throwing cannisters as they may be searing hot, but this can't be recommended unless you're wearing a high grade mask.

* Shinguards

Shinguards will save your ankles if you kick back a gas cannister and it happens to go off. This may be especially easy in Egypt as I think they play lots of soccer there. I have not worn shinguards, but I would like to.

* Helmets

Police often go right for the head with their bludgeons. In Greece many people wear motorcycle helmets in demonstrations. Another kind of helmet, which I see journalists wearing, is climbing helmets. These helmets are probably very expensive and unavailable in the Maghreb though. Perhaps bicycle helmets? I do not have first hand experience wearing a helmet, but a helmet can make all the difference between permanent damage (or death) and living to fight another day. I will get a helmet soon.

Best of luck Tunisians, Egyptians, and all of the other oppressed of the world. We're standing with you!

He basically left the White House to go lobby for the White House's bill and make the case that this bill will be perfectly fine for registrars and hosting providers. GoDaddy is both. Andrew Kline is their very own 'Trojan horse', giving the Government the backing they need to sell this dreadful piece of legislation with 'buy-in' from the inside.

Why is GoDaddy playing along? This legislation will tear apart registrars and most Internet providers and put them out of business, but the big ones will survive and gain marketshare. If they can grow bigger and make more money in an environment in which your rights are trampled on a daily basis, what do they care?

Do your research, but also ask GoDaddy why they are playing along with the proposed destruction of the open Internet.

It's OK if you don't care about this topic. There are lots of other posts on reddit that you might like better. Posting ""who the fuck cares"" on every post which someone does not care must be very time consuming?
 I did not expect the sheer volume of nasty, hateful messages I've gotten. I'm pretty sure discussion of this topic doesn't directly steal money from cancer research. I'm also pretty sure that my belief that parents should be the ones choosing which candies their children may or may not have doesn't mean that I am stupid, a mongoloid, morally bankrupt, uneducated, unintelligent, completely retarded, or any of the even lovelier gems that people here have messaged me.    
But I am pretty sure that verbal attacks on perfect strangers who have never said a mean thing is not the way most redditors' mothers raised them to behave. Common man, show a little kindness and respect. You're all better than that.  
Many thank you to all the nice, reasonable people who have sent kind messages, even if we disagreed.

Every time I asked her what was bothering her she just cried harder and louder then get pissed at me. She did this until 2 am that night, woke up like nothing happened, went to work, came straight back to my place, and then started bawling as soon as she came through the door. She did this for four days straight, hours of her just crying without saying a word then acting normal when she woke up and when we were around other people. She ignored me every time I asked her for an explanation. I started to get a bit frustrated.

The forth day she walked through my door and started crying I asked her to leave but that only made her cry harder so I grabbed her and shoved her out of my door. She instantly stopped crying and kept saying ""OK I'll stop!!"". I wasn't trying to be mean but this was about to be my fourth sleepless night and she couldn't even explain why she was doing this. I didn't see a single tear on her face the entire time. She did it for hours everyday and I couldn't take it anymore.

She keeps texting me asking to talk but I've been ignoring them. Something about all this just feels wrong. I'm angry at her because she did nothing but cry and act shitty for four days, I'm worried because she cried for that long, and I'm suspicious because she reacted like she was faking it but who the fuck fake cries for four days?

Edit: typo fix and she called me blocked a second ago. She still won't explain why she cried and kept asking if we can meet up at a restaurant. I hung up and she keeps sending text messages now.

Edit 2: I agreed to meet up with her today. She refuses to explain anything over the phone and wants to talk about everything face to face. I will update later today.

I recently found a 4 page document my grandmother typed up in 2001 about what it was like living in Germany as a little girl during WWII. I just finished retyping it back into a word document. Its a very interested read.

For some back ground information. My grandmother was from a small town called Friedrichshafen in south western Germany, which was where the zeppelins were manufactured and stored. Ive visited Friedrichshafen, and to this day they still manufacture and store the zeppelins there. As I understand it, my great grand father was some kind of engineer or factory worker. And the area produced a lot of machinery, probably used in war, which made the area a huge target for bombers. My grandmother moved to America sometime after the war and met my grandfather.

Here is what she had to say about Germany during WWII. Ive preserved it exactly as she wrote it, including the spelling mistakes. Its a little bit hard to read, as it seemed like my grandmother just wrote about anything that came into her mind, and so the organization is a little funny.

May 2001
Historical Childhood Memories of the Second World War and Postwar Years.

I was born in 1938, just one year before the War broke out in 1939. This “War to end all Wars” lasted from 1939 to May of 1945. We lived in Germany, on Lake Constance, right across the lake from Switzerland.

My Earlier Memories are of being carried downstairs to the basement in the middle of the night by my parents. I was a sound sleeper and never heard the night air raids, but woke up as my parents carried us three children to a wooden pallet in the basement. On our beds we had featherbeds, but in the basement we had blankets. The idea being that if a bomb hit, the air pressure of the exploding bombs would break open the featherbeds and the flying down would probably suffocate us. Our parents tried to get us to go back to sleep on the pallets, but that was impossible with all the terrifying war noises all around us.

During each air raid we would be kneeling in a circle in the basement holding hands and praying to be safe as the bombs were falling all around us, the whistling noise the bombs made was getting more and more high pitched as the bombs came closer to the ground. We were like sitting ducks, never knowing when or if we would be killed.

We were also issued gas masks as it was feared that chemical warfare might be involved. They looked horrible to a little child and breathing through it sounded awful. The only other time I heard this sound was when it was made by Darth Vader in the Star Wars movie. It still gave me a creepy feeling.

On cloudy days we would ask our parents to go outside to play because we knew the planes could not come today due to poor target visibility. We played in the rubble of bombed out buildings. The craters made in the ground by the exploded bombs would fill with water and we would catch frogs to eat. In the winter the bomb craters would freeze over and we would slide on the ice or watch tadpoles and bugs move around under the ice.

The was an anti-aircraft flack station near my home in a meadow. A few soldiers were stationed there and if the siren sounded, warning us of an air attack, the solders would be running through the meadow to open barrels of chemicals to artificially fog up the area and make the anti aircraft gun targets invisible. Nearby was also the zeppelin factory. My hometown was always an alternate target also, as we had railroads and shipping lines.

The streets would be all torn up and water mains broken, so we had to fill up the bathtub and any other containers to save water as we never knew how long it would be until we could get running water again.

Sometimes a “Soup Kitchen” would come by to dish out soup for everyone. It was just a big barrel on wheels, pulled by an animal, and was full of watery soup, but we were hungry and glad to get it. The supply lines were all bombed out and there was nothing on the store shelves to be bought, so everyone resorted to a bartering system. But after a while we ran out of things to Barter with.

There were some farms in the area and people would come from far away to try to trade their belongings for some food. One time my parents heard that a farmer had buried a dead born calve. We did not know if it was sick or what it died of, but my dad and my Uncle went in the night to dig it up so we could have some meat for a while. Also pet dogs and cats would be disappearing in the neighborhood. Often my parents would not eat so that we children could have some food. Much later we learned that some of that food was cat or dog meat cooked into a stew. We also kept chickens and rabbits for food. Some of the chickens were stolen one night and to prevent further loss, my Dad rigged up a bucket filled with some foul stuff from the cesspool. He connected it to the chicken coup door with a rope, so that if the thief would come again he would be doused with the contents of the bucket as he tried to open the door. At one time my Dad was lucky enough to get a little pig. This pig was always hungry just like us and so it would squeal a lot and that was a worry to us as we did not want the neighbors to know we had an illegal little piglet. We also raised rabbits, we would pluck grass from the ditches and feed that to the rabbits and my dad would butcher them when they were big enough and that made a tasty meal for all of us.

I remember my mother trying to cook for us and there was never any kind of fat to cook with, so most of the time it was soup or a stew. My mother found a gray matted, dirty mess of something, she didn’t know what it was. So she brought it home and washed it and it turned out to be some wool or yarn, which she knitted into a sweater for us.

When we were in school, the air raid siren would howl and the teachers told us children to run home. We would run as fast as we could and often we would get a stitch or pain in our side from the effort. There was not enough time to get home before the bombs would start falling and we would run into any house and be welcomed to stay in their basement until the raid was over. If we did not make it home during a raid, my worried mother would get on her bicycle and search for us children, she had no idea if we were alive or not. So as soon as the raid was over we would get out of the good people’s shelter and continue to go home, always the same way, so my mother would be able to find us more easily.

We could not get clothes for us growing children so my Mom and her sister cut down their dresses and sewed them into clothes for us children. My Father repaired our shoes as best he could and we had to save them for the coldest part of the winter so we would not wear the shoes out too soon. We would walk barefoot until long after the ground had frost on it. Our feet would actually burn from the cold ground, but when it started to get seriously cold and when it snowed we were allowed to wear the hand-me-down shoes.

My dad was always supplying first aid to the gruesome wounded right after an air raid and saved many lives. He worked in a defense factory and was not on the front, but helping the wounded wherever he could whether it was friend or foe (enemy).

Seven times the roof was off our home, and we had to hurry to find something to cover it as it often rained and would cause more damage. Plaster would come off the walls and cracks in the house from the exploding bombs falling all around us. Often we had a hard time getting out of the basement after an attack due to too much debris piled up on the other side of the door. We would push against it with all our might so that my Dad could get outside with his big first aids kit to assist the wounded. He once saved the life of an enemy pilot who was wounded and crashed near our home by giving him first aid and hiding him from the gestappo. I have seen men throw through the air in a very high arch, from the pressure of the exploding bombs.
Houses were burning all around us many times during a raid. We had basement windows without glass in them to protect us from flying, broken glass. My Dad protected these opening by covering them with big tree trunks and big iron building clamps to hold them together, but they were torn away from the windows repeatedly by the air pressure created from the exploding bombs. Our woodshed started burning from inciniery bombs (stab brand bomben) several times.

My mother was being shot at while riding her bike to do an errand. The bullet whistled right past her ear.

My parent’s friends visited us on a Sunday so they took us children for a walk up a hill with the destination being a World War 1 Memorial Chapel. Soon a low flying airplane came and started shooting at us. We ran under a tree for protection from the bullets, and each time the plane banked to make a turn to come back to shoot at us again, we would run to the next trees trying to get to the chapel for protection. When we would reach the next tree, our parent’s friends would put us on the ground and would shield us from the bullets with their bodies. The bullets came so close to our heads that we felt the vibrations of the ground as the bullets hit and dirt being sprayed all over us. We finally made it to the chapel, all of us unharmed but shaking from the close encounter as we peeked out the door and watched the plane leave.

We lived close to Switzerland and my Dad would listen to a radio station in Bern. This was not allowed as we might hear the truth about how the war was going. He would turn the volume real low, radio at his ear and covered with a blanket so no one could hear what he was listening to. The schools would question children to as to what we being done at home. And there were always people ready to report you to the authorities. Fear was everywhere. One day my Father made a negative comment at work about the Nazis, someone turned him in and he was hauled out of bed in the middle of the night and taken to be interrogated. He was gone 3 days and nights, my mother did not know what happened to him. He was scheduled to work on the rockets being developed in Travermuende, but after that remark and interrogation his work assignment was cancelled, and ruined his career. But at least he was alive and back home with us again. It was also time for my older sister to join the Hitler Youth group. My father did not allow it and guess what, her grades immediately took a nose drive.

Occupation years after the war: We had French occupation – I saw a soldier walking with an orange in his hands, I wanted that orange so much. I had never tasted an orange and recognized it only from pictures. I wanted it so much that I sucked in my skinny cheeks and stomach as I was walking past him, hoping he would see how thin I was and give the orange to me, but he did not. We were all very skinny and always hungry during and after the war. But that was nothing compared to some other things the soldiers did to the older girls.

It was also the first time I saw a black man, he was from Africa with the French Foreign Legion, I think I stared at him for some time, which he very graciously endured. One of these occupational soldiers enjoyed scaring us children as we walked to school. He was a Mess cook and had very long, sharp knifes. Our school was bombed out, so we had to walk to the next village to go to school there and he would always wait for us in different places in the village and scream and run after us swinging his long sharp knives. We would try to avoid him and get to school on different routes, but he would be there too, it was very scary for a little girl.

One of my Uncles was a prisoner of war in Russia, that was the worst possible imprisonment. There was hardly any food for the men and they were starving yet they had to do hard labor. My uncle did not talk much about that time of his life, but one time he let it slip that he had to plow a field with a big nail. He came home sick and emanciated. A German doctor checked these released POW’s over and cautioned all the men that after arriving home they should not celebrate with food as their bodies would not tolerate regular food, that it would kill them. And it was true, those who did not listen to the doctor’s advice died soon after coming home. My uncle survived by eating potato peels and whatever else he could scrounge from our little garbage can. It was a pitiful sight to see, but he survived!

We lived at the dge of town and there was a Prisoner of War camp one block from our house. I belief it was mostly Russians. We would try and put some food and cigarettes stubs through the fence. The Camp had a very fierce dog that scared us many times as we would try to sneak up to the fence and drop something through for the prisoners.

During an air raid the camp gates would be opened and let the captured soldiers out, to avoid mass killings should a bomb drop on the camp. They would all run across a meadow to the forest for the protection of the trees where they could not be seen by the airplanes. All prisoners would come back after each raid, as living in the barracks as a prisoner of war was better than being killed on the Russian front.

I remember seeing the enemy tanks with their big guns coming up over a hill toward us and it was very scary for a little child. It was a Sunday in May and we were on the way to church. The adults told us that this meant that the war was over, thank the Lord, and the occupation began. After the war things slowly got a little better. We received C.A.R.E packages from another uncle who lived in New York. That was always a life saver and a highlight. They were sent at an interval of time to my Grandmother, who would wait till evening when all the relatives were home and then we would gather together to open the package in her home. There was canned meat and food and sugar and coffee. It was fabulous food and all was evenly divided. Everything was in English on the packages and not knowing the language we had no idea what was in it until it was opening. So it was always a surprised. These packages were very important to us.

Also, years later I was in California seeing a great 4th of July fireworks, we were close to where the fireworks were exploding and I could feel the air pressure hit me and suddenly I felt just like a scarred little child again. I was an adult and my heart was pounding and I could hardly breath. I had no idea that after all these years I would have such a terrifying reaction and I had to calm myself down, after all, this was not War, it was a fun 4th of July fireworks and I was safe here in America..

The backstory on why I'm doing this: An incredibly close friend's now 17 year old brother was diagnosed in early summer with metastatic brain cancer after getting severe headaches that most thought, including his soccer coaches, was just heat exhaustion (we live in Las Vegas, NV). His mother, the sole provider of the family has horrible insurance thanks to living in the US, and is only covering a small portion of the chemotherapy required for his treatment.

I'm going to use my talents of drumming during this drum-a-thon fundraiser by accepting donations to play ***any*** song requested, no matter how complex, obscure, simple, annoying, or catchy it may be. I've always had it in me to be able to compose drum parts to anything on the fly, so the last few times I have done this, it has been quite the fun thing to do, on top of having the feeling of knowing something great is coming from this.

As the title states, I will be playing for what I believe to be a potential world record of consecutive drumming being live-streamed at ***TWELVE*** hours, which is a little longer than my last marathon, and is nearly 3x as long as any major band playing multiple sets.

* Chicks dig smart guys, so study hard.

* If you're EVER having trouble with anything GO TO YOUR PROFESSORS OFFICE HOURS AND BUG HIM/HER. They have office hours for a reason and it will only help you if your instructor knows your name. (This could be the difference between your instructor letting you make up that test you missed or not)

* If you don't have any questions to ask your instructor during his office hours, ask him a question you already know the answer to, then demonstrate that you understand it. Most will take pride in the fact that they have taught you something, and they will remember you for it.
* Don't go home or back to your dorm between classes, go to the library or a quiet place and get some homework done instead.
* Don't bring your laptop to class, you WILL NOT be productive.
* If you are a gamer and you have a big test coming up, give your controllers to a friend or have them change your password to whatever online game you play to keep you from wasting time.
* Networking is important. Make sure you meet/know someone in all of your classes. When you go to class tomorrow don't be afraid to introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you. 
* Stay away from the ""learning commons"" or any area with a lot of traffic in your schools library. You're there to study, not to run into old friends. Isolate yourself from possible distractions.
* Pack a lunch to take with you to the library so you aren't tempted to quit early because you *think* you're hungry.
* Don't listen to music while studying, it doesn't help. If you need something to drown out rude assholes, use white noise. http://www.simplynoise.com/ works great for laptops, or if you have a smartphone download whitenoise lite.
* If you're studying for ANYTHING that requires memorization, don't spend hours writing words and definitions on flash cards, make a free account on this website http://www.flashcardmachine.com/ It has a very simple interface that makes memorization easy. Ex. Space = next card, N = repeat card now, L = Repeat Card later. PLUS it saves all of your flashcards so you can access them from any computer or your smartphone/ipod.

**General:**

* Never EVER use any kind of a ""pick up line"" on a girl. They don't work. A girl will be more impressed if you can approach her and carry a solid conversation with her, also, make her laugh.

* Learn how to tie a necktie.
* The only appropriate time to wear a bowtie is with a tuxedo.
* If you go to a house party, be sure to introduce yourself to the host.
* Just because someone is a good friend, does NOT mean they will be a good roommate. Also, living with someone who isn't in college is almost always a bad idea.
* When grocery shopping for the ""cost per ounce/pound/kg/whatever"" on the price tag. It makes choosing what brand to buy much easier and cost efficient.
* Be frugal but don't buy the supersaver cheap-o cheese. It's gross. Spend the extra dollar and get the decent stuff.
* Most universities offer free STD testing. There's nothing to be afraid of or embarrassed about. Get tested.
* If you're getting someone of age to buy you booze, give them a buck or two (or beer) for the trouble. When you turn 21 and all of your underage friends are hitting you up for favors you'll understand.
* Avoid eating at fast food restaurants, BUT IF YOU DO then order UNSALTED fries. Most fast food restaurants salt the fries as soon as they come out of the fryer, so if you ask for unsalted fries they usually have to make them fresh. Then you can salt them yourself. 
* Don't leave your laptop plugged in 24/7. It will murder your battery life. Unplug it when it is fully charged. **EDIT** I have been informed that I am wrong about this. WHOOPS
* Brush your teeth.


That's about all I have right now. I'm gonna work on my electromagnetism homework and maybe check back later.

* Ask me yes/no questions in the comments. They must be answerable by either the word ""yes"" or ""no"". Ambiguous questions will get a yes/no answer based on which of the two I think is ""most"" correct, but that might not be helpful information.
* Upvote questions that you think will be most relevant to determining my real-life identity. Hence, post each question as a separate comment to maximize the chance that the most relevant questions will float to the top.
* Each 15-30 minutes, I will answer the top question and create a new post in /r/guessmyidentity listing the answers to the previous posts.
* **If you correctly guess my identity, proof (anything that could uniquely identify me) must be submitted via private message.** Posting my personal details publicly in the comments will subject you to extreme reddit moderator butt-hurt. Edit: I'll only answer yes/no to one private message per username. That effectively means you get one guess. I will post to the subreddit if a successful guess is made.
* If my identity is guessed in less than 20 questions, I will stop answering questions.
* If a proposed amendment to the above rules receives enough interest, I'll consider it.

If I'm impressed, you might get some Reddit Gold for your efforts.

The firemen were very concerned and obviously wanted to help but couldn't do anything for us. Eventually we had to just leave her with some food and go on our way because it was getting late. For the next couple of days all I could think about was watching her in the car mirror as she walked away into the dark. I walked around the parts of the city near where we found her, called the SPCA and all of the shelters in the area and left my contact information everywhere I went. Miraculously, after about 3 days I got a phone call from the shelter down the street. ""I think we found your dog"". It still makes me tear up thinking about it now. I raced to the shelter and there she was wagging her bandaged tail. I immediately called my mom who had agreed to make the two hour drive to come get her since my apartment didn't allow pets. The vet told us that her skin was raw from sleeping on pavement, she had lost parts of her ears and tail to frostbite and that she was suffering from pneumonia. My mom took care of her and brought her completely back to health, and through connections she had with a ""dog country club"", we were able to find her a loving home with 3 other dogs and plenty of room to run around and play. Without my mom she would not have made it through last winter. I should also mention that the man that adopted her happens to be a fireman himself, and we made sure to tell the original firemen that tried to help us that she ended up safe.

1342967351.0,644,self.self,wytn8,I left my camera with all of our honeymoon pictures on the plane. I've heard of the power of the internet. Please help me...,iliketoquestion,851,207,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/wytn8/i_left_my_camera_with_all_of_our_honeymoon/,"I'll give you some sort of background so you can better understand my desperation at this moment. Please bear with me:

Three weeks ago I married the love of my life, my best friend. We've had a very rough and complicated relationship, starting in high school and lasting for over 10 years before getting married. We've had to endure many things, including 4 years of a long distance relationship when we only saw each other in person 3 or 4 weekends a year. Believe me when I tell you that I could not wait for us to begin our life together as a married couple, and that I was really looking forward to all the memories we would create together, starting with our honeymoon.

The problem, as you may have cleverly deduced from the title, is that I left the camera with all those wedding and honeymoon pictures in the plane. Now I know what you're going to say, reddit: [read in the voice of very old grandma'] ""Pictures are not memories, and the important thing is to value the moments you live together"", or some form of that phrase... Well, Gran Gran Reddit, in the many years of our very long relationship we have learned to value every second we spend together, but you can't deny that pictures sure do help in maintaining those memories. 

We are both severely heartbroken, as those pictures are irreplaceable. We were both looking forward to sharing this trip with our families. I've been calling Delta all week, leaving them messages, filling out their online forms... yesterday I even went back to the airport to speak directly with the lost &amp; found office, and it's always the same answer: ""the item you are looking for has not been found, and has probably been lost for good"" (I'm paraphrasing). I understand that ultimately me losing my camera is my fault, and not theirs, but I can't help but think that I was screwed over. All airlines are required to perform a security sweep of the airplane, which means that either the Delta employee who found my camera on the plane decided to keep it, or that they didn't find it in the first place (thus, constituting a major security breach). Either way, both of these things are very bad press for Delta airlines, and I'm still considering using that as some form of leverage. I'm banking my hopes on someone having found it on the next flight in that plane and keeping it, and having that person read this post. I've seen the internet do greater things with less information, so one can only hope...

The flight we were in was Delta flight 0087 from Venice (VCE) to New York (JFK) on July 16, 2012. My seat number was 41F (I left the camera under the seat in front of me). The camera is a Sony DSC-HX1, and it is in a black bag with a double zipper on top and a white circle with white letters on the front of the bag. I forgot what brand the bag is (the letters inside the circle). Inside the camera and in the small pocket of the bag there are memory cards with all the pictures from our trip. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/IQYTX.jpg?1) (NSFW-ish) is a picture of me with the camera and bag (I'm the one on the left). 

Reddit, if you could help us with this we will name our children after you. I really have faith on the power of this site. We've been through so much, and would love nothing more than to be able to share beautiful memories with our families and friends (not to mention our future kids). I'm just asking for a little real-life karma. Thank you very much for having stuck with me this far.

People tip in different ways for their drinks, sometimes you'll get a buck every drink, or sometimes you get a lump sum at the end of their session, but I never got too worked up about tips.

That all changed when I started waiting tables, for some reason, there is something jarring about opening up that little book and seeing exact change or a big ""X"" through the tip line on the receipt.  Especially when you feel like you really nail a table.  Most times I would try not to let it bother me, but you can't help but wonder if you did something to piss the the person off, or if they were just a cheap ass.

So, one night this guy comes in and says he wants to have a special night for his girlfriend, he gives us flowers to sit at the table, a card, and we were slow, so we even gave them a section by the fireplace all to themselves.  When they arrive I've got their table all set up, they seemed to really enjoy their meal, and I even threw them a complimentary desert because I can, and they seemed cool.

They get up to leave, and I'm telling them to have a good night and I open the little book, and no tip!  Not a penny. I was disgruntled to the max.  So, as they were going to leave I just went up to them and said, ""Was there anything wrong with your service?"" and the lady got a confused look and said it was all perfect, the guy knew why I was asking, but even he said everything had been great. So I say, ""Are you sure about that?"" and kinda let the book flop open to show the lack of any money whatsoever.  ""You didn't leave him a tip?!""  She was obviously mortified and shot him a shitty look.  He mumbles ""I forgot...lemme run to the car..."" He comes back and begrudgingly hands me a greasy, wadded up five. While she sits foot tapping, arms crossed.

TLDR-Don't bother with flowers and fancy dinner reservations if your waiter is an asshole who calls you out for being a cheap ass.

Edit: Whoa, quite a response to my first post.  I just wanted to point out that I've never called anyone else out for a tip, this situation was extreme because of the extra shit.  It isn't the most professional thing to do, and it probably isn't a good career move either.  But, it's a pretty funny story, and at least I have one memory of a customer stiffing me that didn't end in me fake smiling and telling them to have a nice night.  Also, to clarify, this was a previous job and I'm no longer in the service industry, so for the 6 dozen of you who gave the helpful advice to ""Get a real job.""  Thanks. I did.

Also, I particularly enjoyed everyone who thought they could get me fired.  My boss didn't cowtow to trashy, angry, idiots....and that's about 99% of your ""I NEVER TIP"" crowd.  My favorite was the guy who thought he could beat me up AND THEN get me fired.  That would have been a pretty shitty day at the office. 

Lots of good stuff, I had a really good time sifting through all the responses. Kudos to the dude who said he'd hire me.  I love a boss who scoffs at ""The customer is always right.""

Paying for college has been a huge struggle for my mom and me. I've gotten by due to grants and federal loans, and somehow every year my mom has been able to pull together the last bit we were required to pay. But last January my mom had a mental breakdown and was diagnosed as having bipolar disorder. After that she decided she was going to take a break from working so that she could work on herself and get stable. 


This left me indebted to my University for $9000 for the current year I was in. I tried but was unable to get a private student loan. So I finished out my spring semester, worked full time through the summer, and tried to think of anything I could do so that I could pay for my last year. 

Ultimately my only option was to take a year off. Instead of moving back home (3000 miles away) I found a live-in nanny job so that I could save money. In early February I finished paying off the $9000 and reapplied to school. Yesterday I found out I was readmitted and will start school again in the Fall!

I just felt like sharing!

I'm really fucking trying. 

I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying. 

Mostly, I am sorry. 

I'm sorry to my best friend who worried so much after I passed out as we walked to get coffee. 

I'm sorry to my parents who have tried nothing but to get me to eat 

I'm sorry to my sister, who confronted me after seeing me throw away my Christmas chocolate and who cried when I yelled at her 

I tried last month. 

On March 1st, I ate three times. First week, I gained five pounds. Second week I was up fifteen. By my birthday, I was back to 140 for the first time in two years. 

I was also consumed with a deep self-hatred that absolutely consumed me. 

So I stopped trying. 

As of this morning, I am 18 years old, 5'11, and 122 pounds.

In December of 2012 I was 119 pounds. I almost felt happy about myself, despite the constant exhaustion, weakness, and shaking. I starved myself into a muted fuzz that disconnected me from the stress and the depression. At the time, it was an escape. But that is not a solution. 

I tell myself I would like to get help, I would like to get better, but I don't want to gain weight. I want to stay skinny. I don't wan't to admit I have a problem. 

However, I know this can't continue. I don't want to be healthy, I want to be happy with being healthy. 

And the first step towards that is admitting it. 

So here we are, /r/self. 

I am 18 years old, I am male, and I am anorexic. At this very moment, I have my doctor's phone number punched into my phone and am ready to schedule an appointment to talk about my health and my future. 

This is a big step for me. It will be tough but I hope I can bring myself to beat this. I hope I can overcome the shame and the fierce social stigma surrounding male anorexia and the fear and self-doubt that has plagued me my entire life. I at least owe it to my sister. She has too much potential to waste time worrying about me and making sure I eat at least a slice of the bread she baked for me before going out. Ems, this is for you. 

I hope this didn't sound like an egotistical ramble, but this is the first time I've ever actually expressed this. To anyone. 

If you have any advice, any experience, I would love the help. I don't think I can do this on my own. Same goes for questions - feel free to ask me anything. 

Thank you for reading, have a wonderful evening. 


:)

He is a ten year old German Shepherd named Dep.  My family got him as a puppy during Spring Break of 2002.  We inherited the dog when my parents divorced and each moved on.  My sister, a vet student, was supposed to take care of him as soon as she got her own place (she was living with me and my wife at the time).  When she moved in with her boyfriend she claimed she could not take the dog with her.  She then got a Bull Mastiff a few weeks later.  

We kept the dog and he became a part of our life.  I finally got my first piloting job in Oregon last year.  We moved with my wife from Oklahoma and brought Dep with us.  Hardship ensued, my wife was unable to find a job and my starting pay as a pilot does not really cut it.  She has finally found a job, but it is back in Oklahoma.  She leaves in less than a week.  She is moving in with her sister and the apartment complex does not allow pets of any kind.  

As a pilot, I am gone from home on a regular basis.  We cannot afford boarding for Dep on a regular basis.  We tried looking for an adoption service to help us out, most places have turned us down because of his age, the others would just keep him in a cage for the rest of his life if he does not get adopted.  We started considering euthanasia, I don't want to do it, but I think it would be more humane than for him to live the rest of his life in a cage away from his family.

My heart is breaking, I want a good home for him, somewhere he can live out the rest of his days happy.  As a German Shepherd he is a very active, smart, loving, loyal dog.  He is also very protective and does not like other dogs, at all.  He has lived most of his life with cats, so he is capable of getting used to them.  He also does shed, right now he is shedding his winter coat and has chunks of hair falling!

We live in the Portland, OR area and are willing to drive quite a distance to get him to a new home.  Please Reddit, I have seen you guys help so many people, I hope this pulls at your heart strings and help me out.  

TL;DR.  New job means we cannot care for our ten year old German Shepherd and we need to find a home for him so we don't have to put him down.

They also report on every single scientific study relating to something causing cancer, resulting in [this list of things the Daily Mail thinks cause or cure cancer](http://kill-or-cure.heroku.com/), and tend to be biased against climate change. They are often [strongly anti-immigrant](http://www.mailwatch.co.uk/tag/immigration/) to a hysterical degree, and their online version in particular is [incredibly celebrity-obsessed](http://i.imgur.com/DP0V0.png).

[Her obituary.](http://www.webfh.com/fh/obituaries/obituary.cfm?o_id=336123&amp;fh_id=11049)


I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

My brother and sister in law are beyond heartbroken and having a really hard time trying to cope with their daughter taking her own life. My sister in law also just lost a close, young family member of hers a few days ago who was a good friend of theirs. 

On top of their grief, they have just received all the bills for her funeral expenses. Right in time for the holidays. I don't know the extent of them, but they already have had to quit school and are trying to sell their car. They don't make a lot of money and can't afford these bills. I contacted all my siblings to see if we could all pitch in to cover her obituary bill which was $700 alone. There was talk of opening a fund for them, but they had refused until the bills piled up. My sis in law posted to her facebook today that they set up a fund for her funeral expenses through America First Credit Union. It's called Jasmyn Nelson Memorial Fund, account number 9044256.

Reddit, I'm asking if anyone would like to donate to them this holiday season. I feel like a gigantic underserving tool doing this, but I don't have anything to lose. (Karma? fuck it.)

I'm asking for any help I can get them because they can't afford the counseling they need right now or to stay in school. They are too overwhelmed with grief. I love my brother, and it kills me to see his heart shattered into a million pieces. All I want for Christmas is to help make this first one without her a little easier.

If not, whatever, I tried. And I love you regardless, Reddit.

Edit: I guess the only way to donate is by logging into your bank online and doing an electronic funds transfer to America First Credit Union to Jasmyn Nelson memorial fund (routing number is 324377516), or by mail.

Edit: I guess I posted this a little too soon. They just opened the fund today and my brother hasn't had the chance to make a PayPal account for it yet. He probably will have it set up in the next hour or so.

EDIT: Paypal set up. Jasmyn Nelson Memorial Fund. the email is srapnelson@aol.com. I'm not asking for any hefty donations. If five people donate one dollar, I'm thankful. Every little bit helps.

EDIT: I'm going to call and ask my brother if he can add his other email address (the one on the obituary) to the paypal tomorrow for verification purposes. He doesn't know what reddit is, so I have to explain what's going on.  first. I totally understand people being skeptical and I'm not offended. I'll do what I can to make everyone 100% sure I'm not creating some elaborate scheme.

I see a lot of poverty, reminding me of my own childhood and how much my parents struggled to keep us in good schools (much Respek to my parents and ""creative"" district boundaries).  Reminding me of how lucky I am to be able to buy whatever I want, within reason, without much sacrifice.

A brother and sister (ages 9ish and 6ish) were at the register when I arrived so, not really thinking about it, I figured they would be gone by the time I checked out.  They're both wearing pajamas and ratty winter coats, and *alone* in this shithole convenience store on a busy intersection.  Bread, peanut butter, two bags of chips, two bottles sodas on the counter.  The clerk ran their card once.  And twice. And a 3rd time.  It looked like the PIN wasn't working, and the stress/anxiety on the brother's face was obvious with every failed checkout-- something I remember experiencing regularly ~20 years ago.

When the clerk ran their card a 4th time, I noticed him hand the brother an EBT card (food stamps), and my heart sank because I totally know the feeling.  These kiddos were just trying to pick up some snacks for the weekend, and it looked like they were about to go home empty handed.

Before the clerk was able to make a final attempt, I asked the guy to put everything on my card.  The brother didn't seem to understand what I was doing and, honestly, he probably thought I was being a dick by jumping ahead of them. 

I said something retarded like, ""hey buddy, don't worry about it, sometimes my card doesn't work either,"" and exited with my stuff, but the kids were still standing there waiting to pay for their food.  I could see the clerk explain a couple of times that they were good to go and could leave, but they didn't move.  It was only when I was pulling out of the parking lot that I saw them walking out the door, snacks in hand.

If it was a scam? Whatever.  What's $15 to me? Fucking nothing. What's $15 to them?  Probably a whole fucking lot.  Seeing that little dude grab his sister's hand for the walk home brought tears to my eyes because I know that he might be the only stability in her life.  My own older brother and younger sister would have done the exact same thing, and I hope those kids are able to pay it forward from time to time when they're my age.

But as a teacher, let me tell you, I will be afraid every single day if I know that there are guns in my school. Have you ever been walking down the street and seen a random civilian with a gun strapped to his hip? Do you suddenly think to yourself, ""that citizen right there is making me feel very safe at this moment in time""? No, you don't want to go anywhere near that guy.

I hear people say that stricter gun control is just a ""feel good"" measure and that you are the only person responsible for your safety and so you need to protect yourself the best way possible. That if a teacher had a gun at New Haven that somehow they would have become Mr. Eastwood and stopped the whole thing before it got started. But what if the shooter knew he was going into a school where teachers had guns. Well, now he will just bring a bomb to that gun fight. He will walk to the center of the school and just press a button if all he wants to do is kill as many people as possible. Or he will go to a park, or a Starbucks instead.

*Maybe* if a teacher had a gun they could shoot any intruders before they were shot themselves, but I'm guessing when you're bent over little Timmy's desk helping him with long division, if somebody were to bust in your classroom blazing that you would not win that draw.

Are teachers going to keep their gun on their hip? In their desk? In a safe? I don't like having my cell phone visible because of pranksters or teens who want something shiny, am I supposed to walk the aisles between desks with a gun strapped to my hip? 

If a student feels like he has nothing left to live, is he going to try to hold the classroom hostage with my gun? Is he going to pull it from my hip? Am I going to have to shoot a student, or even point a gun? What happens when a fight breaks out (who ever heard of a school fight, right?) and a teacher tries to break up the fight by pointing a gun. Could you imagine the outcry? What happens when a teacher shoots a student or a student finds a way to get the gun. People aren't stupid, if they know a gun will be there they will devise a plan.

So what will having a gun in the classroom do? Will it make anybody safer? Or will it just put guns in every classroom?

I will walk around campus and look everyone I pass in the eye while smiling.

I will then tally the number of people that make eye contact with me, the number of people who make eye contact and smile, and the number of people that completely ignore me.

Then the next day I will make eye contact, but without smiling, and tally the results.

I'll get back to you in a day. 

(PS-This is purely for my entertainment because I am weird)

Edit- Sorry for the late edit.  So, this was a lot more difficult than I expected, I had to narrow down my experiment because it was impossible to look and smile at every single person when they walk by 5 at a time.  So what I did was count out one hundred people that I stared and smiled at so obviously I was certain they were ignoring me.  I tried to make it so there weren't many people around when I singled someone out.
The results:

*52 people looked at me then looked away immediately
    -Some people did the old ""Oh, I'm really looking past you not at you"" thing, but I'll count it

*23 people looked and returned smiles

*35 people ignored me completely

The strange and more important thing is the smiling had more of an effect on me than I thought it would.  After smiling the whole way to a class I would catch myself having a slight grin on my face in that class.  I participated in and enjoyed that class more(least favorite class).  A (cute) girl I've never talked to talked to me and walked with me after class. Another kid I never talked to talked to me too.  So I highly suggest smiling more often.  It made me feel better all day and made me new friends.  We will see how a blank stare does tomorrow.


Edit- Day 2

This is getting to be a long post. I enjoy doing these experiments and seeing the out comes. 

So here are the results for the blank stare.

*39 people looked at me then looked away immediately

*0 people smiled at me

*61 people ignored me completely

I believe more people ignored me because its easier to ignore a stare.  A stare means less than a stare and a smile so more people disregarded it.  At least, that's my opinion.

After performing this experiment I have got the feeling that people want to be noticed and stand out.  I could tell this because of the way they looked at me when I smiled at them.  However, many people were insecure and didn't believe I meant the smile for them.  Well this has been a great experiment. I think we should do these more often.

Please allow me to brag anonymously here.",Daniel_San,1020,410,672,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/c6aim/after_13_years_of_studying_martial_arts_i_finally/,"**(tldr at bottom of post)**

**I'm 23 years old and I've taken various martial arts classes since I was 10 (thanks Mom and Dad!).**  Karate, Taekwondo, Judo, Jiu Jitsu and basic Kung Fu have been my areas of study.  I've also trained in boxing since I was 18.  

I've competed in matches before and done well, but have never been in a real life altercation until this past Monday.  And yes, I'm about to brag, but dammit, I've worked hard to get into this condition and it's not like I'm going to put my real name out there.  I've just gotta tell *somebody* about this, and I know some fellow Redditors will appreciate my story.

So Monday, I was at a bar with my friends. We always meet up at this place to have a few beers and play pool.  It's a college city, but this particular bar is obscure enough to avoid the frat guys and obnoxious bitches, at least until that day.   Five or six douchebags and some blondes were there swilling beer, taking shots, and being loud bastards in general.

**One of them slapped my friend's ass as she was walking by,** and she promptly slapped the creep, whom I will refer to as ""Spike"" because of his frosted hair.   The guy retaliated by yelling, ""you stupid fucking bitch, you're lucky it's my birthday!"".  Whatever the hell that means.

By this time I was already walking up and pissed off, but I've been trained to always control my temper.   I got in his face and told him to take it easy and do his thing while my friends and I did ours.

I'm 5'10"" by the way, and Spike was easily 6'2"". 

**The motherfucker rolled his eyes and SPIT on me.**  A flash of rage came over me, but I still kept it in check.  I was not going to strike the first blow, because of training and obvious legal reasons.

""What the fuck is your problem, man?""  I asked him.  I was about to threaten him when the bartender interrupted and told the guy and his friends to leave.  

I wiped the spit off with a napkin while Spike's buddies paid their tab and convinced him to let it go and leave with them.  As they were leaving, Spike turns and gives everyone in the bar the finger and yells ""Fuck you, motherfuckers"" at the top of his lungs.   A few people yell back to get the fuck out.   Spike and his crew leave.

About a half hour later, the mood hasn't recovered so we all decide to leave.  Lo and behold, Spike and some of his guys are still in the parking lot drinking beers.  He sees me and immediately starts shit up again.  There's some back and forth and I finally tell him to ""stop being a little bitch"".  That's what sets him off, and he stalks towards me in his best Tough Guy walk.

I don't move an inch and wait for him.  It was ON and I knew it.

**His first move is some kind of half-shove &amp; tackle,** but he was way too slow and I stepped out of it, barely needing to shove him to push him on the ground (his momentum took care of that for me).   I could have taken the fight to the ground at this point but his buddies were coming up and I wasn't sure if they were going to try and get involved.

Spike gets back up in a hurry and comes at me again, this time throwing a punch that I easily dodge.  He's got at least 30 lbs on me but is slow as shit. I kick one of his legs out from under him and he hits the ground again.

One of his friends gets too close, and I'm thinking he might just be wanting to hold his friend back and stop the fight.  Instead, he also tries to tackle me and almost gets me off balance, but I also sweep him and direct his face into the pavement.  Somehow, the bastard managed to tear my shirt.

**It's now 2 against 1, so I decide to use harsher tactics.**  Spike is already coming at me, and I back off to give myself some distance.  He's talking shit but I'm not listening to the words.  He comes in close enough and I hit him HARD in the jaw before he has a chance to take his obvious swing.  Spike goes down like a rock.  A fucking one-hit knockout.

One of the dumb blondes is screaming for us to stop, but there's still one guy left and he and I end up on the ground grappling.  He's also bigger than me so it takes awhile, but after a few seconds I get into a good position above him and break his nose by striking with the palm of my hand.  I then press my elbow/forearm into his throat while he's pinned.  

Gurgling, his eyes meet mine and I see the instant change in them when he realizes I could fucking kill him at any second if I wanted to.  He goes limp, giving me the signal to ease up.  I do, slightly.

""Are you done?"" I say a few times.

He consents, and I get up.  There are at least a dozen people watching, my friends and Spike's.   I tell his friends to fuck off and walk off with mine.  I hear tons of ""holy shits"" and ""goddamn that was awesome"" and can't help but feel like some kind of caveman.

When I got home and looked in the mirror, I had a few scratches and later a few bruises on my chest, but I don't remember ever taking one clean hit.  As far as I'm concerned, it was a flawless victory, Mortal Kombat style.  

Except I didn't finish him.  By the time the cops showed up I was gone.  The bartender didn't sell me out, either, since we are regulars.

And that's my story.  Thanks again, Mom and Dad.

We had an 8 a.m. class together, and I had to drive to work after, so I'd pick him up at his place, and groggy, we'd attempt Spanish. 

He lived downtown, across from the jail, and that year, Valentine's Day must have fallen on a Sunday. His yard was littered with oversized construction paper hearts and poster boards with ""I LOVE YOU DADDY!"" scrawled in a child's hand.

""What's with the Valentine's?"" I asked. 

""Must have been visiting day at the jail yesterday,"" he said. ""Afterward, the moms and kids stood in the yard and waved up to the dads. Kids are all dressed up. They hold up the signs, then they left them, so the guys can still see them, I guess.""

""Oh,"" I said, not sure if it was this was the sweetest or most depressing display I'd ever heard of. 

Valentine's Day is one of those crappy holidays that's not a big deal, until it is a big deal.

Back when I was dating my soon-to-be husband, and I worked in an office, he sent flowers on Valentine's Day. These flowers he'd pick were gorgeous, excessive. I'm not really an excessive kind of gal, but dear god there is something lovely about getting the most beautiful bouquet in the office. It vanquishes all the times you never got a lousy carnation in high school when the Student Council delivered flowers to each classroom. It was a Valentine's Day fundraiser, but it should have been called, Today-Is-Popularity-Contest-Day-And-You-Lose.  

Flowers like that make you beam for a week, make the other girls a little green around the gills, make the men look a little sheepish that they didn't think to get a bouquet for their women.

Sometimes, that man of mine would have flowers delivered to me for no reason at all. My coworkers would grin and say, ""Your boyfriend must be in the doghouse. What'd he do wrong?""

And I'd say, ""Nothing. Not one thing.""

The relationship aged, as they do, and when I started working at home, the flowers stopped. No problem. 

A couple of years ago, after I gave him a card and some little knickknack, he realized he'd forgotten it was Valentine's Day. He sprung up from the couch with some awkward excuse about running out. He returned with a Walgreen's bag, trying to hide it from me. 

Inside was a box of stale Fannie May's and an unsigned card. 

For all the nonsense that Valentine's is, it did become the one day of the year when I let myself indulge in the pleasure of picking through a box of chocolates, trying to decide if raspberry-filled are superior to truffles. 

The next couple of years, he didn't forget, though he'd always tease that the chocolates he'd bought were ""hardly stale at all."" He purchased them from the Fannie May store, wonderful, fresh chocolates that satisfied my sweet tooth and subtly said, ""I care about you."" 

So today is Valentine's Day, and my husband is having some kind of an emotional crisis. It's too long and confusing to explain here, but he's working out of town. 

I'm not even sure if he'll call today. I love him so. I'm not sure if he loves me back. I'm not sure if he knows if he loves me. 

And I am sitting here trying to find love in the memory-scent of flowers delivered to my office ages ago, wishing he would walk though the door with a box of stale chocolates.

I know that won't happen. All I can do is stand in this yard, looking up at the emotional jail he is imprisoned in with a giant heart that reads, ""I LOVE YOU SWEETIE.""  

I hope he looks down. I hope he knows I am wishing him a Happy Valentine's Day. 
 
I hope he comes back to me. 

EDIT: Some kind comments, some nice upvotes, and Gold from one of you out there. Thank you for making me smile. Happy Valentine's Day to you.

I used to work in our company's headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland but the department I'm in was moved to Towson. I knew an elderly lady in our Baltimore office named Joyce, who was in charge of maintaining our copy center. Joyce's husband, Don, just passed away.


Apparently Don was in his late seventies and had been suffering a great deal, so its almost a good thing that his struggle is over. I'm not going to go into specifics of his condition except for his dementia. Joyce had to take off a lot of work to be with him because if she wasn't there, he wouldn't be able to convey any information. She had to miss work so much that she ran out of sick days and vacation time.


The office is now collecting money to help in whatever limited way it can. It can't bring him back from the dead. It can't turn back time for Don to when he was healthy and happy. But maybe it will keep Joyce relatively comfortable and able to focus on funeral arrangements and the next phase of her life.

I could editorialize on the system that screws over someone like Joyce, but I don't want to take this post in that direction. I just want to say to everyone the following:

The past month have been many front page posts about many things the government has been doing.  Today there was a story that's literal headline was that Congress almost unanimously passed a bill to revoke the bill of rights from American citizens.  One of the top comments then discredited this accusation, but it was still left on the front page.  Then someone made a front page post about how they feel like the government is preparing to attack the citizens based on all of the stories recently. 

It's fine to get information out but when you filter the news then you discredit our community. 

I'm not here to defend my stance, either - I don't understand politics as much as most people here on Reddit.  But I think I'm much more aware of what I don't understand than most of the people on Reddit, too. I'm not going to respond to any comments but I will read them all and hope a good debate can come of this.

Thank you to everyone that gave me great advice on the counseling, I was really hoping that would make it work but no luck.  With what has been apparently going on behind my back there is no making this up.

I used the Cerberus Android security app, which we both had on our phones, to listen in to him &amp; her talking, listen to his wife calling him and him saying that he wasn't with my wife.  She repeatedly called him honey, said she was disgusted with me, etc.  So, put a pretty firm and brutal end to it today I would say.

Ah well...what are you going to do.  I never wanted to raise my son in a divorced household but it looks like that is what is going to happen now.  Everyone wanted follow up, and now here it is.

Throughout the whole semester I was struggling looking for a place to work. The Funeral Home I interned at basically told me to go kick rocks, so I turned to my College's career services guy. It was an okay experience, he helped me make a resume and we talked for a little bit about a few local funeral homes but the whole time I kept thinking, ""This guy doesn't really care, he's just doing his job..."" He gave me a couple leads to call regarding jobs and sent me on my way. 

I called every funeral home on the list and one of two things happened. They'd either straight up say ""We're not hiring right now."" Which I actually appreciated, because the other option was them saying, ""Oh, So-and-so is in a meeting right now, call back tomorrow."" Well by the 4th and 5th times calling back, it's pretty clear they're just jerking me around. 

So, I was casually browsing reddit one night, when I posted on my state's own subreddit. I basically just said, Hey I'm a mortuary student looking for a job with shitty hours and low pay. And I was contacted by one really nice guy. I won't say his name, but I hope he ends up seeing this somehow. He told me he had a couple friends that owned funeral homes and he would have no problem forwarding my resume to them. So I thanked him, but honestly, I wasn't expecting much. 

Two weeks later, I get a phone call from a well known and highly respected funeral home a couple towns over, they said they're looking for an apprentice and would like to set up and interview right away. 

The interview went on for two hours and went super well. I worked a wake with them the next day to see if it would be a good fit. I was nervous the whole time, but at the end of the day, the funeral director came up to me and said, ""We'd like to offer you the apprenticeship, come in tomorrow so we can discuss hours and your salary."" 

I was amazed, I couldn't stop smiling. Nothing has ever worked out for me like this, and I owe it all to that one super nice guy on Reddit. You really helped me out man. 

I start full-time this Monday, leaving my old job and all the stress that comes with it behind.

He did the things he loved. He loved and was loved by many. He was at times exasperating and inspiring... charming and maddening. He loved the sea, and it always called him back from where ever he might have seemed settled. We will miss him, but we won't be alone in that.

Edit: To all those wondering, it was a random act of violence. He was out with two female friends, and they got mugged. The guy started threatening the girls, and my brother intervened. As far as I know, he took bullets meant for the two women. More details to come as I get them. 

Edit2: We started to get a bit more information, but some is conflicting. He wasn't out with two female friends. He was out with a few male friends of his. They had just gotten out of a taxi when he saw two (three) men mugging either one or two women. He went to stop it, and he was shot in the neck.

Then you asked for some help. You were trying something on your bracelet when I turned your arm over and noticed the all too familiar pinkish-red scratches running from your bicep down to your wrists.

*I should say something.*

No, that would be unprofessional. But you seemed so nice. A cheerful customer, if not a little bit fragmented in the way you spoke. You seemed nervous. I remember that. 

You decided to go for the item. You want to wear it out. No problem.

*I should say something.* 

I took your details down, all the while thinking that I should just undo my cuffs, and roll up the white sleeve on the left arm of my shirt and show you my scars too. To show you mine had faded. To show you that it gets better.

I didn't know how to though. I then gave you a bag with the item's box in it, all the while using that simple action as a way to think of something to do, something to say.

I just wanted to let you know people care. Even if you're over it now, even though I don't know you, you don't know me, and we'll almost definitely never see each other again, I cared.

I cared enough that I haven't stopped thinking about it since you left work. 

I know when I used to feel that way, when I used to cut myself, when I used to think there was no reason for my being and that goddammit I should just fucking die already...

It would've been nice to know someone cared. 

So even though I know it wasn't my place, and you probably would've thought I was a piece of shit for bringing it up, because I don't know you; I don't know what you are going through, or what you went through...but I wish I had.

Just to let you know some people genuinely care.  

I hope you're okay.

I've spent almost a year living with his parents because he drained our bank accounts doing drugs. Up until I ended it, he kept telling me he loves me, I'm his best friend, and he didn't want to get divorced. He swears he doesn't even like her. He said she's fat, ugly, and legally she's a midget-why would he ever want her over me? But he won't stop talking to her. He'd rather spend several hours a night texting her than calling me and seeing how me and his infant son are doing.

I've spent over two years giving him everything I possibly could. And he did the one thing I never thought I'd have to worry about. I thought we would be okay. But while he was telling me how much he loves me, how happy I make him, he's telling everyone up at his living facility that we're getting divorced. 

And it hurts so bad. Here I am crying my eyes out, trying not to throw up and he's just going about his day accusing me of being the one that ruined us. Well, fuck you. FUCK YOU. Only assholes pull this type of bullshit. Only assholes act like it's their wife's fault they can't keep it in their pants. I'm so sorry I spent entire nights staying up watching you breathe to make sure you didn't O.D. after that seizure you had. I'm so fucking sorry I spent all my time believing your bullshit lies about how much you love me and how great I am and how I'm your best friend and how much you want us to be together. 

She can have you. Let her spend the rest of her life reminding you to take your fucking meds and listening to you point out which girls you've dated, fucked, or want to fuck you. Let her be the one to make all your doctor appointments and remind you to take a shower, do your laundry, brush your teeth, and act like a fucking normal human being. 

you literally threw away everything because you wanted the attention and you were lonely. You didn't think I'd find out. Then again, you obviously don't think. Fuck you. 

**Edit:** He's called. Now the story is, ""No, I haven't been talking to her. I still love you. Do you still love me? Do you want to work this out? I never wanted a divorce."" And my answer has been the same. ""Fuck you, asshole.""

**Edit 2:** From what I understand, this entire thing has been a manic episode and today was when he finally came down from it. When his meds ran out he just didn't get them refilled. However, I have no intention of going back on my word. I don't care what it was that pushed him to do what he did. I'm done. You don't cheat on your spouse.

I was over at my best friends house tonight. He and his GF had been drinking and went to bed, so I stayed up with a friend of his working on a massive puzzle. Sometime during the night I smelled something funny. It smelled like chemicals and I thought it was the printed puzzle pieces and ignored it. 20 minutes later the friend I was puzzling with asks me if I smell something funny, I tell him I think its the puzzle. He gets up to investigate and I follow. After looking through all the rooms in the house and finding nothing but this weird faint smell of chemicals we are stumped. The last room to check was the room of my best friend and his girlfriend. We open the door and a wall of biting smoke hits us. I turn on the light and can hardly see 2 meters infront of me. My friend runs to open the windows while I leave the room to cough my lungs out but immediately enter again and look whats burning. I can not find the cause and shout for my best friend and his gf to get the fuck up as something is clearly on fire. As hes been drinking hes passed out not responding. Im freaking out thinking they are already dead frantically search for the cause of the smoke. Through the smoke I then see glowing embers and realize my best friends blanket is on fire (it was black duvet so hard to see). I pick it up, burning embers falling everywhere and run outside with it. Run back and together with my puzzle friend we carry him and then his GF out into the kitchen. Open all the windows and check nothing else has caught fire. I then proceed to slap the fuck out of my best friend hoping to god hes not in a coma from the smoke. He slows comes to and so does his GF. 

They are ok and seem to have not gotton smoke poisoning. He is very lucky not to have 3rd degree burns only the top synthetic fabric of the duvet was slowly burning. I nearly lost my best friend cause he drinks and fell asleep with a cigarette in his hand. Had I not been there with my puzzle friend tonight I would have lost two very dear people. Tomorrow I will have a very long talk with him about his drinking habits, enough is enough, that and Im buying smoke alarms for my own apartment. Sadly in Germany they are not as wide spread as in other countries. 

tl;dr: Friend and his GF fell asleep while smoking. Cigarette lit duvet on fire, friend and his gf were too wasted and asleep to notice. Because I was up late with another friend at his house and smelled something burning we got them out in time. Buy smoke alarms!!! Dont smoke in bed EVER!!!

So after getting the first batch of cards from around the world, I sent a box of about fifty of them as a surprise. She absolutely loved them and spent the entire day reading them with her magnifying glass.

Later, I was exchanging messages with a Redditor [Charitythebestpolicy](http://www.reddit.com/user/charitythebestpolicy) who was sending a card, and he asked if I was able to visit her again. When I said that it wasn't likely (I'm a barista and airfare is...expensive) he generously offered to make it possible for me to see her again and hand deliver the rest of your cards. 

A couple of weeks after that I was on her doorstep, and I asked her to go outside and see if the other box I sent had been delivered. She opened the door a few minutes later, looked down to where a box would have been, then looked up to see me. I didn't give her a heart attack, so that's good, and we went inside to read cards and catch up the rest of the day, and the rest of the week. 

She got chocolates from Poland, Pineapple Lumps from New Zealand, hand knitted creations, handmade cards, and hellos from all around the world. My intention was to help her feel connected to the rest of the world when at times it can feel far too small, and you all helped me accomplish that with flying colors. 

I hope you all get to see your cards made it there safe, and thank you so so much.

I am 24 years old, I am not overweight and I have good hygiene.  You could say I'm just an average guy that never had any luck with girls.  Most of my time is spent in class and on my computer.  Last Friday my friends invited me to a party and against my better judgement I decided to go.  A friend introduced me to a few different girls and I spent most the party talking with one of them.  We had a lot in common and there was this chemistry between us.  Later that night when she asked to come to my apartment I was amazed.  I had girlfriends when I was in high school but not for most of my young adult life.  The farthest I have gone with a girl is kissing, and it was clear this girl wanted more.  She must have known I didn't know what I was doing and took the lead.  What happened next is the most heart crushing thing I have ever experience.  She pulled off my boxers, took one look at the size of my penis, and laughed.

After that everything is hazy.  I know she got dressed and left.  I remember throwing up and climbing into bed.  It's been three days since this happened and I've hardly left my room.  I feel a great pressure on my chest and a sick feeling in my stomach.  I knew my penis was smaller than the average but I never really thought much of it.

Last year I posted a thread about how I was assaulted on the street in Pakistan.

[The reddit post about my incident from last year](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ye63w/i_was_assaulted_and_threatened_to_be_killed_by_a/)

It's been a few months since then, almost a year, and things have had their ups and downs. I've had some threats, but nothing too serious like that last one. People shout at you on the street, which is normal in Pakistan, I get that. Or people insult me thinking I don’t understand them (I do understand), which isn’t a big deal either, but no physical assaults since then.


Otherwise, most of the people have been friendly. I’m having fun at a great new job; I’ve got great co-workers. Getting to know my huge family (Pakistani’s really do have HUGE families…).

Then yesterday my mother was coming home while I was at work and a man was standing outside our house on a motorcycle. He threw an envelope into the house and rode off, and when my mother opened it and took a look at it, it had three bullets in it and in Urdu a note that translates into: **'10,000,000 or Death'** (image below), meaning pay that amount or be killed.

**[Death Threat Image](http://i.imgur.com/vZYVO46)**

She called the police and the local enforcements, but they said there isn't much they can do. They said this is a common extortion method these days, usually ending in murder, or if the person pays they’ll continue to extort money from them.  Their next step will be to throw a grenade into my house to scare me to pay up, and the police can't do anything to stop a grenade, but they said they would try their best. They suggested hiring armed guards, which I can’t afford. 

They said each of the bullets represents each person living in the house, being my brother, my mom, and I.


I've filled out a police report, and a report with the DHA (which is kind of like the governing body of the area of the city I live in). Tomorrow I'll go fill out a report with the CPLC (Citizens-Police Liaison Committee, which is exactly what it sounds like).

I know this all sounds like propaganda against the country, but I'm not trying to create any, I’m just telling it the way it is. And many people have told me to sit down and accept it for what it is. I disagree. Completely. 100% disagree.


People should know, and why shouldn't they? Someone told me the other day not to tell my friends abroad about these things because it paints the country in a worse light than it already is, but come on.

Everybody tells me *‘Well this is Pakistan’*, so I guess by that ruling it’s okay to murder, rape, and promote terrorism because ‘This is Pakistan’, right?

When stuff like this happens I’m expected to say ‘that’s life! If I get shot, I get shot!’ I should just open my door and invite them in to kill me if that’s the case.

This is why this country just keeps getting worse and worse. This attitude that ‘It’s not our fault, you need to learn where you are’ is just the wrong way of thinking about it. I need to learn where I am because it’s your damn fault for letting these things get out of hand.

And I’m not talking about politics; I’m talking about the mentality and attitude of the people. This country is just falling apart. 

People here are batshit crazy. That’s about it. They just are. It must be something in the water, or something in the air, but people are just fucked up.

Not all of them, but quite a few. The funny part is no Pakistani seems to disagree with the above statement until an outsider says it, then patriotism hits them hard.

If I'm going to die anyway, someone might as well say it.


And I mean this is a really serious threat. The bullet is considered our death warrant; it’s not something to take lightly. People who’ve received these bullets get killed. And not just in the privacy of their homes, they will kill you in crowded, public areas.

I can’t afford to pay their demands; I don’t have that kind of money. It’s about US$100,000. I just don’t have it. 

And I really don’t know what to do at this point. We’ve left the house for now, I can’t say where too, reports have been filed, but I guess that doesn’t mean much here. 

What I’m trying to say here is that I’m just sick of it. I’m really sick and tired of the insults and the threats and having my life in danger every time I step outside. I’m sick of my family being in danger. Tomorrow, for all I know, I could be dead, my family could be dead. I’m not afraid of dying, but I’m just tired of it all. 

It’s just way too much.

Reddit, what can/should I do?


**EDIT/UPDATE 1:** 

Okay, so I'll update things as they go.

Our FIR (police report) needs to be refiled, the DHA gave us a letter that the police wanted translated into Urdu before we can get the FIR filed.

We've been told to wait it out and lie low until they get in touch with us again. Which could either be through phone (you just pay off someone in a phone center and they can get you any number), or another note.

I don't know. So far, we're alright, that's all that matters. We're not going to let them scare us, but we will be keeping our guard up. Tomorrow is a country-wide strike apparently, so maybe they'll try to contact us. 

*Fellow sane people in Pakistan*, If tomorrow is a strike, you guys know what that means, so I'll give a shout out to you guys who are here in this country with me, **stay safe yourselves**, you know how those days are.

And finally I'd like to thank all you guys for the support I'm getting from reddit. I've been showing my family your postings and they are very grateful. I will be responding to some of the comments directly, but I'll sum up some stuff here.

1) Getting out of Pakistan, yes, I think at this point it's safe to say it's time to go, or at least try. Funds are an issue but to get the family out we'll figure it out.
2) We have talked about taking asylum/becoming a refugee, and a lot of you guys gave us some good advice on it. We'll have to (as someone down there said) 'lawyer up' and see what happens.
3) On getting a firearm; We were given this advice by the police/DHA as well. I know in this country it's probably something one should do, but we don't want to be put in that situation. I'm sure guns are expensive too.

I'll keep updating as things go. Right now we're just waiting to see what's next. 

**EDIT/UPDATE 2:**

So they still aren't giving us a police report, luckily we filed our complaint with the CPLC and they said they'll get the report for us (I mean it's been almost a week...this is ridiculous).

Weekend was really quiet, stayed indoors, haven't heard anything yet unless theres another note lying at my house that we don't know about. I didn't want to post an update unless something big happened. I'll respond to some of the comments slowly.

It's just odd, I think the panic and stress from *waiting* to hear from them is worse than actually hearing from them. My brain has literally been on overdrive the past couple of days and I feel burnt out.

**EDIT/UPDATE 3:**
CPLC said we're not getting an FIR. They said they want to wait for the 2nd threat/contact before we'll get one, and they suggested *moving back into our house* for this. All we have is our complaint letter filed with the police and the one we filed with the CPLC (both were stamped as acknowledgement of receiving the complaint, so that's all we've got so far).

We're going to keep trying to get that FIR, hopefully without having to expose ourselves to said extortionists/ murderers.

**EDIT/UPDATE 4:**

They just showed up at our house.

My mom hired someone to stay at the house, and he's been saying the past few days a guy comes by the house a few times at night and just stops outside, revs the bike and leaves.

He just called and said a group of people on bikes arrived and are demanding to be let in.

We've called the police, the CPLC, the DHA, our home alarm company, everyone we could think off. The guys got away by the time they arrived, but because they weren't let in, everyone agrees they'll make another attempt tonight or within the next day or so.

I'll be updating as things develop. It's 10:23pm Pakistan time.

**EDIT/UPDATE 5:**

This is really bad, they are saying this isn't normal extortionist behavior to keep coming by the house like this. It is probably something deadlier than that.

**EDIT/UPDATE 6:**

Here's what we know, someone has been watching us for a while. They know our movements, they know how many people we are.

From what the guy we hired said, the guy walked up to the gate and already knew how to address the guy (people from different regions are addressed by different terms), so somehow they've been keeping a constant eye on the house, enough to know within a few days what region the guy guarding our house is from.

These people don't plan on kidnapping us, the police said they would have had plenty of chances for that, and they don't plan on taking money from us. They said they want to kill us to take something from us. It could be to take claim of the house.

They said this isn't normal for extortionists, even the DHA said this isn't normal for extortionists, they said the fact they boldly approach the house like this and demand to be let in, and that they keep coming back and parking outside tells them that this isn't a normal case. They are just too damn open about this  That topped with how extremely observant they've been makes no sense to the police.

We're on the phone with the CPLC right now, they are saying this is a very strange case, they are taking it to a higher level because they said the same thing the police said, this behavior isn't normal for extortionists. They said it's just really strange. 

I am really freaked out now. My family is really freaked out. We don't know what the hell is happening.

Them constantly telling us it isn't normal and that it's a strange case is much worse than them just being extortionists.",,False,,t5_2qh96,1371758689.0,,,True,t3_1g79ci,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1g79ci/my_family_received_a_serious_death_threat_and_we/,

So...today I got the news nobody want to get: I'm terminal. Got about 1 year left, at best 1 and half.

Want to know the real joke? I'm 26. Yeah...fuck you too life. I'll take solace in the fact that I probably will be done with my PhD in biochemistry before my death. Yeah, yeah, one of these wunderkids me, that's besides the point. At least I'll still learn something before I die, even though I won't get to use it. Meh, whatever.

Sure, I might just drop everything and start living the party life until the last second, but you know what? Thanks, but no thanks. I'll go about my life as I did every day.

There's nothing special except for the fact my life is shortened. Everybody dies, I lucked out and drew the short straw. 

Suicide probably is an option, an easy and painless one at that. Got nitrogen and helium around here, a plastic bag, and g'bye. Or even better is the fact that my father is an insulin dependent diabetic. Fun stuff. Inject a whole vial, go to sleep, over and out.

But nah, I don't feel like it just yet. Probably might look into assisted suicide though. We'll cross that bridge when the time comes. I'll hang onto life as long as I can physically bear it. Everybody deserves to die in dignity, that means no pain.

Well shit...mindless ramble, just writing down thoughts that cross my mind right this second. You'll have to forgive me if it's incoherent. 

Yes, it's a throwaway. My girlfriend and my family are all Redditors, so they'll immediately know otherwise. They don't need to know just yet. I'll prepare meself a week or so and probably go ""Oh by the way, I'm gonna die next year."". Yes, I do need to make a joke out of it. It's a coping mechanism for me.

Before you ask: No, I'm not afraid of my certain death. Though this certainty surely do messes up my thoughts. But I'm really glad I'm not afraid. I always was sure, when my time comes, I won't be afraid. I don't know why, or where this conviction came from. It was just there, and I stood by it.

Please excuse any grammar or spelling errors as I have been drinking tonight. 

I ask all of Reddit to please not let your friends drink and drive. I stopped my childhood friend who I met in Kindergarten (We are both 25 now) from driving home tonight. We had 4 people playing beer pong and we played 10 games. 

I drink a lot more than him, I am not wasted but I also knew I shouldn't be driving. It took a lot of convincing and lying to get him just to stick around for 5 more minutes.

Sure enough he ended up puking and passed out very shortly after on the couch. 

He is back in town to visit his parents and they literally live 2 minutes away. I have never seen a cop EVER between his house and the one I am living at now. 

But I could of save some innocent live tonight or his for all I know. 

So please Reddit, the DUI, the life, the car, the getting home so your parents don't worry, ITS NEVER WORTH THE FUCKING RISK. Stand up to them. It is always better to be safe than sorry. 

TL;DR Reddit don't let your friends drink and drive. Nothing bad in the story above happened and I hope all of you do the same. ",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_1bcp0w,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1bcp0w/my_plea_to_reddit/,

Tomorrow I'll compile all the leads provided here and start seeing where they might take me as the next few weeks go by. I have a strong feeling that I won't need to 'celebrate' my 15th anniversary of pain, and I genuinely hope that I'll get to write another post letting all of you know that, with your help, I found my answer.

Take care, everyone.

---

I don't know what I'm looking for by posting this. I suppose this is me searching for help from anywhere before I give up and crawl back into the lonely world I've built for myself. But I need to do this while a part of me still wants an answer.

I'm hurting, reddit. A lot. Since I was 9 years old I've suffered from an acute, chronic pain in my knees. That's roughly 5000 days - an unbroken chain of painful mornings and agonizing nights which has been a full 60% of my entire life. I've counted each new year as a growing majority, and as I approach my 23rd birthday it kills me inside to admit now that I've had more moments in pain than not.

My childhood was stunted by this terrible development. For that first year I was so lost in this pain that I thought of little else. I got older. By 13 I'd learned how to compartmentalize my consciousness: my day-to-day pains were isolated in the corner of my brain, and for a time I was able to ignore it. It was always there though, and by the end of each day I'd cry myself to sleep, praying to God to just wake up the next morning feeling better.

That prayer was never answered. The pain hit a new level at 16, but by this point I'd gotten so good at hiding it from everyone that absolutely nobody knew. I could smile as I walked, sit in class and pretend that I was paying attention, or even talk theology or philosophy or politics with my friends... but by this point in my life I had hit another 60%-milestone: by now, the majority of my brainpower was directed to blocking out/covering up the pain, and I had far less capacity for being a friend or a son.

My mom must have noticed my condition, because she convinced me to enter into physical therapy during my senior year. I went, I did everything I was asked to do. It was during those sessions that we discovered two important facts: first, that they couldn't help me; second, that I had stopped feeling pain in other parts of my body. I couldn't feel anything else, really. There was my leg pain and nothing. The therapy didn't ultimately fix me, but it helped me understand how deeply this problem had infected me. The pain had become a constant buzzing permeating my thoughts, a wall no other event or sensation could bring down. I had half my face torn off a few months later in a car accident (I lost enough blood that I couldn't stand for two days), and not even *that* overpowered the pain in my legs. And yet, compared to what I deal with now, all of this was child's play.

I went to college in the fall of 2006. The combination of walking across campus and living on the fifth floor of the dorms nearly drove me to suicide. I discovered yet another peak of burning agony... I surrendered to it seven weeks later and dropped out, but not until today have I ever come clean and openly admitted that this pain was what pulled me out of school. No, I was always more comfortable telling people that I wasn't smart enough or that I just didn't care about an education. Any answer was preferable to letting someone in, letting them understand how bad I was hurting.

And ever since, I've been living in a world slowly being devoured by this pain that I'm always drowning in. I started running a few years ago in defiance - I decided that, since I was going to be crying myself to sleep no matter what I did, I may as well run 6 miles a day. So I did. I even joined the Air Force for a while (which didn't work out for entirely separate reasons; no one in basic training ever noticed that I was in excruciating pain).

I got back on top of my pain in 2009. I rediscovered my dream of being a writer, I started chasing girls, and I tried as hard as I could to ignore my pain and just be happy. But in the spring of last year - almost exactly 13 years after all this started - something snapped and the pain came back worse than ever before. Suddenly I was stumbling as I walked, collapsing when a knee gave or a foot screamed out. Before I had time to realize how bad it was I'd already discovered the numbing effects of alcohol. And with rare exception I've been drinking every night for almost a year. My dreams have taken a backseat to the reality of the harshness of what I'm doing to myself.

I need serious help. I just completed a round of appointments with a knee specialist. The X-rays came back negative for any compelling cause of my pain. And so did the MRIs. This morning they requested that I go back into physical therapy, but it would cost me over $100 a week and there's no way I can afford that, and I just don't trust physical therapy to fix me. I turned them down and limped away. It hurts so much more than any physical pain to learn at last that - apparently - my legs are fine, especially after 13 years of horror.

I don't know what to do now. The only solution I have is to sink deeper into alcohol, since it appears to be the only method to dull the pain. But I'm not an idiot. It's not a solution by any means. Can any of you point me in the right direction? Is there something I haven't tried? Can anyone here help give me some hope? I want so badly to wake up and feel nothing, to be able to make it into the shower without limping every single time. Please help me if you can.

**Edit:** (and sort of a tl;dr) I would first like to thank all of you for extending such a wealth of well-wishes and possible forms of treatment. I'm putting together a massive list of everything and will begin a renewed search for answers on Monday. Also, I wrote the main post while very emotional, and I seemed to leave out some of the, well, more pertinent facts, such as diagnosis history and actual descriptions of pain. Here it is:

*9 years old: Throbbing pain in feet. Family doctor could not diagnose; sent to orthopedist who put me through physical therapy and made orthodic insoles for my feet. He diagnosed me with Osgood-Schlatter's disease and said that the pain would go away once I'd stopped growing.

*~17: Done growing, pain is worse than ever before. Now I have shin splits, burning agony in knees and feet. A new doctor postulates that it could be Elhers-Danlos Syndrome, but this has never been proven. I enter into physical therapy for a period of roughly 6 months.

*Present: I can barely bring myself to walk now, and the ""feeling fine"" facade is starting to crumble. I've just finished a few rounds of visits to an orthopedic surgeon, who has performed the first X-rays on MRIs on my knees. Nothing has shown up, and he wants me to go back to physical therapy.

We get to stay and watch as the entire front of house staff takes stacks of cash home and we get to mop the floors. The moral of the story is this: The next time you meet a cook, thank them.

1351801820.0,554,self.self,12h5ir,I made a website that turns First World Problems into donations for Third World Countries! Can you help me get the ball rolling?,ThunderingNuisance,737,183,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/12h5ir/i_made_a_website_that_turns_first_world_problems/,"A while ago, I started thinking about how First World Problems are a really popular thing on reddit and around the internet. We all think they're hilarious, because we're so guilty of all of these relatively minor annoyances. But I figured there must be a way to actually use the popularity of this idea to help out the people who don't have these issues.

So I created **[AllTheProblems.com](http://alltheproblems.com/about)** - a website where you can post First World Problems, and all the profits from advertising go to a charity that creates wells in Africa for communities that need them. I set it up so each person's account keeps a tally of the views that their posts receive, then converts those views into a dollar (USD) amount that represents how much their account has 'donated' thus far. Each post has a similar tally.

I want to be clear here: I'm not attempting to take advantage of reddit's humanitarian side for personal gain; I will not be making a profit on this site. I just wanted to do a good thing for people who need help. 

There are very few posts at the moment, but if it starts taking off, I can see the site generating several thousand dollars a year. According to the charity I'm using (the Blood:Water Mission), a **$1 donation gives one person in Africa enough water for an entire year**. Imagine the difference we could make just by complaining about our great lives!

This mother did not know her daughter's friend was black for 2 years, simply because the daughter refused to mention it. I think that's bogus. 

Being black, Asian, Indian, or anything else is a fact. It's more than likely the easiest way to single them out when referring to them in the third person. If in a room full of Chinese men, there was one female who was of German descent, it'd be so easy to either say, ""the woman"" or ""the white person"". It's much more efficient and frankly more honest and forthcoming.  By intentionally avoiding the obvious, it's actually slightly offensive in its own right. I quite like being black. I like the ""black culture"", I like the innate sense of unity I have with other black people. Don't sell me short because you think you're doing the right thing. 

Racism is having a dislike or disregard for someone based solely on race. Hate  all niggers and wetbacks? That's racist.  Acknowledge that someone has a different genetic make-up as a distinguishing feature? That's rational.

My first pick was my step-sister. To be accurate, ex-step-sister. We used to be best friends, but I moved years ago, and since then we'd call every 6 months or so, just checking in. Every time we talked, it was like we were just picking up where we left off. I hadn't seen any posts from her in a while, and I realized that we hadn't talked in nearly 2 years. My life had gotten really busy with moving, my career, friends. The second I thought about her, I missed her. When I brought up her facebook page, all I saw were posts from her friends talking about how much they wished she was still around. Not a good sign.

Before I go further, and before you can judge her (or me) overly harshly, I'm going to tell you a few stories. If any of you realize who I am from these stories, please don't say anything. I made this account because I needed this to be anonymous. I haven't written anything like this in a while, so I apologize in advance if my stories seem disjointed, or if this isn't the quality of writing reddit expects.

**First, an introduction.**

When I was 12, my parents got divorced. It was messy and terrible, and I didn't have the maturity to deal with it well, and my parents were expecting me to make all the decisions for my 6 year old brother and me while they were pulling all the emotional tricks in the book. My mother had been cheating on my father with a farmer. She married him, and he had a daughter that was 8 months older than me. At first, it was very awkward. I was fat. She was skinny. I was a girl that had no idea how to be a girl. She wore skirts. I was a computer geek. She was a social butterfly. I wasn't good with rules. She got straight A's. We clashed.

Eventually, we grew to respect each other for our differences. It didn't take too terribly long. When you're living on a farm in BFE and there's not much else to do, you learn to get along with whoever you're stuck with. Over time, I learned she wasn't quite the perfect princess that I had been led to believe. She was just a lot better at hiding her rebellions than I was. We got into so much trouble together. Or, more aptly, I got into a lot of trouble, as her dad couldn't ever believe she'd do anything wrong. It wasn't her fault, and she never tried to blame me for anything. It's just how it was. 

Now, for a few stories. Some more entertaining than others, but these are the things I remember the most. They are in chronological order.


**Story #1:**

We were 13. Although I had a computer, it only ran MS DOS 6.22. Her new step-dad had a fancy computer that ran Windows 3.1 and had AOL, so I would constantly go over to her mom's house so I could be on the internet. Yeah, I know. Really, it was the only option at the time. This is before ISPs were a thing, especially in rural areas. 

I remember the first thing I read on the internet in a chat room: ""I make slapping noises when I dance naked in the rain.""

I was appalled, being a socially and otherwise inexperienced nerd, but she was intrigued. She started typing back at the guy, although I can't recall what she said. We laughed about it for years. When she went to sleep that night, I booted up the computer again and logged back on. I sat there until the 10 free hours was completely used up. She woke up that morning and freaked out, until I pointed out I had a stack of 10 free hour AOL floppies. She got over it, and then she taught me how to play Doom.


**Story #2:**

We were 15. It was a typical hot summer in the midwest, and my mom didn't really believe in turning on the air conditioner to properly cool our 100 year old farm house. We were lying on the trampoline in the sun trying to tan. I'm super pale and can't tan, but I hadn't accepted that at that point. She was able to tan easily, and I was so jealous. I was reading a book out loud to her, and she sat up and took off her sunglasses. 

""I have some pot. We should try it.""

I hadn't ever really considered anything like that. She'd just got her first real high school boyfriend, and he was 16, so she was always out spending time with him. I was alone on the farm, and she was really my only friend. I couldn't figure out the social system at school, so I'd just given up. I was so happy anytime we got to spend time together. Besides that, I had a curious mind, and I liked things that sound like trouble, so I agreed.

I remember sitting there smoking a poorly rolled joint behind the barn, hoping our parents didn't come home. She asked me if I felt anything. I didn't. She said that she did, but I suspected she was lying. I was glad my first time trying this was with her. I never worried about being weird around her.


**Story #3:**

We're 16. Our parents have now refused to let us close the door to my bedroom when we were in there, because we might be ""scheming"". They were right. Her dad got her an old thunderbird. I was driving my mom's pontiac grand-am. We would race as fast as the cars would go down a 2 lane road in the middle of the country. Her car always won, but I didn't care. It felt good to drive fast and to risk so much. We would go to her room every night and watch Tank Girl or listen to Hole. It was the 90's. She taught me about riot grrl music. She showed me the best role model I'd ever find in Tank Girl. When we went to sleep at night, we'd quote lines from the movie back and forth, giggling uncontrollably.


**Story #4:**

I installed Linux. She'd been trying to learn along with me, but computers weren't really her thing. I hacked a few porn sites with an imapd exploit. Credit card numbers were obtained. We used them to buy each other flowers. It was not our most intelligent move, but we were never caught. As we grew bolder, things progressed. She would find a house that was abandoned but still in good repair, and I would buy books with the credit card numbers and send them to that house. We were not good teenagers. We never meant to cause harm, but we never really thought our actions through. The first book I ever illegally bought was TCP/IP Illustrated, Volume 1. The first book she ever illegally bought was an unauthorized biography of Courtney Love. She bought some miracle substance from High Times that would supposedly allow her to pass a drug test. I don't know if it worked. Probably not, but somehow she managed to maintain a job through her teenage years. I lasted a week at Hardees before rage quitting.


**Story #5:**

She was smoking pot with her boyfriend most of the time. I would smoke sometimes, but it wasn't really my thing. Sometimes we would go out and lay on the trampoline at night and do acid. We'd talk about all kinds of things. She used one of the credit cards to buy a handheld tape recorder, and when she wasn't there, I'd speak into it, telling stories. She loved to hear me talk. She loved to hear me sing. She was the only person who ever told me I was good at these things. She made me believe her. She told me I was amazing. She helped me build my self esteem. I hated myself, and I hated my life. She got me through it. She told me I'd either end up incredibly successful or on America's Most Wanted. I really don't think I'd be here today if it wasn't for her.

**Onward.**

I left when I was 17 to pursue my career. It was a good move for me, but I hated leaving her behind. We'd talk every once in a while, and we'd reminisce about old times. I tried to get her to move with me, but she was afraid to leave the area where she grew up. She had so much family there. I had so very little that it was easy for me. I didn't blame her for this, but it made me sad. I knew she could get so much more out of life if she'd just try.

She told me I should write a book about our exploits. We joked about passing it off as fiction, because there were just too many illegal things that we did. The stories above were the tamest of the bunch. ""Remember when..."", she'd start. She'd tell me something I had forgotten all about, and we'd laugh and shake our heads. How did we get through those years acting like we did? We would agree that we were both so incredibly lucky. 

As the years went on, she got married, had a beautiful daughter - but the child had seizures when she was being born, so she ended up having some problems. She went on to go to school to be an RN, the same thing her mother did. It was tough, but she was getting through it. I visited when her child was first born. I was worried, because I couldn't imagine having a child that wouldn't ever be able to be independent. I was worried she wouldn't be able to handle it. She seemed so much stronger than I ever could have been in that situation. I thought she was doing OK. Now, it looks like I was wrong.

The first google hit that came up for her name was a story from last year about how she had been caught with heroin and other drugs in jail. It had her mug shot. It looked nothing like her. She looked so old... so broken. So not like the girl I grew up with. I didn't understand how the person I knew had been reduced to a crappy headline, a bad photograph, and a news story that most people will shake their heads at while they ask themselves what the world is coming to before clicking to read the next page. I read the story again, and I realized it mentioned a prior felony. I kept digging.

I found the obituary. It was dated from a year ago. It said she died in her home, but it didn't say how. It was a private funeral. I kept digging.

I found another news article stating that she'd died of a heroin overdose. I stopped digging.

I posted on her facebook wall, and one of her friends that I'd met during my visit 7 years ago sent me a message, asking me to call. I did. I was told a story that I'm still having a hard time believing. 

A few years ago, she was caught with coke in her car. It was probably right after the last time I had talked to her. I didn't know she'd been doing coke. I was told by her friend that she'd had a pretty serious coke problem for a while, but it was kept quiet, only a few people knew, and she got over it. Or so they thought. She turned herself in later for some traffic related offenses, and they found the drugs on her. Who does that? Who has to be in that state of mind to think that going into a jail cell voluntarily with drugs on their person is a good idea? No one knew she'd been doing heroin. Not her family. Not her husband. Not her best friend. 

They sent her to boot camp for 9 months. They shaved her head. She had beautiful hair that I was so envious of when we were growing up. When she got out, she went home to her husband and her daughter. Everything seemed like it might be getting better. She was acting normal. She had graduated. She was an RN.

One morning late last year, her husband and her daughter walked into the bathroom, and she was dead on the floor. She had taken heroin that night, and she must not have realized that after being off of it for so long, her body couldn't tolerate whatever dosage she'd been taking before. She died of a heroin overdose.

I don't know what to think. I don't know what to do. This happened a year ago, and I didn't know. I miss her so much.",,False,,t5_2qh96,1342153047.0,,,True,t3_whbxf,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/whbxf/i_just_found_out_my_partner_in_crime_died/,

Throughout the presentation he detailed a history for his company that was a total lie and claimed he didn’t know of any competitors. Though my brother has improved his belts since he started, here is an image comparing my brother’s original belt and theirs [http://imgur.com/nKSuFZY](http://imgur.com/nKSuFZY) (Shark Tank show info: [http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-detail/episode-422/1090835?page=4](http://abc.go.com/shows/shark-tank/episode-detail/episode-422/1090835?page=4) )


**Details and background:**


About 7 or 8 years ago my older brother started a business selling a very different type of belt, one without holes and that uses a sliding or ratchet type mechanism. It was something he had seen in Europe while serving a mission for our church. This type of belt is somewhat more common there but had been largely unavailable in the US. When he showed my family the belts and he saw how much we liked them he decided to start a little business selling them.


For a while he really only sold them through friends, family and acquaintances. But it naturally built up momentum and after starting a website and doing some online sales he realized there was real potential for this business. It was around this time that he went to one of our cousins for advice—this cousin had a lot of experience in business and was someone we all kind of looked up to. He gave him some good tips and pointed him in the right direction. They carried on a correspondence like this, my brother sending an email every 6 months or so, for a couple of years. Here is a college newspaper clipping of my brother entering into a speed pitch competition with his belts back in 2008 -- [http://imgur.com/Q0FIsb4](http://imgur.com/Q0FIsb4)


Cut to 2012, his belt business is doing well. It’s still relatively small, just he and his wife now, but it got to the point where the demand fueled a necessity for growth—and grow it did. During this time a few competitors began popping up, including MissionBelt.com, but that was never an issue for them. Competition is healthy and business continued to grow regardless.


2012 was a big year for them and he ended up leaving his full time job to focus on the belts.  Plus, the growth seemed to come at the perfect time and my brother was able to offer our parents just enough work to help them make ends meet (our dad had lost his job and had been looking for work for quite a while).


My brother was stoked. But then he was hit with a bombshell from an unlikely assailant, our cousin.


On the April 26th 2013 show of Shark Tank, our cousin (the brother of the cousin he had sought business advice from) showed off a belt and company that he claimed to be the result of a unique idea that came to him. Throughout the presentation he detailed a history for his company that was a total lie. But the most gut wrenching part of the show was when our cousin claimed that he didn’t know of any competitors.


I don’t watch the show but the morning after it aired one of my other brothers called me and told me to watch and said I would be shocked. What I saw left me feeling sick. The belts my cousins are selling are an exact copy of the ones my brother originally started selling back in 2007 (comparison [http://imgur.com/nKSuFZY](http://imgur.com/nKSuFZY) ). The fact that my cousins had founded Mission Belt (along with a few other people we know and grew up with) and kept it a secret was such a shock to say the least. For me, the most painful part of all this has to be the depth of their deception. Just a couple months before the show our entire extended family was together for my younger brother’s wedding, including these same cousins. I sat and talked with them for hours, all the while they kept this secret. My younger brother had even been living with one of their brothers for the last year! 


I’ve brought the story to Reddit because people should know the truth and I wanted to show my brother (a fellow redditor!) some support. I know this whole thing has taken a big toll on him. That feeling of being betrayed by someone you love is profound. 


My cousins, who founded and own Mission Belt, stabbed my brother in the back. They lied to and manipulated extended family to keep their company a secret, and now lie to every one of their customers. I recently read an article that one of my cousins wrote (source: [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nate-holzapfel/be-yourself_b_3460777.html](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nate-holzapfel/be-yourself_b_3460777.html) ) about “being the best you” and his first suggestion is to stop chasing other people’s dreams…


Mission Belt says they believe it to be their “corporate responsibility to give something back to hard working individuals,” but what they don’t say is they will lie, cheat, and steal to line their pockets along the way.

I just felt the need to put this out there and give credit to one of the most under-appreciated occupations out there.*

**EDIT:** *I'm glad that many people see that this is just to honor nurses (ER and otherwise) as well as anyone else that works in the medical field.  I'm not looking for a personal thanks to my wife (though they are appreciated!) rather a random thank you to someone you may know or meet that is a nurse.  Others must just have a really boring life to have nothing better to do than complain about a post on a web forum.* 

Throughout my employable life thus far, I have held 4 of the 5 hardest jobs to do outdoors in the summer.  Three of these are on the [Top 10 Most Dangerous Jobs in America (2007)](http://s1.hubimg.com/u/103475.gif) list.  I have had guns pulled on me not once, but twice.  I have worked 17 hour days while standing on hot asphalt in the 100 degree summer heat.  I have balanced precariously off the edge of a roof 50' in the air while swinging a hammer with no safety lines.  However, you could never get me to do the job my wife does every day without complaint.

My wife is an ER nurse.
She is on her feet 12 hours a day, often without a break or even a bite to eat.  She treats and comforts grandmothers whose children no longer care enough to come see them when they are lying on their bathroom floor with chest pain all alone.  She sees the last breath of a car accident victim, father of three on his way home from work, bleeding out after being hit by a drunk driver.  She cries for the 6 month old baby girl brought in, now blue and covered in bruises, that is no longer able to cry.  She comes home from work sometimes in tears for what she sees... sometimes exhausted and in pain from having to perform CPR on a homeless man for 20 minutes...  sometimes traces of blood still on her scrubs from when a sick woman vomited blood all over her while being trached.  She deserves a thousand trophies, a medal, and the utmost respect from the people she saves on a daily basis.

But the reality is, for every person she saves, widow she comforts, and Depends she changes, there are a dozen people yelling at her for having to sit in the waiting room for that 20 minutes longer while she is frantically pumping the chest of a dying patient because their toe hurts, the coffee is crappy, or ""why did you call me here from the casino and how can you just pick up a 16 year old up with an ambulance without his parents there?!""

I post this to try to bring a little realization to those not aware how important those in your ER are and the type of job it is.  I've always known it is an honorable job, but didn't know the extent until I married my wife.  My wife doesn't understand quite the extent of the respect and appreciation I have for her because I can never form it in words quite right, so this was my best effort.  An effort to get everyone else to treat your local ER RN with respect, know the work they go through and hope you never have to see the difficult side of the job in a bad situation.  Say 'Thank You', send a card, and never assume your time is more important than someone's life (that's why they have triage).

I see people with ""My son is a Marine"" bumper stickers.  People in the armed forces protecting this country wear a uniform and get people shaking their hands and thanking them for keeping our country safe.  But my wife is just like every other mother walking around the grocery store with a screaming baby on her days off.  Think about that the next time you want to yell at someone for taking too long in line at the deli.  One day on the most vulnerable day in your life that person may be fighting for it when no one else will.  Because it's her job.

Here's why:",Son_of_a_mother,866,331,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/bvgha/reddit_i_spent_the_better_part_of_the_day_with/,"Five years ago my Dad, a janitor by trade, died an early death at the age of 50. He did't leave a lot behind; mostly a lot of debt and the large family he sometimes worked 3 jobs to support, but he also left a life insurance policy big enough to settle his debts and cover meager living expenses for a few years.

So here's my Mom who dropped out of college 25 years ago to start a family, and who only ever worked some part time jobs to help make ends meet... She's got 3 grown kids and 2 still at home. The small company she worked for, occasionally, throughout the years has recently failed and disappeared. She has no real resume and few opportunities for work. That was 5 years ago...

Since then she has lost a lot of excess weight, continued to raise her youngest kids, sent one daughter to college, helped plan and execute 3 weddings for her oldest children, attended 3 births and played a big part in the lives of 3 new grandchildren, overcome some big life-threatening medical hurdles, and dealt -the whole time- with the crippling pain of losing her spouse and soul mate.

Two years ago today she got her bachelors degree from a respected private university with a high GPA; an impressive feat for anyone to have accomplished, let alone somebody at her age and in her situation.

But today.... *Today she received her Masters degree and is set to launch a new professional career at almost 50 years old!* I saw this all happen over the last five years, but until today I had never given it much thought. I mean, it was just my Mom doing her thing until today. Today I cried. A lot. I still am.

tl:dr Life told my Mom to lay down and die, but she got up and pwned it instead.

Thank you for letting me share this.

**Edit:** I just compiled your responses and emailed them to her. Thanks for all of your kind words.

**Edit:** She replied:

Wow. I don't know who that lady is that you wrote about, but she sounds pretty amazing to me too. I think I've also got something in my eye. 

Thanks for the kind words. At times I seriously thought I wasn't going to make it, but I just took one day at a time and it all worked out with a little encouragement from family and friends and I'm sure a lot of help from the other side.

My new boss died while I was on vacation, and I just don’t know how to feel. I just got transferred to this project a couple months ago, and before that I only had a cursory relationship with her. I only knew her face, not her name or what she did. Since then, I’ve got to know her some professionally. She was a good boss - lenient when she could be, while expecting results. She bought our team pizza once. When I had a bad cold, she told me to take an extra day off if I had to. She died from “complications from the flu.” Did she take a day off?  

Who dies from the flu these days? The elderly and children. She wasn’t either- she was in good health, a runner. She was one of those ageless asian women who could be anywhere between 25 and 55. I think she had kids. I’m not sure how old they are.  

I’m sad that I don’t have a chance to get to know her better, to have her as my boss for longer. I feel guilty because I keep thinking how this is going to affect my career and work. I hope my old boss isn’t assigned to us. I was hoping and expecting an overdue promotion after my next review. I was supposed to get a new, permanent office. When will I get one now? I hope it isn’t hers.  

I got the call last night from the project lead. I was afraid that I was getting fired when he began with “I’m not sure how to say this...” Horrifyingly, I was kind of relieved when I found out what the news was. What kind of human being feels relieved at something like that? Does that mean I would rather she had died than get fired? Would I get fired if it meant saving her life? I’d hope so.  

What do you say when you find out your boss has died? I said “oh wow, that’s crazy.” A life deserves more of a response than that. My wife said the same thing. “Oh, crazy.” Then we proceeded to eat sushi and watch Pitch Perfect. Funny movie.  

I’m anxious to find out what’s going to happen with the project. The devil inside me is saying that this means that I’ve got a better chance of being sent overseas to install it. That would be cool. Will the project lead take over for her? I get along with him. Might I become the new project lead eventually?  

Selfishly, I’m annoyed that I can’t really talk about the vacation I just came back from, or how my holidays went. I can just see it now. “How was your New Years?” “Better than my bosses, that’s for sure!” Yeah, right. I want to describe the beers I tasted, the sights I saw, the gifts I gave and got.
  
Work is infuriatingly normal today. Did everyone talk about it yesterday? What did I miss? When’s the funeral? Is this some elaborate prank? I peered in her office. It looks the same. Her sweater is on the chair.    

Our business culture just isn’t equipped to handle death. We aren’t equipped to handle anything real. We keep it superficial, and have no contingency plans for something like this. When stuff happens that breaks the charade, we run around like little ants after someone kicked over our anthill.

So, I'm beginning my normal morning trek to work.  I walk out to my car and I find an Escalade idling right behind my car.  There's no cars for two spots in either direction and there's nothing blocking the Escalade from the front or the back.  Essentially, she could be anywhere on the road, but she's in the one spot that blocks my car from getting out.

I go at first with the silent approach.  I'll just get in my car, throw it in reverse, and the driver (whom I can see is right there behind the wheel) will get the hint and scoot her SUV bak so I can get out.  Thirty seconds go by and she has not moved, so I back up a little.  Just an inch or so, hoping maybe the motion of my car will draw attention to my reverse lights and she'll move.  Still nothing.  I move another inch, and now I know she's watching me, because she *lays on her horn*.

In light of the silent approach failing, I get out and walk over to her car door.  She rolls the window down and says, ""Motherfucker you almost hit me!""  I reply with, ""You're blocking me in.  Can you just move ten feet back or forward so that I can get to work?""  I'm still being nice and polite here.  However, she replies, ""I'm waiting for my friend to come out.  I'm her ride today.  You think you the only one tryin to get to work today?""  ""Ma'am that's fine but if you could wait for her ten feet back, everything would be fine.""  ""Look motherfucker her apartment is right here and this is where I've been waiting and this is where I'm gonna wait and I'm gonna wait all day if she don't get her ass out here!  You need to move then go tell (whatever her name was) to get out here.""

I lost it.  I said, ""Just move your car.  She'll have to walk the same distance."" ""No."" ""MOVE YOUR CAR WHAT THE FUCK!"" ""DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT MOTHERFUCKER!""  ""I'm getting in my car now, and I'm going to start driving.  If you're still there, you're getting hit.  I'm tired of this shit.""

As I'm getting in my car, she moves.  I thought at first it was because I got the win.  Then I see a woman coming out of another building and the woman was backing up to her, who then got in.  This bitch was in front of the wrong building the whole time.

Three months later I'm on my way back from a trip to Florida to visit my wife's parents.  I've forgotten all about the altercation above.  Stopping for gas at an Exxon in South Carolina, the pump asks me if I want a car wash.  Eh, why the hell not?  I get my wash code on the receipt and pull around.  Currently there is an Escalade that is halfway into the car wash but is backing up for some reason.  The car then pulls forward again, almost to the sensor, only to start backing up again at the last second.  The lights are all saying ""Drive Forward"" as in ""Keep pulling up because you haven't hit the sensor yet.""  The sensor was on a tiny ramp that your wheel needs to be resting on top of before the machine starts doing its thing, but for four times now as I watched the Escalade keeps hitting the bump and backing up before being on it.

The fifth time, she backs up right out of the car wash and almost into me.  At which point the door swings open and a woman leans out looking at me.  I roll my window down and she says, ""You need to back up.  I have to start over and come in again.""  I said, ""No ma'am you just haven't driven up far enough.""  She closes her door, drives in again, hits the bump, and back up to me again.  Door opens again, ""It ain't working, you gotta move!""  I say again, ""Ma'am you need to be up ON the sensor before the car wash starts, you keep driving up to it but not on it.  You need to go just a little further.""  At this point another car is behind us, who rolls his window down and says, ""The sensor is a ramp.  You have to be on the ramp.""  The woman closes her door again and drives up.  She hits the bump, goes a tiny bit up the ramp, reverse lights come back on.  I shout, ""NO! JUST A BIT FURTHER! DRIVE! DON'T BACK UP!""  She doesn't listen and we're back at square one.

I'm literally getting out of my car at this point and about to ground-guide her onto the sensor (hopefully running out of there before the fun begins and I get soaped).  The car behind me is smashing his horn like he's tenderizing a pork chop.  Just as I stand up she yells, ""MOTHERFUCKER MOVE YOUR CAR I WILL WAIT HERE ALL DAY!""

Then it hits me.  I look at the car, I look at her.  I say, ""Wait.. a minute... don't I know you?"" ""No."" ""Yeah I do... aren't you that woman that blocked me in a month or so ago while parked in front of the wrong fucking building?""  ""NO that was NOT me!""  At this point, she slams her door shut, stomps the accelerator, and blasts through the car wash.  She hits the sensor ramp so hard that the left side of the car does a hop through the air.  She speeds right on through, out the other side, and dives into traffic to speed off.

At this point, the two of us remaining, me and the car behind me, are staring at the car wash entrance.  Instead of ""Drive Forward"" it now says ""Back Up""",,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,,True,t3_kd49k,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/kd49k/what_are_the_odds_of_this/,

This morning I found a phone stuck in my seat that I have concluded belongs to a French person (that actually lives in France), that was on their way up to Canada, possibly last week sometime.

I don't think the bus company or authorities would do much here as this phone doesn't even seem to work here (it's all in French without English as even an option, pin code locked, with ""Orange"" as the phone provider). It is a pretty nice (probably expensive) phone with what seems like a bunch of personal information on it so I figure the owner might want it back.

I am able to poke around on it and have found the contact list and entries for Mom and Dad (I actually had to look up how to say those in French to find them.. :-P ).

My question is, would anyone in France/the UK be able to call a number for me to let them know that I found this phone, and give them my email so I could have them confirm it's theirs and etc?

If anyone is able to do this, let me know and I will pm you the phone number and my email. Thanks!

Update: parigot called the person's mom in France and she gave her son my email address. He has already emailed me once and told me he will be in the US until Sunday (Not Canada or France like I thought). I responded and am waiting for further word now.

**Update: I have just returned the phone to its rightful owner! He came to my building with a Canadian friend(and she did have a cell phone, so that made it easier) and I met them outside. They also asked me for some sightseeing tips so I pointed them to some nice spots in the area(Financial District). I briefly explained what I did to get in touch with him and they both seemed quite astonished. I also emailed him this post so he can see it for himself and comment if he wants to.** 

**Thanks for the help reddit, mission accomplished!**

Bonus Update: He emailed me again a little while ago and here's what he said:

&gt;i wanted to thank you again for the phone.

My father frequents a motorcycle forum. Early this year a retired navy master chief was struck by a drunk driver with an expired license.  That driver was a Swiss foreign exchange student and pro-golfer named Sherlyn Popelka, who left him there to die on the road while she ate tacos at a food truck two blocks away, watching bystanders and paramedics save his life. Her response to the cops was ""He'll be alright, I'm only worried about my scholarship"".  He's been going through surgery for awhile now because of his injuries. She fled back to Switzerland during the trial to avoid jail.  A warrant is out for her arrest and hopefully the state department will attempt to extradite her.

Recently she hired a PR firm that told the forum owner to remove the thread concerning her. She's attempting the remove any mention of her illegal actions from the internet. 

She's still living in Switzerland and is regularly attending profession golf tournaments. She's sponsored by Nike and other sports brands.  We're hoping to spread the word about her so that her sponsors abandon her and she's eventually extradited back to the states.

Here's a news article about the accident: http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_d9a1934f-1614-5dc1-8f93-b4046f412bf7.html

Facebook protest page against her: http://www.facebook.com/boycottpopelka

Please help us spread the word about her, it's sickening that someone can get away with this and still be sponsored by large corporations like nike.

**TL:DR** Swiss golfer sponsored by Nike almost kills motorcyclist and flees to switzerland.

Edit: For clarification, it's not my father who was hit, it was a friend on the forum he frequents.

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dcjxc/what_should_we_30m31f_do_about_our_crazy/

We stopped interacting with her, and wouldn't answer the door when she occasionally came knocking.

She was just getting crazier and crazier, so we talked to the landlord about getting her evicted and he started the process. Unfortunately, it's a really slow process (by necessity, since I do believe in tenant rights, which have saved me from a bipolar landlord who kept calling me for more money because my girlfriend was sleeping over often). 

So because of this, she got really pissed off at the landlord and backed up her toilets, which started leaking downstairs, so plumbers had to come. That happened once a few weeks ago, and then again this weekend. This time it was so bad that sewage backed up into our washing machine (GROSS), so the landlord asked her to help pay for the plumbing costs.

My wife and I had just gotten home from work as the plumber was leaving. We were relaxing in the living room when I hear someone outside yelling, ""Do you need help? Is everything okay?"" and I hear my neighbor reply, ""Don't worry about it, I'm just smoking.""

I look towards the front of the house and see a pillar of smoke coming from the front of my house. I ran downstairs and she's standing outside her apartment, smoking a cigar and grinning her ass off while smoke is piling out of her front screen door. I open the door and there are books piled in the living room and set on fire, and everything around is flammable rugs, curtains, furniture.

FUCK! I tell my wife to call 911, grab our cat and put her in the car, and police pull up in just a minute, quickly followed by the fire dept. My wife asks her, ""Why are you doing this? We live here!"" and she says, ""Don't worry about it, it's between me and the landlord.""

God dammit, we were in the fucking house with our cat and all of our possessions, you fucking lunatic!!!

She admits to starting the fire and gets cuffed, but she's laughing as the fire department is running in to put out the fire. Fucking insane!!

Luckily, we caught it soon enough that there is no damage to our apartment. We were able to get back in later that night. We had to give witness/victim statements to the police. If we're lucky, we'll never have to see her again and she'll be in jail or a mental facility.

God damned, that shit was horrifying. If we weren't home, my cat could be dead and all of my stuff would be gone. We could have been killed if she started the fire in the middle of the night.

I've been at my job for 6 months, the longest I've held a job. I was homeless this time last year. And today I'm opening the shop - with my own set of keys - by myself! :)

**EDIT:**

Here's a bit of my story, since someone asked for elaboration. 

I've spent my entire life going back and forth between 2 places, one rural and one urban. I moved back to the city in the summer of 2011, but by October I'd quit my serving job and my uncle kicked me out of his house. I stayed with Occupy for a little bit, trying to do something good, but ran away to my mom's house when I got the opportunity. A couple months passed. Out of a need to get away from parents and be on my own, I took a bus back to the city with no plans. It was stupid, I know. 

I met a lot of interesting and crazy people- people who stole from me, tried to kill my friends. And I met people who made me weep from the kindness they offered. It was rough sleeping in the cold- occasionally I found warm places to sleep or shower. I came down with bronchitis once, and if it weren't for the help of an incredibly kind person taking me to a doctor and getting me medicine, I'd probably have been in a lot of trouble.

I was going to go train hopping across the U.S. in May 2012. I figured that if I were to be homeless, I might as well travel. But my partner stood me up and I was too afraid to go on my own. A very nice couple then took me in and gave me a room in their house so that I could get back on my feet. In June I got a job. I've been renting a room in a new place, on my own, since October. 6 months in and I'm opening the store, getting more responsibility. I have my own keys!! I've never had a set of keys before! I can't believe how my life is going.

My whole experience has changed me, for the better I think. I'm not the kid I used to be (I'm currently 21). I thank my lucky stars that I got through that, and am back on my feet. There are so many people out there who can't say that. And I can finally say that I'm happy with how my life is right now, because it could be a hell of a lot worse.


Thanks for listening to my story. :)

I saw a mountain today.

Trivial, i know. I see mountains all the time on this site, especially /r/earthporn. Gorgeous mountains, stunning vistas, and unimaginably beautiful landscapes. Not only there, but all over the place are images of assorted geological formations. Intellectually, i know what a mountain *is* and what it looks like. That knowledge did not prepare me for seeing one.

I've lived in Illinois my entire life, aside from a year I spent in Georgia. Everywhere I've ever lived or been has been flat. The only time I've left the flat portion of the States was a short trip to Phoenix, which is equally flat, for the most part, and i was stuck in an aisle seat during arrival and very drugged on departure. Ive never, with my own eyes, seen a mountain.

I was gifted with a trip to San Francisco by a friend. I was informed less than 12 hours before takeoff that i had a seat, so i had enough time for a nap and to pack before it was time to go. My friend was on a later flight, so i was traveling solo. Naturally, I treated myself to a window seat.

About three hours into the flight, I looked up from my book during a course correction and saw, suddenly, filling my view was an honest to god mountain. A giant mound of various rocks formed through assorted geological phenomena, and it was right there below me. And there was another one by it. And another one. And so many i couldn't count. Wait, no. Theyre all one massive formation. Theres no distinction between one or the other. And then i couldnt count because I couldn't see. Oh, God, why am I crying? More importantly, why cant I *stop* crying? No, I'm fine. Go back to your movie. I'll just continue staring, mesmerized, out the window. 

Today, I saw a town nestled in a valley and realized i have no frame of reference for those people's lives.

Today, i saw striations in ancient rock from a plane. I saw the effect of the rain shadow, something I've studied countless times in school.

Today, at 25, I saw my first mountain and realized just how little of the world i know.  And it was beautiful.",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_100ds8,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/100ds8/i_saw_a_mountain_for_the_first_time/,

The big difference is that he also had his father with him.  Granddad must have been only in his late 60s but had obviously been stricken early with Alzheimer's.  Physically though he looked like could have kicked ass back in the day.  He was tall and wiry and still had quite a bit of muscle on him.  The son was a pretty big dude himself but the main thing I noticed throughout their meal was the gentle care he took with his dad.  Granddad just stared straight down at the table and didn't say a word as his son patiently spoon fed him the ice cream that came with their meal.   Then when granddad had too much his son gently but firmly patted and rubbed his back to get the food to go down.  All the while he’s entertaining his daughters prattle and making small talk with the wife.  After the meal was over he gently took his dad’s arm and walked him out at a pace that seemed like it would take a lifetime before they would ever reach their car.  It’s one of those moments where you think you have fatherhood all figured out and then you see what it really takes.

I look over to my boss, who is staring stone-faced at the woman, who apparently has come in and steamrolled him (language barrier) into giving her free product more than once. I politely tell her that it costs $1.78, and she throws her debit card in the machine, telling me, ""I don't think there's money on this sweetie, but let's try."" It doesn't work, and I am pleasant and patient with her while she rummages in her purse for change. After huffing and puffing, she pulls up seventy-ish cents in nickels and pennies and says, ""Honey, you'll make-up the rest."" I say, quite plainly, ""Oh, you want me to buy your drink for you with the tips I share with my coworkers? Sure. No problem."" I decided to do this because there was a line forming behind her and she was likely to steal the mix anyway. I figured shaming her was as good as I was going to get. Anyhow, I pay for her drink with a toonie (O Canada) and move to put the remaining twenty-two cents in the tip cup. She reaches for it, I lightly move her hand to the side and say, ""No, that's MINE. If you come here again, you should be putting a nice big tip in there, and you're NOT getting anything for free again."" The thing is, people who feel comfortable soliciting free things from small businesses likely don't feel ashamed of themselves very often. So, I ask, if you are somehow dimwitted and think that it's cool to ask a serving person to do you a solid and spot you the difference when you come up short, you are only an asshole. I can tell when you have legitimately forgotten your card/are a few cents short and in those cases I don't mind helping you out. Non-grifters would never ask, so it is my pleasure to offer in that case, likely because you're a good customer and you'll come back.

She had gotten 2 and a half hours of sleep and the drive was an hour and a half. About fifteen minutes outside of her home city, she fell asleep at the wheel, swerved to the side of the road onto gravel, which she then overcompensated for and rolled her vehicle off of the road, into a concrete wall and under a bridge. The car was absolutely destroyed, but miraculously she walked out of the accident with nothing more than a few scratches and stitches. 

To all of the scientists and engineers at Toyota who helped design that vehicle to protect the passengers within to that degree, I am utterly, unfathomably, without words I am thankful. The ambulance came with a body bag because of how mangled the car looked, but somehow it was not needed. Thank you for protecting the one thing that is truly nearest and dearest to my heart..

To the engineers at Apple who designed the MacBook Pro, thank you for designing a system that, despite being thrashed about in a car that is tumbling down a hill at 65 mph, still works like a charm.. her computer is a large part of her life seeing as how she is both a college student and a redditor, and having it work after something like that.. Having something important and familiar around after something as life-changing as a near-death experience such as this one.. I am truly grateful.

To the first responders and nurses and ER doctors who worked tirelessly for 13 hours to give her, myself, her family and friends peace of mind that she was really okay. For learning what you did so that you could help people. To occupy your life with such an altruistic vocation. Thank you. 

To all scientists and engineers who did not directly affect the events that unfolded yesterday, but did so indirectly, through their creations that are implemented into the parts of a vehicle that collapses in such a way that the passengers are, for the most part, unharmed, or that created chips that can withstand extreme vibrational disturbances without mechanically or electrically breaking.. just any sort of science that helps move the human race towards a brighter, safer future for humanity. I thank you.

I love her with all of my heart and without her I am nothing. I want to propose to her. I want to marry her. If I had lost her yesterday, my life would be in shambles right now for her to have come so close to death is too difficult to comprehend for me.. but she was spared, thanks to a bit of luck and quality science. I have never cried tears of thankfulness before yesterday.

If you are a scientist, you may not know it, but your shit could be saving lives.. and I thank you.

1) I think diamonds are nice enough, but not $5000-nice. We looked at many jewellery stores, and the $5000 diamonds didn't bring me any more joy than my $500 simulated diamond.


2) I have moral problems with buying a real diamond.


3) I'm not a jewellery person anyway.


4) Knowing we have money saved for a celebration of 10 years or for an emergency makes me much happier than a diamond.



I haven't told many people (because we're not engaged yet) but they've been so overwhelmingly negative about our decision. They go on and on about how it's a symbol of our love and eternity blah blah, and how I could have gotten a small ""real"" diamond for not much more than $500, or an equivilent diamond for $2000 which is a ""bargain""... and arghhhh!! I don't WANT to spend more on a diamond! Diamonds mean nothing to me! HE means everything to me! 



What people are saying doesn't make regret the ring I picked or love my bf any less (duh) but it IS making me angry and frustrated and disappointed that no-one is sharing our joy.

Like hike around Cincinnati, then hiking to another town and back, starting small. Maybe then try another state. Maybe work my way up to heading to New York, since I've never been there. Having never really hiked before, it seems unwise to just march off without training. I need to train and learn [i]how[/i] to do things that could make it possible someday to go for a looong walk. I plan on training WITH my kids as a summer activity. This thread helped me take a vague desire and focus it into something realistic. Maybe next summer, I can take a long walk with my kids.

My name is Danielle. I used to work for Josh (the Stikkitnow guy). You may also know me as the mother of his child and a multitude of other titles associated with the [baby loading](http://my.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/bh93j/reddit_i_just_printed_this_tshirt_for_my/) post that gained popularity last year. 

I am posting this because I want to address any concern you may have in reference to the lack of professionalism addressed in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ivtie/stikkitnow_com_maker_of_reddit_stickers_has_been/). 

I haven't worked for Josh since March of 2011. Before that the business was running quite smoothly. We did get a bit behind around the holidays--but there were only two of us working here, so I'm sure you understand. After I left, Josh got behind on orders...way behind. I am not sticking up for him in anyway--it IS due to laziness. Despite the fact that I am a full-time student and mother, a lot of the responsibility was put upon me to run this business--and because of my departure, things quickly spiraled out of control. 

What I'm trying to say is that I am offering myself up to answer any questions/concerns you may have, correct any mistakes that have been made, and also ensure that you receive what you have purchased. I am at the Stikkitnow office as I type this and I will stay here as long as it takes to get everything corrected. I am considering sending out (or re-sending...) every order that has been placed since the day I left in March. *I'm going to need some coffee.*

Josh has created a Stikkitnow email for me: **danielle@stikkitnow.com**. Please **FEEL FREE** to message me and I **WILL** respond to you within 24-48 hours. Even if he is going to lose his contract with reddit (which seems inevitable at this point, and is none of my concern) I still want to get each individual order sorted out with as much care and as quickly as possible. I will also include a free decal in every order. 

Reddit is a wonderful community full of thought provoking, witty, and interesting people. I do not want Josh's mistakes to reflect poorly upon myself, nor do I want them to affect you or reddit in any way. Thank you for taking the time to read this. I really hope I can repair some of the damage that has been done.

I'm pretty ignorant and naive. I've been with my new SO for two weeks now, he's the most gentle, well-spoken and loveliest person I've ever met. He's also black. Some people have a problem with that. 

Last night we were walking home from dinner because I like the city at night. Then, a group of four or five men starting following us. They started screaming out racial slurs to my SO. He just made me call a taxi while they got closer and closer, calling him a nigger and saying I need to go with them because my boyfriend would kill me or something. We get in the taxi, and my boyfriend is quiet until we get to his place. He almost didn't seem bothered by it. 

I asked him if that happened often. He said at least once every two weeks. As I said, I'm a young, white lady born into a fairly affluent part of society. I've been harassed in public before, but I never thought anyone could truly hate me to the core and wish death upon me just because of the colour of my skin. Then I thought about how many people would say those things and do more to my boyfriend, who I care about so much, if they could. I pretty much spent the rest of the night crying. Last night I had a brief insight into what it was like to be a minority, and it scared the hell out of me.

It depresses me to think about how every time there's something beautiful and amazing in this world, like my SO, there's so many people out there who would ruin that beauty if they could.

I don't know where it is.  This is the kind of wasp that will probably chase me, sting me into a fetal position, and then sting me some more.  He was big and heavy and loud, and then he fell between my bed and the wall.

Immediately I grabbed a t shirt and twirled it into a wasp swatter.  But he was gone.  I turned off my tv and listened.  I didn't hear anything.  I tried throwing stuff over the side of the bed where I saw him fall.  Nothing.  He can't be dead.  He must be in stealth mode.  Are they that intelligent?  O shit.  I stuffed the side of my bed with sheets and pillows.  I stuffed the area where my feet hang off with the comforter.  

That's right.  I'M SITTING ON THE BED.  I laugh in death's face whenever possible.  And the tv's back on, so I'm pretty much a sitting duck.  AND I'm about to play video games, turning all of my focus away from this fucking WASP that is silently tracking my scent and sound and movement just beneath the bed I'm sitting on.  It has one thing on it's mind.  It is an amoral, uncompromising, hardened killing machine and I am some evil giant who has trapped it in my cruel dungeon with spots that look like they go outside but you can't really fly through them.

So... I'm not sure how to handle this situation.  I'm kind of freaking out and I hear buzzing everywhere, pretty sure it isn't real though.  I'm just hallucinating.  

This is really just something to leave behind if this turns out to be the end.  I will update if I can.  

And HOLY SHIT I just heard him and he sounded like a helicopter.

So I start setting up his google account when 4 of my good friends walk in to the shop and they ask me if I wanted to come party with them. I answer quickly ""No, I can't because I don't have any booze"" because I was busy with this customer, and I'm broke as fuck. Anyway, I'm done with this customer, and he waves goodbye, and I wave goodbye. I thought I was done with this guy and then he comes back with a 0.5 liter bottle of Absolut Vodka, he just leaves it there with a note saying ""Thank you for your kindness, hope this will help your weekend :)"". The fact that this lovely guy gave me 0.5 liters of fun really surprised in a good way, and if you're a redditor kind man, I really appreaciate it. 

TL;DR a random guy bought me a bottle of Absolut Vodka as pay for a task I did for free.

I just had to get this out there.  

Here it goes anyway. I saw a man die today. I was working at my job as a valet this afternoon and some doomed man jumped off our rooftop bar. The sound he made when he hit the pavement was as if a bomb went off. He landed right behind me as I was pulling a car up to tidy our loading zone. I jumped out of the car and in the road was his mangled body, broken in a dozen different places. People where yelling and panicking, I remember some lady screaming that he had jumped. 

Everyone was just staring, I remembered I wanted to yell at my co-workers to dial 911 but everyone was on a cell phone already and I just assumed the ambulance was on the way. I went over and checked his pulse and at first I didn't feel anything but got a single pulse as I held my finger on his carotid. A transit worker asked if I could feel a pulse and I shook my head. As I was telling the worker I couldn't feel anything the jumper took 2 agonal breaths, rolled his eyes back and his eyelids closed. And that was that, it was over. The practical aspects of running a 5 star hotel which essentially shut down took over and I didn't have the time to digest what happened until an hour or so after the fact. I called my brother to tell him I loved him and broke down crying. 

Someones son died today, but he didn't die alone. I was there, I cared. I hope someone is there with me to send me off when I pass on. No one should die alone. This isn't some PSA on how shitty suicide is (although its a pretty damned shitty thing to do).

You could tell that even if the poor girl involved never did another scene in her life she will probably never be able to live down the shame and trauma of what she had just endured.  

I don’t want to see thirty cocks shoved into some poor girls asshole.  I don’t want to see a girl gagging so hard on some guys dick that she throws up and cries.  

Sasha Gray once asked a co-star to punch her in the stomach.  Really?  This is supposed to turn me on?  “Hey honey, let’s role play.  I’ll be Mike Tyson and you be Trevor Birkbeck.”  I’m sorry Sasha,  you’re a very pretty girl but your scenes look like gang rapes.  

I don’t like size D plastic tits on 90 pound girls.  I don’t like seeing a vagina with so many piercings it looks like a fucking Christmas tree.  I don’t like watching a girl have sex who has a spider tattooed across her abdomen.

That is not how I want to have sex.  That is not how I fantasize about sex.  

That’s why I’m going back to vintage.  

There was a simpler time.  A better time.  When the worst thing that could happen to a girl is that she’d have to fuck Ron Jeremy.  And at least he’d be a gentleman about it.  

80’s porn was great because it represented the kind of sex I actually have.  It was fun.  It was simple.  It wasn’t a test of pain endurance and I didn’t feel like an asshole for watching it.    

And the girls looked like girls.  They had real bodies.  Sure they may have had a little more jelly, but I’d rather see a natural body than some sort of plastic monstrosity that looks like it was created on the island of Dr. Moreau.  

Now if you’ll excuse me,  I’ll be watching a woman with a perm and purple eye shadow have sex with a man who has more body  hair than a yak, because God damn it, that’s the way I like it.

I've been bigger ever since I was a small girl -- I recall one time my grandfather weighing me at the age of ten and I was already 150 pounds.

I continued to get older and bigger. All of the extra weight centers around my stomach, big like a fat doughnut. The rest of my limbs look proportional to my body but my stomach... it sticks out and always makes me feel self conscious.

Within the last few months I've gotten an amazing full time job, which means money, which means I can afford going to the gym that is just a few blocks away from my house. I'm even paying extra to have a personal trainer work out with me once a week so I know what to do and what works what.

I started off at 230 pounds, on a 5'8"" frame. Over this last month I've lost about 5 pounds, and there's faults in what I'm doing, which is why it's not going down more -- mostly it's because I don't eat as well as I should thanks to work, and I've been missing the gym some nights. I've been feeling extremely frustrated because the scale isn't going down even though I've been doing so much when I work out.

Two weeks ago, I did notice that I could fit in a size 14W pair of jeans, the first blue jeans I've been able to wear in a while. They were slightly tight, but they fit. Didn't think much of it until I full realized--

I had to wear my work belt with those once tight 14W's yesterday. I had to wear my work belt on the LAST BELT HOLE I HAD LEFT. The 14W's no longer were tight, they were falling off my hips. My uniform work pants no longer stay up without a belt. I was able to pull on a L sized shirt, after wearing XL for years, and not feel like I'm bursting out of it. The resistance on the machines at the gym keep not being enough, so I've been having to make things harder for myself every time I go in. I don't feel like i'm bursting out of my bra now. 

As soon as I realized all that, and more, I started crying in absolute joy. 

It's working. I'm getting fit. The weight isn't dropping because it's shifting around, with the fat being replaced by muscle. My hard work is paying off, slowly but surely. I've a long way to go, but...

I'm starting to feel better in my body for the first time since I was ten.

He was about two weeks from graduating, and while that may seem like the worst time to kill oneself, I think I may know where he was coming from. I didn't know him well, as I said, but I know he was having trouble with his family and that he didn't much care for what he was studying. The world is huge and terrifying, the future a grand unknown, and I think for him, it was too much. 

I wonder if, had I known him better, I could have talked him out of it. I wonder if he wanted someone to. He didn't die a violent death, just a self-imposed one. He died alone, though, but not friendless. I think that's the most tragic part of it.

He is in the Air National Guard and was in Guam when this happened. She was his first kid, my parent's first grandchild, and my first niece. I've watched this girl grow up most of her life, and only recently noticed a change in her.

I talked to her over text last week because she seemed upset. She told me her problems and I listened, told her I loved her and gave her advice. She reached out to my oldest sister two days later. We spoke about it yesterday, how we both noticed she was depressed, and had planned on talking to our brother about it when he got back from Guam the next week. Neither one of us thought she was suicidal. I have a history of depression, and spent my teenage years being suicidal. I thought that I would have known.

My sister in law went to get her up for school Monday morning and found her. She hung herself. This beautiful red headed, blue eyed, porcelain skinned, 12 year old girl. My brother was the last person to find out.

I was up north skiing with my girlfriend this past weekend. One night, a little after dinner, we were lying in bed together, arms around each other, when I got up to use the bathroom, get a snack, or something. The lights were still on since we weren't yet going to sleep, so I could see her well. She was in pajama pants and a big floppy t-shirt. She was kind of curled up with her head turned to me, smiling. She looked so at home.

I was absolutely overcome with emotion. I don't know why. That doesn't happen to me often. There was just a rush of amazing feeling and I wasn't sure exactly what it was. Then I remembered, of all things, [this Reddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/177ooz/my_whole_life_asleep_on_the_couch/). It really did come to me right in that moment.

So much of who I am, what I think about every day, the person who means more to me than anything else, is occupying this tiny space right now. I'd never felt more alone and intimate with her.

At this point I'd been smiling at her an oddly long time and she asked me why. And I told her pretty much exactly what I just said. I was amazed that such a huge part - the biggest part, really - of my life could be contained right here, so close to me but so small in the scope of the world. She was so, so much to me, more than anything or anyone has ever been to me before. I must have been beaming, because I felt so happy and at peace and in awe of how much this one person, this one beautiful, loving, real person, meant to me.

She was curled up in a position where my arm could slip beneath the bend of her knees. With my other hand on her back I pulled her toward me and just held her, feeling her heartbeat and her breath on my neck. We kissed and pulled apart. Really I most wanted to just gaze at her. I felt so suddenly reflective. But even more, appreciative, grateful, and understanding of what love - and my love for her - really meant.

We sat, had beers, had smokes, and chatted about work, school, life, love and loss. I staggered home, content. It was the afternoon, and I cooked myself a rich pasta dish for myself that night to eat alone, as I spoke to my sister on the phone in Queensland.

I woke up this morning, refreshed and empowered. As I watched the Inside Politics morning show on the PBS, I ate a bowl of cereal and began writing an essay I had been thinking about for a long time. I got stoned for the first time in ages, and sat on my own bed, in my own apartment, and thought about all the beautiful things in my life.

I checked my e-mail, facebook, and reddit, and called another friend for an hour or so on the landline, and we talked about doing a project together, and how to go about it with minimal investment and minimal risk, working out an agreement to tackle a problem long in advance.

For mid-afternoon lunch, I sliced a chicken breast and grilled it in hot sauce, cutting a whole-grain roll lengthways and made a homemade aioli, lettuce, pepper, cheese and chicken sandwich, by which point I was no longer high.

Then, I set about planning my week, around work hours, gym sessions, and work commitments. Having done that, I checked the presentations for work and wrote a checklist of possible updates needed in case of a change of plan, and then wrote them up so that I was as prepared as possible.

Then I hit the gym, pounding 75 kg on the bench for the first time. It was a milestone moment, I can tell you that much. So now, I'm drinking a glass of wine and eating salad with tomato, sweet pepper, red onions, rocket and a sprinkling of oil and vinegar.

I don't think there's anyone in the world who is happier than I am. My finances are in order, I have a good job, I am well on my way to owning my own apartment, and I'm young.

A few months ago, I worried myself sick for a week because I thought that my life would never be good. I thought that it was shit wall to wall. I would log into facebook and look at my meagre 30 friends, and think of how sad it was that I was so unpopular. But I don't think that today. I think of how lucky I am to have 30 close friends.

Shes been through more in her 3 months of life then I have yet. Its a long story, but hopefully the end makes your read worthwhile.

I work at a vet clinic, and one day a lady came in with this tiny, sad, poor excuse of a kitten. She wanted us (the vet clinic) to care for the kitten until it was""healthy"" and then she wanted it back. She got the kitten from her parent's farm. She was in a litter of barn cats, and for some reason her mother stopped caring for her, would not let her suckle or be groomed. The lady rescued the kitten from the farm, and wanted her as a pet, but couldn't give her the care she required because she had newborn twins at home. The vet explained to her that we dont operate as a foster home, we cannot care for the kitten long term and that the only option would be to surrender her to the SPCA. The lady flat out refused, saying that she HAD to get the kitten back afterwards. 

This is where I piped in. I very hesitantly, (because i have no pets allowed apartment and hadn't consulted my roomies) offered to care for the kitten, if she paid all the food bills and vet bills. She agreed instantly and said she would cover absolutely anything the kitten needed, she even asked me how much I wanted to be paid per day. Working at a vet hospital, I know how much vet bills for a cat like this can add up, so i told her I did not need to be paid as long as she covered all the expenses. She was absolutely delighted. The lady paid for a feline leukemia test right off the bat, food for a month, and the antibiotics and meds she would need. When I took the kitten out back to be looked at by the vet, the Dr thought I was bringing it back to be euthanized.
     
She could hardly breath out of her stuffed up nose, her eyes could not be seen under her third eyelids, there was discharge from both eyes and nose. She weighed 11 oz, skin and bone, and anemic from the hundreds of fleas squirming on her. There wasnt much we could do for the fleas because she was so young and weak. She was too young for the Revolution flea treatment. I was sent  home with her, a heating pad, and her meds. I took her home and my roommates were ecstatic about the new arrival. She was so weak all she did was sleep. 

After the first night I talked to the vet and she was suprised the kitten survived the night. We kept up with her meds, fed her 6 meals a day and gave her lots of love. Everyday she got stronger, more playful and more AMAZING. We had to take her into the vet a few other times due to some minor complications, but all in all she had a great recovery. She is the most amazing kitten, everyone who meets her falls inlove with her infectious personality. She is still half the size she should be for her age, has upper respiratory problems that will probably never go away. 

Her owner called me regularly for updates, I informed her of her progress and that she will never be the perfectly healthy kitten she may have expected. She told me she was moving into her new home Nov 4th, and would be ready to take her after that. I explained that she had to pay the rest of the vet bill she had accumulated, which amounted to $900 (very expensive kitty). She went in, paid the vet bill and then called me back yesterday. My roommates and I have been dreading this call for so long because we knew it meant she was leaving. Everytime I thought of having to give her up it brought tears to my eyes. Then she called me yesterday she said, ""I paid the vet bills, the cats yours"". I couldnt understand what she was saying, my mind was going a million miles a minute. She explained that she heard through the grape vine that I wanted to keep her, and she decided she would give her to me. I wanted her so bad but never would have dreamed of asking because of all the money she put into her. I never could have afforded her vet bills in a million years being a full time student on a budget. 

This lady paid $900 so I could have the most amazing cat in the world. I thanked her a hundred times, and then told the news to my roommates. To say the least, they were on cloud nine. It is actually the best news I have heard for so long. Ever since we got her, we were dreading giving her up. But now shes ours forever. People can surprise you. There are still great people in this world, and I am forever thankful for it.

I was a lot like that, and never more than when I was going through a rough time period my Sophomore year of high school.

Except it wasn't. The difference between me and the comic that I just described is that unlike the comic, I never faked anything. I let all the dark, depressing and negative emotions, words, and actions flow, and hurt not only me but the people around me. I'm not sure I was ever able to admit that until now.

Time went on into my Junior year and I decided to fake it: fake happiness into my own life by smiling when I saw people I knew, and not have such a shitty attitude to those I have been a jerk to, and those I've not met. I knew I would confuse people because I wasn't acting normal for myself, but being positive to others might create a positive response in themselves. That was the theory, and it seemed reasonable.

Time rolls on and I fake happiness in my social life day in and day out, and it worked well for me: I was getting positive responses from people I knew, my relationships with my friends became more than mere acquaintances, and people were overall more kind to me in response. It's a good feeling knowing people like you, and I can say that they enjoyed my company as well.

Fast forward a while into mid senior year. things get rough on me. First world problems: relationship strain at home, bad grades, best friend of mine gone suicidal over his ex, and other small trivial things put me into another depression state. I decide to stop faking my happiness because I simply felt that I didn't have much of a reason to care about anything.

I was annoyed, frustrated, despondent, and I didn't want to bring any attention to myself. Some friends of mine show up, sit down near me, and talk among themselves and myself about whatever. I'm not doing anything until I'm being talked to by my friend who's brought their attention to me and what do I do? I smile, I sit up, and engage in conversation. That scenario probably happened 5-10 times that day, and the next day, and there on out. I kept doing my best to be a friendly and engaging person up until today and beyond. And you know what? I don't need to put so much effort into faking it anymore, because I'm not faking it at all. This is genuine.

I've learned over time some of the positive effects of being a decent human being, and how my attitude will directly affect the attitude of those I know, and those I meet. I've learned that in acting in a positive demeanor you can and will more often that not, make others and yourself happier as a result. By faking a smile, I've learned to turn it into something genuine.

She has two PhDs and is one of the most intelligent women I know. She said that she flunked out of undergrad twice before she finally could muster up the strength to admit she had a problem and talk to her doctor about changing her medication. I thought you all would like to know that even college professors, with multiple degrees, go through things like this.

This account is obviously a throwaway, my main account is 5+ years old and somewhat well-known*

Not long ago my family was whole. Not perfect mind you, but workable and whole. By mutual decision 10 years ago my wife (then girlfriend) decided that she would work and I would stay home and be Mister Mom. Her job paid more than I could hope to go out and get without years of schooling, and even if I did get a job it wouldn't have even covered the day care cost of a single child. That single child, who we'll call R, was the product of my wife's first marriage. R was an infant when I came along and I am the only dad she's ever known. Our arrangement worked out well or seemingly so over the years, and we had three more children together in that time. I have been mommy and daddy to them all at home their entire lives - I cook, clean, do dishes and laundry, I'm the only one who knows how to sew and mend worth a damn so I do, basically everything an at-home mom does I do. In addition during this whole time I also had the responsibilities of dad, fixing things, building things, etc. I've been plumber, carpenter, window installer and repair expert (people don't know what glazed windows are for some reason), major appliance installer and repair expert, the whole gamut of dad duties in the home and I can say without pride that I'm very good at it.

A bit over a month ago my wife had a major personality shift. She suddenly threw divorce at me, out of the blue. The day before things were just fine. I tried to find out what was going on, she told me at least 6 different stories many of which conflicted with each other. There was crying, pleading, begging for answers, all of that. We got to a point where we were making plans for a physical separation instead, with her moving out since only one of us wanted it and it wasn't me. The next day she ripped the two oldest out of school and took all 4 straight to the courthouse to file an order of protection against me filled with half-truths and outright lies. The court upheld it at the hearing and I can now only see 3 of my children at a special supervised place, and the 4th not at all.

My children are packed in to the back of a tiny trailer house with another family. My children are in a bad situation and enrolled in a new school district that I know for a fact to be garbage (having been in it myself). She doesn't even watch them, she's throwing money at her friend to do it because my wife just doesn't have the parenting skill for it. Nobody will even come near me for legal representation, I have no money having been at-home primary caregiver for a third of my life, what I did have once went toward my kids needs. Legal aid won't even give me the time of day in spite of my situation being exactly what their paperwork says their primary purpose is. My wife is not paying any of the bills or house payments in spite of the court order requiring her to and I'm losing the house. She's likely not paying life or car insurance either anymore.

I have honestly done nothing to make this situation happen. I'm losing everything and my children are in a dangerous place with a dangerous person hell-bent on hurting me for an unknown reason. My kids need me and my wife is trying to paint a false picture of me as some sort of abusive live-in boyfriend.

AMAA, especially if you're in Minnesota and can help me help my kids. I've seen reddit do far more for far less worthy causes and I am desperate.

edit: I'm finding evidence all over the place that she's been planning this for a long time, and planning to set it up to look like she's a helpless victim. I hope I get a good lawyer.

I just need to say it so that maybe it could be of help to someone else

I was walking the usual route to my house from the gym that I take every night. It's a quiet tree passage, it's a pavement, except some genius decided that it would be a great idea to plant trees on the OUTSIDE of the pavement instead of the inside... so everyone walking on that sidewalk would be invisible. It's also not well lit. That made a popular make out point... and as I discovered, mugging

I go to the gym everyday, I workout for an hour. I'm fit, and my build is overweight muscular, I play boxing and jog.
After an exhausting night at the gym, I headed home through my usual passage. When I crossed the street and entered the sidewalk, I noticed three guys just walking normally in my direction, then I passed them (in a normal way, like you pass people on the street)... and it seems that at that moment one of them sparked an idea... I heard some quick whispering, and then one of them turned back walking towards me saying ""excuse me, what time do you have?"" and kept walking keenly towards me. I took a quick glance at my watch (because it becomes something like an instinct) and answered, but also stayed aware that something is fishy. After the quick glance, he grabbed my arm, but as I was already aware of what's going on I broke free and jumped onto the street. He pulled a knife (I didn't notice from where), and made a charge towards me. I jumped further into the street, but a passing car came in front of me and blocked my way to at least cross to other side and he caught me.

I was carrying my phone in my hand, so he took that, I didn't have anything on me except my keys and my sports jacket. So he went off.

It all happened in a matter of seconds. The whole ordeal was over in about half a minute.
It shocked me. I was always training for the case that there is a similar situation. But I got a total mindfreeze and forgot everything... all I could think of, and all that happened automatically was a very foul curse and jumping towards traffic (maybe they'll shy away or someone will help me)

It seemed like the whole thing was done by one person, the other two were like lookouts or just cornering tools, they didn't actually do anything. 

I was very angry. I wasn't afraid (for more than the following minutes)... but I was filled with anger and strong feelings for revenge. The smartphone I turned into worthless piece of plastic as soon as I got home through the anti-theft service, and I can buy another one... then I grabbed my baseball bat and went looking for them! I wasn't thinking straight and I really wanted to bash their heads in. I really did. I changed into old clothes, wore gloves and a cap, I even packed a knife.
But then halfway I thought again, it wasn't the sensible thing to do.

What I discovered is that I'm not ready. I might be in physical terms, but battle is much more than that. I know now that I wasn't ready. For one thing I wasn't aware at all of the other two! They were a few meters away, but I wasn't aware at all of them at the time of the confrontation. My first response wasn't ""bring it on"" like I always thought I would... it was ""fuck you... and run!""

(I called the police after I returned home, and gave a description, but I doubt anything happened)

Well... now I always carry a knife on me when I go out at night. I bought one of those defense keychains with the sharp edges. I'm considering buying a gun, or at least visit the local defense equipment shop to see what options there is (mace, or telescopic baton etc)

**EDIT: please let's not make it a gun debate. I might not be getting a gun after all, I like discreet things more**

**edit2: thanks for all the support and advice from everyone. you're amazing**

Wow!! I went to take a shower and suddenly my unread is jammed and the post jumped to the top of /r/self

Edit: I'm now considering non-lethal weapons. I didn't know that flashlights could be this useful or effective. Seems like there are a lot of discreet defensive equipment, like pens or even your average iPhone case!

**– Here's the concentration of the bellow comments:** maybe it'll help someone else reading this in the future

* A knife is not a good idea. It can be very dangerous, and it's not easy to use and keep hold of

* If you see a mugger, or someone with a knife, seriously for the love of everything, DO NOT CONFRONT... seriously [DON'T!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ah_0gia4A0)

* I never really understood what was Eminem singing about in his old songs until now! He is a wise man

* Getting self-defense lessons could be a good idea, but it's useless if you're not mentally prepared

* A mugger doesn't have a lot of regard to the law or common sense. So don't expect the usual 'rules' between normal people to work with him

* A self-defense flashlight is a very good idea. Effective, but non lethal or illegal

* If you're responsible with a gun, you could get one of the subcompact types. But you need to train a lot, not just how to shoot, but how to control yourself

* Carry a decoy wallet, with expired credit cards and some old expired IDs, with a few small bills (like $1), and put it where people would usually put their wallets

* It really sucks, with the ego and all, but remember that being safe is more important than proving something to someone who doesn't matter (or doesn't even know you or think much of anything)! 

* When someone at night, especially someone who's in the age group that always carries a mobile (i.e. not elderly), asks about the time... he's not asking about the time (all mobiles have the time, 90% of the cars on the street got functional clocks)! The same goes for directions, help, ______ (fill in the blank). Beware and be alert

* Don't walk around with your headphones on or ear-buds in. They block out the environment and you won't hear him sneaking up on you.

Definition of USC 18 921
http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/921

/u/NewThoughtsForANewMe mentioned military response to pressure cookers:




from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction




Under the United States policy of Proportional Response, an attack upon the United States or its Allies would trigger a force-equivalent counter-attack. Since the United States only maintains nuclear Weapons of Mass Destruction, it is the stated policy that the United States will regard all WMD attacks (Biological, Chemical, or Nuclear) as a nuclear attack and **will respond to any WMD attack with a nuclear strike**.[22]





That Being Said, their is a group that claim according to USC 18 2332(a) and 921 4(a) that the weapon in question does fall under the category of destructive device, and from the most anal retentive point of view it is, in fact, a wmd. 





*So, should anything with more than 4 ounces of explosives in it be a Weapon of Mass Destruction? *




Best arguments against this:




""If the Boston Bomb was a WMD, then Saddam had WMD's.""
(by the same logic the planes in 9/11 were WMDs and we should have nuked Afghanistan.)

EDIT: Thanks for the response guys. The idea that someone might actually be able to place a marker on the side of the road for us in Iowa even though we're all in Oregon is something that we never even considered.

Here's a link to the article about the accident: http://www.katu.com/news/local/104519989.html

EDIT 2: I definitely didn't plan on asking for anything, but if there are any redditors in the area (Iowa) where this happened that might be willing to drop a little marker for our friend since we are all back in Oregon and we can't really do anything.

There’s been much discussion, anger, confusion, and conflicting information about CISPA as well as reddit's position on it. Thank you for rising to the front lines, getting the word out, gathering information, and holding our legislators and finally us accountable. That’s the reddit that we’re proud to be a part of, and it’s our responsibility as citizens and a community to identify, rally against, and take action against legislation that impacts our internet freedoms.
We’ve got your back, and we do care deeply about these issues, but *your* voice is the one that matters here. To effectively approach CISPA, the Senate cyber security bills, and anything else that may threaten the internet, we must focus on how the reddit community as a whole can make the most positive impact communicating and advocating against such bills, and how we can help.
Our goal is to figure out how all of us can help protect a free, private, and open internet, now, and in the future. As with the SOPA debate, we have a huge opportunity to make an impact here. Let’s make the most of it.""

But my girlfriend and I were walking by a Starbucks and we were going to be on BART for a little while, so I figured a warm drink was in order. We both ordered black coffee, which came to $2.90.

The coffee was not particularly good.

We BARTed to Moraga, picked up her parents' little Toyota Corolla, and floored it west on 24. We were headed to Palo Alto to visit our friend Steve, who was visiting the Stanford particle accelerator from University of Colorado for the weekend.

We were late. Really, really late.

That's why it wasn't really a surprise when, as we approached the line of cars waiting to pay their toll, I reached into my wallet and produced only two dollars and ten cents. I was frazzled and frustrated and didn't think hard when I spent my last fiver on coffee.

My girlfriend started to destroy the interior of the car in search of change, but twas in vain. Unsurprising for a car usually operated by a sixteen-year-old. And so, under the weight of plans gone wrong, she started inching closer to crying.

I'm not a big fan of conceding defeat, especially to the state. So I rolled down my window and started to make friends. 

""Hey, can I borrow three dollars?""

You were only the second car I asked, Mr. Ram, and you barely allowed me to complete my sentence before you reached for your wallet.

""You can't borrow it, but you can have it!""

You &amp; your bright-red, crew-cabbed, ladders-mounted Dodge Ram swerved toward me - safely! - and handed me three one-dollar bills through my window, then sped away with a *honnnnnnk!*

I was so stunned, so grateful, so *happy* that I got neither your name nor license plate. All I could shout was, ""thank you so much.""

It's not okay to bike at 15 mph through a red light and a pedestrian crosswalk. If you want the rights and respect of an automobile driver, obey the laws of automobiles.

The point of this post is: Don't go looking for jobs in March, because the positions get filled **NOW**


Most companies that I worked for, would post their campus recruitment adds in early september, interview in late sept/early october and send out offers by the end of october.


These would be STEM type jobs, but nearly any summer corporate internship type job likely does the same.  Most of the interviews were behavioral based.  We weren't looking for people who actually KNEW very much - we were looking for people with the right attitude who were progressing through programs which would eventually yield enough knowledge to work with.

Generally, if you're a student, applying for your first office/profession job expect mostly behavioural questsion. Have prepared examples and answers for questions regarding:

- when you've shown initiative
- when you've dealt with conflict
- when you've worked in a team, and your role
- what courses you enjoy/do not enjoy in school
- how you keep yourself organized at work/school
- what helps you unwind, what you do to relax
- what do you want out of a company, what do you see as a good work environment
- what do you know about my company/my industry
- why are you interested in pursuing a carreer

Try not to relate EVERYTHING back to a class project, or a group presentation.  Try to vary your responses over some volunteer work, or a previous job even if it was unrelated to the field.  Don't try and sound like you ONLY go to school.

A ""good"" interview, from my end anyway, is one in which these questions do not actually get asked. A good interview is one where it turns into a conversation with some back and forth, around these topics and the result is that they all get answered. Communication skills are key, so try and not be nervous.

TL:DR **start checking your campus recruitment office's website daily for jobs in your field, not getting an internship will really hurt your chances finding a full time job after you graduate, and lots of people dont know that most jobs, which start next summer, are POSTED VERY SOON**

They held her body in state for one hundred days and then cremated her and buried her at sea in a dissolving urn.

I flew halfway around the world to visit her family and attend the funeral. Because her family and friends had been to visit her body in state during the hundred-day period, they were already well-adjusted to her departure. The final burial had a strangely festive air, as though they were merely seeing somebody off on a trip rather than mourning a final farewell. The only distraught mourner was me, the bereaved foreigner.

I did a search for her full name recently and found only a few records of her online. One of them was a spacecraft mission, which had accepted names from members of the public for engraving on the vessel. Hers was among them, probably submitted by her brother. It's strange to think that her primary monuments are far beneath the ocean and far above the atmosphere.

I still have two shirts she gave me. I have very few pictures of us together - it was my first relationship and I suppose I never really thought much of it ending. Hence the lack of any memorials.

I dated other women after her, and generally stayed on good terms with them as friends and confidantes. But she was the first and remains unreachable and mute. Anything she had to say is in the past.

Life is strange sometimes.


Edit: thank you for the responses - kind, thought-provoking, and shared personal stories. I hope those in sorrow find the path back out to peace and equanimity.

Without me even having to ask, the band of men, carrying shovels and ice scrapers, motioned me to get in and drive, and they would push me out. In less than thirty seconds, I was out on the road, saying my thanks while they were already moving on to the next thing. 

My neighborhood is very diverse. In a city as grotesquely expensive as Washington, D.C. is, it’s a haven of small, moderately priced houses from the 60’s on small lots and a relatively long way from any of the metro lines. It’s a mix of Hispanic, Asian, and Caucasian families, all of us working hard at our jobs, none of us having the socio-economic status DC requires to live in the nice, upper/upper-middle class neighborhoods of the area. I’ve taken to calling it the “middle-class ghetto,” not so much in the common slang sense of the word, but in the sense that the social and economic pressures, which we don’t meet, keep us in the cheaper, older, less desirable parts of the city. 

On my way to work this morning, there were cars abandoned everywhere, even on the major highways. One of my coworkers counted 55 abandoned cars on his trip in. But in my neighborhood? Not a single one. Every car is parked safely, people’s curbs and driveways are clear, and anyone who needs help gets it, from people they don’t even know, almost immediately. I submit to you that it is our diversity, and our common status as second-class citizens, that keep it that way. While the self absorbed, rich people abandon their Mercedes on the highways, we’re a community full of people who help our neighbors, for no other reason than just because they need help.

**TL;DR – A group of Hispanic guys, in a scene reminiscent of an action flick, were roaming the streets with snow shovels helping people dig out and get unstuck. It was awesome and restored a tiny bit of my faith in humanity.**

I haaaaaate unpaid internships with a passion, their very existence is disgusting.  They drive down wages for people who need real jobs in a race to the bottom, because some people are willing to work for free.  They teach people to bullshit away their lives getting coffee and doing unpaid work in exchange for ""skills"" that they should be getting while doing paid work.  

But employers love them because they get poor people and desperate people to work for them for free, and rich people love them as a social sorting mechanism because it gives their kids a huge advantage over the kids who don't have the luxury of working for free.

We should outlaw unpaid internships, but of course that isn't going to happen in a country run for the benefit of the rich, so it stays a buyer's market for labor because there are so many goddamn people willing to work for free.

He also, happily sent me some of these pictures/videos, which i was quick to delete from my computer, but it worried me.

She told me that he keeps on asking her where she lives, but she's scared he's going to come and do something to her. Frankly, so am I.

I don't want to post any of the information on here, as that could be a breach of the rules, but I need some advice.

Living in the UK, I feel helpless. He does this daily, to so many girls, and there is no way for me to even attempt to stop him.

A rare chromosome disorder that causes multiple birth defects, and ultimately, death. We were given the choice to terminate the pregnancy, or wait until the baby died in the womb naturally (in some cases, the baby may survive until birth, but will die within months). I think you all can guess which route we chose.
We have only been married for since September 2011, and weren't exactly planning on having kids yet. The pregnancy was an ""accident"", but we were still overjoyed, and we're ready to be parents.

What happened next I can only describe as a combination of very good luck and divine inspiration. As we entered the store, our evil driver had a cart and had gathered about 3 or 4 items in it. Both of his hands filled with melons that he was about to place in the cart...

I walked quickly up to his cart, grabbed the handle and wheeled it away to the sounds of him saying ""Hey, Hey, that's mine.""

So we go out for some pubs and have a good time. Until the time we hit a nightclub, and i was the only one denied entrance. Reasons unknown. Doorman claimed i was too drunk. 
Luckily i had one of the coworkers number, so i called him. After about three tries, he finally understood what happened and came to talk with me. ""-Get some air, and come back""

Okey. It's not the first time i've been given that advice and made it in at other venues.

So i start to walk around the block and.. wait?
Where was the place again? I was completely lost.
So as i muttered along i asked some guy of the street for a decent pub, he took me waaay off the chart. 
But it was a nice pub, and had nice people hanging out, so i stayed for a while.

An hour later i figured i needed to get myself home, so i called one of the guys who went home early. ""-Sure, i'll wait up. No prob.""
So out i went. It had started to snow even more than the snow that was earlier. And the frosty wind had picked up.

Everything looked the same. First visit in Belfast, and i get lost. Cra.. Ah wait! The gps! perfect. Roaming-shmoaming. I couldn't care if the datacharges went sky high. I was freezing and i was dead sure it wasn't far.

Only thing is that my battery was dead. Since my fancy touchscreen phone had all the gps, wifi, bluetooth and what have you - turned on.

I couldn't even call my friend. 

Starting to get a bit worried. It's now about 3am on saturday morning.
I checked my pockets. Great. No more pounds. Only euros. And i had no money on my visa. 

As i started to ask the cabdrivers for direction it was like tossing a dice. 
""-You're almost there mate, just around the corner.""
""-Have no clue.""
""-It's not far.. About 20 minutes walk back the way you came.""
And the story was the same. No one took me along, since i only had euros.

At one point i even got so desperate that i was thinking of starting to make such nuisence that i atleast could sleep in a cell for the night. But i didn't see a single police officer all night.

As i was walking in yet a direction given to me by a cabdriver, i was halfway up into a housing complex, when i saw an elderly man coming along. It would later turn out that his name was Tommy. I could have called him Saint Tommy for all i know.

I asked him for directions, but even he didn't quite know. But he was willing to take me to the nearest hotel. He looked a bit scruffy, and had a plastic bag with some horrid concoction of a drink. (i barely had a whiff and it could strip paint)

As we got to the hotel, it was fully booked, and the didn't even open the front door.

""-Come on. I'll show you. You can sleep at my place. No bother.""

So as we walk along through the streets, he stops in his tracks and goes: ""-Well. here's home!"" And then he noticed that someone had stolen his blanket. 
""-Ah sh.. Come on! Time for some shoppin' lad!""
And we came to what i can only presume to be a home-less shelter. Because He was apparently well known by the staff. And they were not pleased about him trying to get a bed at 4:30 in the morning. And especially not bringing guests... ;)

So we got ourselves one big blanket each and was sent on our way.
I'm usually quite a freezing guy. And i can get picky with how warm i want my room. But as we sat down and leaned towards the delivery-entrance to this store i just didn't care. Yes the concrete was freezing cold, but to sit down. and have a warm blanket to cover you. I just didn't care.

As i woke up a few hours later, Tommy was a bit buggered over me for stealing the heat from him, but apart from that we were all ok.

""-Time for coffee lad. You seem to need it. I'm buyin'!""
So he bought me a cup of coffee, and wanted a few bucks for a new bottle. I gave it to him.

In general i hardly ever give money to beggars or homeless people just to prevent this. I do give money to organizations regularly.

As he later guided me to the nearest post-office (i still only had euros) the staff looked at us like poisoned rats. But as i picked up my wallet and started to dab with my euro-notes, they shined up. But Tommy stayed outside.

As i was done, and came out he gave me a pair of gloves. 
""-Got some money over.. And i thought we both needed gloves in this weather."" Spot on Tommy. I was freezing solid.

He then guided me to a taxi-rank, where i received the same greeting as in the post office. ""-Got money?"" ""-Oooh.. step inside sir.""

The taxidriver then started to question me why i was hanging out with a guy like Tommy. ""-He's a homeless guy, you know?""

""-Well, he might be, but last night he saved me arse. So that's that.""

I paid the cabbie and got into my hostel. It was basically just around the corner from where i had spent the night. I had a long warm shower, charged my cellphone and checked my wallet. Nothing was gone. 

Sometimes i guess you just have to trust people. Even if they are homeless and don't have fancy phones, or big wallets.

**TL;DR:** I got lost in Belfast and a homeless person helped me.


**Edit** I'm not Irish, and i'm well aware of that i haven't been the most prepared for this thing. I wasn't overly drunk or staggering in any matter. And sadly, i have lost track on Tommy. I'm thinking of trying to get in touch with some shelters up there to see if they can forward some sort of christmas-present from me.",,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,,True,t3_edlf9,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/edlf9/i_spent_this_friday_night_sleeping_on_a_sidewalk/,

Hello everyone,

After all the encouragement and positive feedback my mom received from everyone here at /r/self, she decided to create a book with a compilation of her poetry titled ""Chills and Thrills of Mother Noose"". It's a dark take on the original Tales of Mother Goose. 

She couldn't afford to publish it herself, so she launched an Indiegogo campaign with the help of very talented artists and redditors. If you guys would like to check it out here is the [link](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/chills-and-thrills-of-mother-noose). 

I just wanted to once again thank everyone who boosted her spirits and helped her come from having low hopes to such a high point. She never would have reached this point without all the positive feedback from you. Thanks reddit!

Edit: Well I'm sorry if people took what my mom has done here as some sort of con. It was never my intention to come here to promote my mom's work or anything of the sorts. I just wanted to thank /r/self and update the people one year later on a story I thought they might enjoy. A lot of the things said here were hurtful and rude. My mom is 51 years old and wanting to make people happy with poetry, she's not out to steal 25,000 dollars. Maybe her calculations were wrong, she did her research and that was her conclusion. Wishing my mom would suffocate on all that money, accusing her of conning people, saying people who help fund are gullible and accusing me of making a throwaway just to con people, is unfortunate. I never had any bad intentions, all I wanted to do is update you guys. I'll leave this post up for a while for anyone who cares to see and then I'll remove it. I'm sorry if you guys got upset from my post and for those who gave good advice and support, thank you.

I'm gonna fill you in on one of my particularly painful experiences with Nair products.

Prior to my freshman year in college, I had experimented with [Nair for Men Body Cream](http://images.bizrate.com/resize?sq=500&amp;uid=2239550330) on my butt cheeks/ass pubes with a fair amount of success. I had learned that the most effective and least painful way to manscape my posterior with NFMBC was as follows: turn on the shower, let that shit heat up, hop in, soap up the cheeks (and in between), rinse, soap up, rinse off, step out, towel off (lightly and gently), apply cream to the cheeks and in between (again, lightly and gently), examine your naked body in front of the mirror while allowing the lotion work its magic ~ 8-10 minutes, hop in the shower, rinse off (making sure no cream touches the genitals), soap up, rinse off, shower as normal, towel dry, clothe yourself. The process of showering the ass with hot, soapy water prior to the lotion application was probably the most integral step; the water significantly softened the hairs, thus reducing the total necessary application time for the lotion, consequentially reducing the risk of burning the perianal skin tissue and experiencing the most intense pain and discomfort whenever trying to stand or sleep. I had Naired a few times, and after the first few trial-and-error sequences, this was the formula for pretty much eliminating any chance of burning yourself due to overexposure from the lotion.

Fast forward to my freshman year in college: I had stocked up on the Nair lotion when shopping for school, only this time, I had purchased the [Nair Hair Remover Lotion for Women](http://a1061.g.akamai.net/7/1061/5412/home/www.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/02260022329_450x450_a.jpg). I figured that the formula would essentially be the same, and that the necessary application times would be somewhat similar to those in the NFMBC. And for whatever strange, idiotic reason, I decided not to even glance at the suggested application times on the pink Nair bottle, somehow equating in my head this relationship: 

Nair for Men=super strong formula to remove ungodly body hair of burly man.

Nair for Women=dainty little feminine cream to lift off whimpy little peach fuzz...


**BIGGEST. FUCKING. MISTAKE. EVER.**


Turns out, the Nair for women shit is roughly *twice* as strong as the NFMBC formula, and the recommended application times for the women's version is *4-6 minutes*, as opposed to the men's version, which is 8-10 minutes.

So there I am (in an individual shower in the community bathroom on my floor), about five minutes in to the application process with the WOMEN'S Nair lotion (NOT the weaker, less intense MEN'S product), and so far, everything had gone as per usual as though it had been the NFMBC. Smooth sailing. Then I thought to myself, *""Well, since this pussy shit is in a pink bottle and it's for women, might as well leave this shit on a little longer than normal to make sure I don't have to repeat the whole process again.""* 

*Five minutes later*

**SWEET MOTHER FUCK COCK SHIT ASS BITCH FUCK SHIT FUCK FUCK FUCK**

It crept up on me like a thief in the night. There I was, minding my own business in the shower, about to peek at my phone to see how much time had elapsed, when the skin in and around my ass, ass-cheeks and genitals was lit on fire. Folks, this was the single most intense, painful, horrifyingly painful sensation I had ever experienced. After shrieking in horror, I immediately about-faced the shower head, aimed the water down toward my crotch and-

**SHIT MOTHER FUCK ASS NIGGER CALCULUS MOTHER FUCKING SHIT SHIT FUCK**

Folks, this was when I realized I was going to die. Spraying the water onto the skin to wash the cream off was even more intense than the cream sitting on my skin alone. I continued to shriek in horror. Prior to this moment, I had attempted to restrain my exclamations (looking back on this experience, I was probably in the shower from around 7:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m., and most of the guys on my floor were eating in the cafeteria), but once the water hit, I lost awareness of the outside world, and the inner foul-mouthed-banshee within me surfaced. A few people came in and out of the bathroom during that time, a couple people were immensely curious as to what was going on with the random shrieker in shower four, but people left the scene after I managed to blurt out, ""I'M FINE!"", even though that was the furthest thing from the truth.

It took me about half an hour to muster up what little strength I had left to rinse off the remaining Nair, soap up (the soap application felt like what I would imagine a third-degree burn to feel like), rinse, soap up, rinse, and rinse until I was positive that every last molecule of Nair lotion had been removed from my skin. I turned off the water, and the most excruciatingly sharp pain set in in and around my ass/ass cheeks, and I began to cry softly to myself.

So there I was, naked as the day I was born, ass redder than a baboon's hind parts, flesh as raw as it could be (no bleeding), crying, ready to drink my own piss. Once I finally mustered up the courage to wrap a towel around my waist, the fabric hit my skin, and I knew that I was in for the most painful two weeks of my life. Taking shits and wiping my ass would become a time consuming task of monumental proportions, seeing that I would only be able to wad up the toilet paper and gently dab between my cheeks - wiping was out of the question. And as for sitting down on any surface - I don't want you to imagine the pain I had to endure every time I sat in class. Sleeping? A thing of the past. Even though I typically slept on my side, any time I managed to roll over onto my back without thinking, a sharp pain radiated throughout my body, causing me to lie awake in pain for another half hour before even the mere thought of sleep was a possibility. I recall reading the Nair bottle right after my shower that night. I noticed the difference in recommended application times, and I vowed to myself to never again apply anything to my body without first reading and heeding every warning on the label.

Oh, and I forgot to mention: For this particular application of Nair, I decided to also *give it a shot on my pubes.* 

*The normal pubes.* 

But hey, at least I didn't have to deal with any ass-pubes after that! Trying to wipe when you've got those can be a real bitch...

**TL;DR**: Used the Nair for Men without so much as a hiccup, tried out the women's version and burned tha shit outta my ass and genitals. ALWAYS. READ. AND HEED. LABEL WARNINGS.

EDIT: I was fine after a month or two. The redness went away after a couple weeks of cortizone applications. You can bet your ass off that I read every damn word on that tube.

And I would like to take this opportunity to apologize for using the N-word. I love members of all races, but the expletive may have slipped in there among the other foul words during my moment of searing pain.

And no doubt there will be loads of supposedly informed people who will advise me that I’m wrong. I wish I was. But I’m not. I don’t really know what to say here, a brief history I suppose.

Where to start – well, she drove my father to an early grave. Through relentless emotional abuse, lies and manipulation she drove him to alcohol. She made up fictitious stories claimed, his father, had abused her, just so she could hurt him, claimed that the cliff and forests walks that he used to take us on were horrible and scary and that she hated every minute of them. She claimed he hit her when he didn’t, called the cops on him. Badgered, berated and tormented him till the only escape he had was drink, drink and more drink. In the end the drink killed him.

She got pregnant and claimed that the guy raped her – he hadn’t. She had the baby but has pretty much abandoned him now he is ten and is looked after by us. She won’t let him see his father.

She drove her most recent boyfriend to commit suicide. He was a married man with 5 kids. She seduced him because he was very wealthy. She got pregnant quickly and then again straight after so she could trap him. She manipulated him into putting her name alongside his in the new house that he bought. He realised his mistake and tried to go back to his wife. His wife wouldn’t have him while she had half the new house. He tried everything he could to get her to sign it back to him. I won’t go into too many more details but of course she wouldn’t and in the end he committed suicide. He called her a cockroach before the end.

The list goes on and on, some of it is minor stuff some major but she never changes, never feels guilt or regret or empathy of any kind. Her sole goal in life is to have a compliant slave, a victim that she can torture and abuse and manipulate. Now that her boyfriend is dead and she has his house her latest target seems to be my mother. She tries to make her feel guilty tries to make her feel sympathy tries to get her on her own and cut the rest of us off. When she is on her own she is her pawn.

I believe my mother wants to cut all ties with her but just doesn’t seem able. She tends to fall back on the – ‘but she is my daughter’ line. I don’t really know what to do about it. A small circle of people know what my sister is, but by and large she is able to trick, fool, convince and manipulate people into doing and believing whatever she wants.  She is very, very charming when she wants to be. She has eyes that seem to pierce into your soul – they are like the eyes of a reptile, I can’t hold them for long – an intelligent reptile I think that’s what she is – or as he said – a cockroach.

 I feel like she is invincible. I don’t know what to do.

We hired a mover going down.  I came back up to CT to heal, I am crashing with Family, I only came up with 3 bags, I left EVERYTHING down in Florida.  So its time for me to move out, I drive down with my brother and sister to help me move me out since I am now unemployed and money is tight, this is where the horror begins...

**TL;DR Wife died, got uhaul to move 1600 miles, they over charge me, forget about price match from budget and gave us a death trap of a vehicle**

I had 1 day to go through my wife's belongings and pack myself to move.  Uhaul made this terrible circumstance even worse.  

I originally rented from Budget, I had a truck ready but my brother is in construction and rents a lot of equipment, he said his dealer suggested I try uhaul for a better truck, the one I got from budget had a small cab and I have long legs.  So I called the uhaul place he suggested.  Over the phone I told them what I had already rented from Budget, I went over my costs and I was assured a price match.  They told me the 20' truck is the replacement for what I got.  I went over my entire bill, included in my budget bill was the furniture pads, hand truck, unlimited miles and I paid ahead for 5 extra days.  I told them I wanted a newer truck, I am traveling 1600 miles, I want a new comfortable truck.  The woman assured me I would get the newest truck and the price match was in place, I said are you absolutely sure because I will cancel the budget truck and I need a truck today, again I was assured.  So I cancelled my Budget truck, I had to pay $50 to do so but thought the uhaul experience would be better.   

I get a call an hour later and have been told my truck is ready, I ask about it, the guy said ""which he sounded stoned over the phone"" it was a 26' truck, I told him thats not what I ordered, he said oh we gave you a FREE upgrade!  I told him I wanted the 20' that I was guaranteed, I don't want a truck that big and pay the extra gas for nothing.  I call back and they find me a 20' truck - already wasting precious packing time.  I am told a 20' truck will be available at 4pm, I said as long as it is everything I requested for the quoted price, I was again assured so.  I wait and get a call, a 20' is available.  I go pick it up, the sales guy is ringing me out, I ask to see the truck first, he gives me an attitude, said it doesn't matter because its the only 20' truck he has, and brought up that I declined the 26', I said I still want to see it, we go out, I see the old rusting fleet of 26' trucks and realize why you guys keep on pushing that truck.  I see the 20', my brother said its not the new truck he rented before, the cab is smaller, I told him I can deal with the pain (not enough legroom) I had to get the truck since we had no more time, we are already late in packing, my one day for packing was reduced to several hours.  I said fine, lets take it and get out of here. 

The uHaul guy started ringing me up.  The price was already off by about $100, I was too tired to argue, then he rang me up for the furniture pads and hand truck, I got upset, those were included in the price match.  But I let it pass, I had to go home and pack.  Then after everything is done, he said the truck is due back by the 25th, I said NO, I rented it until the 29th.  I was informed it would be $40 a day extra, I was fuming mad.  This is not the price I was quoted over the phone, this is not my price match from budget, I need you to fix it.  I was already rung up, the guy acted like he was thru with me and I could go, I said no, you need to fix this, he said he had other customers, I said ""I am your customer right now"" do what you need to do to fix this, one and two mistakes I could deal with, but this is too much.  He ""Acted"" like he ""Texted"" corporate and told me so, ""I texted them, I need to wait for them to get back to me"", I later found out this was a lie.  He LEFT the room for a bit, came back on the phone, he said he could not refund me, there could be a problem with my bank not allowing a second charge of that amount through, he said everything was fixed and when I got back to CT everything would be set, I would get my refund and a manager would be calling me in a few hours to go over this.  He ""ACTED"" like he was typing on my account all the notes, I found out this was a lie.  There were NO notes on my account, NO uhaul manager called me later, I was told by the CT dealer when I got back that there was nothing he could do, they don't normally give refunds.  OH WAIT it gets worse!!!!!!  So we are driving up to CT, 1600 miles, we hit a snow storm and the windshield wipers are crap, they need replacing, and the windshield wiper fluid doesn't work.  We stop at a truck stop and get the wipers and fluid, it can't take the fluid, it was full!!!  The fluid dispenser was not working!!!! My brother checked the tube, there is something major wrong with the dispenser.  We buy a bottle of WINDEX!!!!  We are resorted to stopping every so often to clean the windshield!  It was SO dangerous coming home, cause all of a sudden our visibility was reduced to nothing due to the salt on the roads being kicked up, we had to stop on the opposite side of the road at one time and even had to stop on a bridge in New York.  The scariest was in the tunnel, no way to pull over if we couldn't see.  

I finally get back to CT and drop off the truck, I am informed that there is nothing that can be done, I do get a refund for the wiper blades we bought, but nothing can be done about the price match, that had to be done at the time of pick up.  I was able to get the extra days knocked off, so I had to wait for that to be fixed, so another wait while the drop off place called corporate to see what could be done.  I am so disappointed with Uhaul, this is the worst experience with a company I have ever had. 

**EDIT/UPDATE** Thank you all for your responses, I will am trying to respond to everyone, I am sorry so many of you had similar problems with UHaul.  I posted a complaint and a link to this thread on their facebook and twitter, I just heard back via Facebook.  Looks like I am making progress, no resolution, but a voice at least.  

**U-Haul Leo, we're sorry for your loss of your wife and for this terrible experience you've had with us. We'd like a chance to review all the facts and details to better assist you. If you're able to, please provide us your reservation number to uhaul_cares@uhaul.com and our team will gladly help. Please also include the best contact number to reach you and a member of our team will contact you directly. We apologize once again and look forward to helping make it right.**

I emailed them right away, lets see what happens, thank you again for everyones insights and comments.

**Update #2**  I got a call from an Allison from UHaul, they are reviewing my post on Reddit, Facebook and Twitter.  They have my info, she asked if there is any more info, I said read the reddit post, that has about everything.  She assured me I will hear back from uHaul in 24-48 hours after they review everything and I have her direct line to call back.  So no resolution yet, but contact is good.

**EDIT**  I created a youtube video to spread the word, so now I hit them on FB / Twitter / YT and Reddit - here is the link if you want to check it out and give it some views  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0ODJbZn62k

**Edit**. Thank you all for all your comments and support.  I lost power last night with the high winds, I am trying to respond to everyone's comment, you all rock.  Thank you again.  As it stands now, I am waiting for uhaul to call me back.  I am heading out to charge my phone, hopefully I will hear from them today,  I will surely keep you all updated.  Also, sorry for the low audio on the video below, I'll try to speak into the mic on the update video :)

**UPDATE AND RESOLUTION**  I can not thank you all enough, I don't think I would of received any resolution without the combined voices of Reddit!  I received a call yesterday, I would of updated sooner but I was still out of power.  John from the regional office in Ft.

After realizing I'd really been in love with an idealization of that person, I finally feel like I can move forward with my life.",PetePeters,621,177,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/16hnug/i_was_a_wreck_over_a_girl_for_2_years_after/,"A little over 2 years ago I worked with a girl, fell for her, and then found out she liked me too. But nothing became of it because she moved across the country shortly-thereafter. I was devastated.

We basically stopped communicating a few weeks after she moved. She was busy with her own life and I didn't want to pathetically try to grasp onto something which clearly wasn't going to work given the circumstances. I would've liked to have kept *some* contact, but we just lost touch.

Well 2 years later I was still convinced we were ""soul mates"" and that I would never meet anyone I clicked with as well as her. I was still having dreams about her. I felt like I couldn't even be open to dating any other girl because she would never measure up to my ""dream girl"". Every new girl I met would undergo the comparison test and almost immediately fail. I knew this wasn't right but I didn't know what  to do to move on. I basically just lay dormant and hoped for the best. I thought that time was all it would take for me to heal. I had heard this said over and over again, and as helpful as letting time pass can be, it wasn't the full remedy for me. I had to change something about the way I was thinking.

I realized this about three months ago when I read about how people sometimes have idealized fantasy versions of other people in their heads. I had known about this and had even thought before that I was probably doing it to some degree with this girl, but it wasn't until that point that I really started considering the severity with which I was doing it. When I examined the facts and really mulled it over for a few days, it became pretty hard to deny that I had been seriously guilty of this. When I finally realized this and actually accepted and absorbed it, I felt like I could move forward for the first time in two years. I felt free. I can't express how liberating this revelation was for me.

I have no idea if we would've been a good match in a relationship. It never got that far. That doesn't mean we couldn't possibly have been a good match, either. Sure that's a possibility. But the important point is that that is nothing but speculation. Before this revelation I *knew* that we would have been. No ifs, ands, or buts. I just knew it. It's quite a humbling experience to look back on how sure I was of something for two years that I now know was almost entirely complete bull shit. It makes me question other things that I'm still so ""sure"" of about the world, and how closely my vision of the world aligns with the actual world.

I feel like I've just awoken from a two-year coma. This is not to say that none of the heartache or feelings I felt were based in reality, of course some of them were. But I am confident now that the extreme lingering and unnecessary suffering I experienced for two years was mostly due to my delusional view of who she was. 

I wanted to share this because I really hope someone else who is in the same type of situation I was will read it and possibly have a light turn on in their head as well. I wish I had considered this idea seriously a lot sooner. Because I'm finally excited about meeting new people and forming new relationships again.

My love came back to me. Sure, her mannerisms aren’t the same, her hair’s a different colour and I call her by a different name. But it’s back. 

We take the same walks through country paths in the rain and the sun. I tell her those same stories of my past and future, and she nods and laughs – just like the first time. But it’s not the first time. 

My first time is gone. My lies and my coldness saw to that. Though I loved her, I would tell her to leave. I’d withdraw and I’d hide the warmth from her. I loved to see how she pined for my heat once locked outside in the numbing night air. 

But one day, the scrabbling at my door stopped dead, and when I peered so reservedly from behind my drawn drapes, I saw nothing; I felt nothing. Then grieving. 

I would sit up late, and early, thinking about what I’d done. I would scream and shout until I went red, hoping that she’d hear and maybe feel something for me to see. But she never did. 

My love is back now though. And every now and then, I see a glimpse of my first in her. It reminds me of how I will see, so vividly, the colour orange whilst chomping upon a Terry’s chocolate treat; a sort of homage to that sad citrus fruit with whom I experienced it first. 

**So, my message to all of you is this: do not become hung up on ‘the one’. Chase the feeling. There exists the potential in a billion souls. Do not be afraid to ignite that fire once again. Let it engulf your world. Let it envelope your senses. And when that last flickering flame turns on itself in anguish, don’t ever let yourself believe it’s been forever extinguished.**

She had severe OCD and would scrub me with steel wool or scouring pads for hours on end, or leaving me crying in my crib for hours at a time. My dad was attending seminary and was rarely home, or was busy studying when he was home. When I was two my mom finally got ‘help’ from a Christian clinic in Dallas (I am not sure they actually helped her, just diverted her psychosis). My dad was an evangelical pastor and right-wing politician who spoke of nothing but how evil the world was, and my parents went to incredible lengths to shelter me. I was not allowed to own, watch, listen to or discuss anything that was not explicitly Christian. They had an ultra-right-wing radio station playing at all times. We lived in a very small, very religious town. I was sent to the local Christian school, where I was bullied endlessly because I was small and poor. The one time I tried to stand up for myself, I was nearly expelled, beaten with a paddle by my parents, and grounded for a month. By the seventh grade I had attempted suicide by overdose three times. Finally my parents started homeschooling me through a (Catholic) internet school. It was through that simple phone line that I finally broke out of their bubble. It didn’t take long for me to find out that it was perfectly normal to not believe in god. This resulted in a near-disowning by my family. My parents affected the same solemn manner one might take on when a loved one has just died whenever I was around. Even though I excelled in both academics and sports, I was never encouraged in anything, and anything less than perfection was attributed to my lack of faith. I was dragged in front of the church congregation, thrown into the baptismal tank and forced to renounce the devil. I thought I was going to be drowned. Church deacons came to the house and attempted several exorcisms. When I finally went back to the private Christian school, I had adopted a gothic style and a pagan belief system as well as obtained a black belt in karate. To this effect I was hauled in front of the principal almost every day for something related to my ‘cursing’ someone, ‘plotting’ to shoot everyone in school, or ‘threatening’ another student. (None of it was ever true.) I moved to the city immediately after graduation. I found myself suddenly on my own in the world, with zero self esteem, no money, no parental help, no direction in life, and no marketable skills. (My one consolation in life was an understanding girlfriend who probably saved my life. Even though we parted ways and she’s married now, we keep in touch.)

It’s eight years later. I’ve undergone several years of therapy, took some medications to even out the worst of the chemical imbalances, and discovered a wonderfully therapeutic herb. (I will not hesitate to say that smoking up has done more for me than any therapy or medication. The fact that a single person has ever spent even one day in jail, or suffered needlessly because of archaic drug laws regarding pot, should be a source of national shame.) I have had a stable career for several years, I’m in the best shape of my life, I am part of a terrific boxing team with encouraging coaches, friends that are always there for me when I need them, and I am making a name for myself as a photographer. I have finally managed to steer my parents to a more centrist viewpoint, and my siblings are thriving for it.

Of course, I’m not without my problems. I’m extremely high-strung and take everything much too seriously. I still feel very awkward socially and need a lot of time to myself. I still struggle with severe depression. It is still very difficult for me to connect with people at an emotional level. I often don’t understand why something I’ve said or done is hurtful. And I’m not sure that I will ever get over some of these issues. Sometimes I wonder if I am simply “broken beyond repair” in a way, that the traumas I suffered during my most crucial developmental phases can never be overcome.

But I’m going to keep on going. I’ll be honest, death will be a sweet release for me. In some weird, morbid way I look forward to finally resting forever. But I have no intention of ever bringing it about by my own hand. I believe that the best revenge I can take against all the people that ever hurt me is to live my life to the fullest. If you’re reading this, and you feel lost or hopeless, just keep holding on. Keep doing your best. Life can change in the most beautiful, unexpected ways.

I am a skinny guy, but I'm a moderately strong swimmer. This morning, I decided to procrastinate a bit. In lieu of getting a head-start on projects that need to be completed for Monday, I decided to kayak out to a nearby beach and spend an hour or so snorkeling and diving with the fishes. I grabbed my mask and snorkel as well as some water and headed for the beach in the 11:00 AM white heat of the sun with my kayak balanced on my head.

Forty-five minutes later, I was rounding the bend to one of the best local snorkeling spots, riding the abnormally strong chop and surge with awkward, swashy movements while balancing precariously on my simple little craft. There were some twenty people on the small beach, an abnormally large crowd. As I drifted towards the beach I passed two young highschool-football-sized guys splashing around in the waist high waves.

I beached my kayak, grabbed my mask and snorkel, then turned around and started wading out into the water. I was only about twenty-five feet from the two guys I had passed when I got beyond walking depth and began to swim. Then one of the guys looked at me and said ""Ayuda!"", which is help in Spanish.

My Spanish is terrible, and I'm an incredible skeptic. I just looked at the guy until he repeated himself a little louder.

""Ayuda!"" He and his buddy seemed to be heading out farther to sea.

""En serio?"", (Seriously?) I asked, ""No puede nadar?"" (You can't swim?)

He must have detected my terrible Spanish, my skepticism, or both, so he switched to panicked English.

""Help! I no swim!""

That's when he slipped under water taking an audible mouthful of water with him. He came back up for a second, then went right back under. His friend, for the first time above conversational level, yelled ""Help!"" I still kind of thought they were joking. The first guy, though, who was closer to me, was spending a lot of time under.

With my mask and snorkel still in hand, I swam over towards him. We were only about twenty yards beyond standing depth. The depth and current were shifting rapidly - it was a pretty surgy morning as I mentioned.

As soon as I was near the guy who was worse off, he latched onto me like a cat in a house fire. I realized that I had no idea how to save someone from drowning as I took my first unexpected mouthful of seawater. I arranged the guys arms around my waist and used my arms in a breast stroke to begin moving toward shore. He kept dragging me under. I was incredibly surprised at how difficult it was to stay above water with this guy on my back, and knew instinctively I couldn't help both guys at once.

They were both still shouting ""Help!"" over and over, but no-one from the beach was coming. In defense of the beach goers, I totally thought the guys were just kidding around at first, too.

I dropped my mask &amp; snorkel, and started to panic realizing the second guy might be in serious trouble. I shouted ""Help!"" once or twice while swimming, but couldn't spare the air and stay above water at the same time. Struggling fervently like that in front of all of those people looking on casually was, oddly enough, really embarrassing.

I must have said something along the lines of ""I need to help your friend,"" to the guy who had me around the waist, because he said suddenly ""My friend swim, but no good."" He then continued to shout ""Help!"" and ""Ayuda!"" alternately until finally some guy on the beach stood up and began walking towards us - slowly.

At this point we're just twenty or so yards away from the beach, but the tide's high so it's still kind of deep. The guy from the beach is convinced that it's for real by now, so he starts swimming out and grabs the guy behind me.

The guy who's attached to me says ""We can stand,"" and stands up - the water is about chest high. Then he says ""Thanks.""

He stood on the beach for a second throwing up some water.

The other guy - and the one helping him - make it to the beach a moment later. The two near drowning guys stand around a little bit dazed for a moment, then go back to their towels and start putting on more sunscreen - laughing and joking like nothing happened.

A lot of people were staring at me from the beach. There were a few pretty girls but their mildly startled, awkward stares had more of an ""inconvenienced"" feel than a ""having erotic fantasies about you"" feel. I felt awkward.

I looked for my mask and snorkel in vain for some fifteen minutes. I felt really ridiculous, because it felt like people were still kind of watching me. It seemed like my sunscreen got rubbed off in the struggle, and I'd lost my gear. I realized I hadn't brought my bottle of sunscreen, too. Looking around, I thought for a second that maybe I could ask someone to borrow some, but I felt a little too embarrassed to.

I still had to kayak back home - forty-five minutes in which I would certainly burn to a crisp.

1374057926.0,432,self.self,1ih884,Today I was shouted at by a paramedic for calling an ambulance after being hit by a car. Did I do the right thing?,banginchoonz,587,155,198,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1ih884/today_i_was_shouted_at_by_a_paramedic_for_calling/,"At first glance, the answer may be obvious, but here's some context.

I was cycling from the local train station to my office, when a car hit me and pushed me off the road. I was thrown off my bike, and landed pretty badly by the side of the road. Not knowing where the nearest hospital was, and unable to contact any of my family - who live 40 miles away, - I called an ambulance.

I was bleeding heavily from my arm, side, knees, shoulder and hands; my knees were excruciatingly painful, and I thought I'd broken a rib. Moreover, I couldn't walk. It took all my energy to move myself and my bike off the road to the sidewalk.

The important part: When the ambulance arrived, the paramedic looked at me and said 'it's very inappropriate to call an ambulance for this kind of thing.' When they escorted/carried me into the back of the ambulance, he carried on; 'I mean, what possessed you to call 999 [UK]? Why on earth would you think this is a job for paramedics?' I was pretty shocked; I couldn't walk, I was on the verge of passing out, covered in blood and in a lot of pain.

After cleaning my injuries, and checking for broken bones, he really laid into me saying that I was 'way out of line' and so on. I genuinely didn't know what to say, other than to dully apologise.

It eventually transpired that I was alright; no broken bones, just sprains, scrapes and bruising. I keep thinking in hindsight that I shouldn't have called an ambulance, but then I remember that I couldn't walk at all, and was bleeding a lot.

What should I have done instead? Did I do the right thing?

**TLDR: Got shouted at by a paramedic for an 'inappropriate' callout after being thrown off my bike; bleeding heavily and unable to walk. Did I do the right thing in calling?**

-

Edit: Thanks for the support, guys. I will be submitting a formal complaint at some point regarding how I was dealt with. I'm in a fair bit of pain, but that doesn't bother me half as much as the shitty experience I had with the paramedic, if I'm honest. Nonetheless, I'm grateful that they cleaned and dressed the injuries and so on, and even more grateful that it didn't cost me a penny, thanks to the NHS.

I was able to get in contact with my dad, who came and picked me up where the ambulance left me.

**Edit 2**: I have submitted a complaint to the regional ambulance trust. I don't expect to hear back, but it's worth a go. Thanks again!

**Edit 3**: For anyone who's still interested in this, I got a call from the regional ambulance service today, saying that they took this kind of report very seriously, and were conducting a full investigation into this guy's conduct.

I feel like a bitch for complaining, but after the overwhelming response to this post, not to mention my GP's surprised reaction when I told him - during a consult for a different issue - I decided I ought to.

My name is VagrantWolf. (I don't like using my name in public forums.) I will say that I am a Michigan Army National Guard Soldier. I have been in for quite a few years. Outside of the guard, I am a warehouse worker and going to be a student here in the winter 2012 Semester (Jan '13-May '13). I pay my bills and whatnot, but honestly at this point in my life I don't have much spending money or money to put away in savings. I don't mind, because I still get by, whereas others are not so fortunate.


Recently, I suffered a pretty brutal injury to the hand. I had a knife pretty much filet my finger/hand, and severed the tendon 100% ***(for those interested, I have included an album of picture of everything. Be warned, they are quite graphic.)***. When I went to the ER they told me I would need to have to have surgery to repair the damage. I was not at work when it happened, so worker's compensation wasn't an option for covering it. Past that, I do not have health insurance. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't going to be able to pay outright either, having no savings. I wanted to setup a payment plan, but the surgery center wanted at a minimum of half of the bill up front ($1950, $3900 was the total). This had me pretty down, because they made it sound like I wasn't going to be able to have my hand repaired, which meant the end of my military career. This was yesterday.


Today, I arrived for my appointment at the surgery center at 11:30 am. Upon arrival, I filled out the paperwork, spoke briefly about the billing and not having the money to pay up front. After sitting for a few minutes, one of the nurses approached me informing me that my appointment wasn't until 12:45, and that the doctor was running about 25 minutes late past that. My parents and I left to get some food (for them) and would return later.


Upon returning, checking in, and sitting down, the same nurse came back, saying he needed to speak with me about billing, and asked me to come with him. I did so, and when we reached the office he sat me down. I was incredibly depressed, thinking he was going to tell me the doctor couldn't do the surgery because I couldn't pay. After asking me a few questions about my employment, my military career, and my plans for the future (School), he informed me that while I was gone getting food with my family, an anonymous donor had footed the entire bill for my surgery, knowing I was a veteran whom is just scraping by financially. I was overwhelmed. I still am, in fact. I have had meals bought for me when I am in uniform, I have had my gas bought for me while in uniform, and receive discounts at various restaurants. Never before though has someone been so generous to me just for serving my country. 


I don't know if this person is a Redditor, in fact I doubt it, however, if they are, I would like to express the utmost gratitude for what you did today. My military career is saved because of your generosity. I really can't put into words past that my feelings for the generous donation you made to my cause. I get the feeling that you are someone that I know because it wasn't known at the time at the doctor's office that I was a veteran. If you don't know me that makes it all the more amazing. I serve my country willingly, not really thinking of people being gracious of my service and just doing it out of a want to do it. I do it because I love it. This random act of kindness made me realize that there are people out there that really do appreciate the time I put in for their freedoms.


Thank you random person that I don't know. I will pass this on to someone in the future that needs it just as much. 

Here is the album of the pictures of my wound, to include one of myself with my cast post operation.***BEWARE: GRAPHIC IMAGES (GORE)***

Makes me a little less depressed about the trolls. :D Your messages and kind words and stories you've shared have been so uplifting. I wish I could respond to all, and I will definitely try. And from the looks of things now that I'm off to hang out with my dog (I've been getting whines for attention for an hour), it seems the backlash has been unleashed. So...thanks a million. Can't say it enough. 

**Original Post:**
Long time lurker on Reddit here; finally made account. Anyway, I was digging through some old files from a blog I abandoned long ago and found this, which I thought (some) Redditors might enjoy. Wrote it not too long after I split from my ex-husband. All 100% true. He was charming before we married. Not at all a douche. Sweet, happy, little nerdy, lovely human really. After: Satan. No, there was no sign of what was to come, so read on only if you can suspend disbelief.

*  Stop wearing your wedding ring 4 weeks after returning from the honeymoon. Tell her you’ve decided it just doesn’t fit with your image.

*  Eyeball her ass and suggest we should reconsider eating burgers for dinner.

*  Scowl, accuse her of nagging you when she asks why you keep staying out till 3 a.m. On weekdays. Advise her it’s “conversations like this” that will make you leave her.

*  Tell your wife that you’ll be nicer to her if she would keep all bathroom products, including shampoo and soap, in the linen closet, removing them only for the purposes of bathing and returning them immediately thereafter. Become angry when your wife sincerely asks if you are joking.

*  Make no moves on your wife except when she’s sleeping. Accuse her of rejecting you when she doesn’t wake up. (Wife must be a deep sleeper for this one to work).

*  Leave her two weeks before her bar exam because she’s not spending enough time with you. Make sure she knows that you are extremely hurt by her lack of attention and that you find it unacceptable.

*  Deliberately mow down the garden she spent all spring planting.

*  Watch porn every night. Express your irritation when she asks you to maybe cut it back somewhat.

*  Move into the guest bedroom without explanation. Thereafter, express your annoyance that you’re not getting laid.

*  Start going to the gym. Soon increase your visits to twice a day. Drink heavy volumes of protein shakes, flex in every mirror, and repeatedly remind your wife and her friends about how “fucking sexy” you are.

*  Facilitate a co-dependent relationship with your domineering mother. When in conflict, put your mother’s wishes before your wife’s. Blame your wife for putting you in such a position. Refer to mother as “sweetheart.” Share unsolicited stories about your mother’s “cuteness” in social settings.

*  Frequently voice your opinion that your wife is a slob. Point to a pair of shoes near her closet door and a newspaper on the dining room table as unequivocal proof. Tell her you just can't take it anymore.

*  If your wife asks for a Hilti hammer drill for her birthday, earnestly ask her if she’s a lesbian. Explain that you’d rather be married someone who’d want a Louis Vuitton handbag, despite having spent your dating years ridiculing women who carry them. Later, loudly refer to your wife as “high-maintenance” to your brother; don’t elaborate, just shake your head.

*  Accuse your wife of feigning illness to avoid sex. Express your suspicion that your wife’s fever and prescription for antibiotics was obtained under false pretenses in an effort to cover up her elaborate scheme.

*  When your wife suffers a full-body 2nd degree sunburn on a subtropical island, tell her she's ruined your vacation. Refuse to call a doctor when her body temperature reaches 104 degrees and she begins suffering from severe edema. Tell her she's a drama queen if she complains of the pain of the open blisters that littered her back. Repeatedly remind her to ""suck it up.""

*  When with the dogs in the yard, lead them to your wife's vegetable garden to do their business. Feign ignorance when her tomatoes die.

*  Ogle other women openly. Frequently remind your wife how often you are hit on by models. Accuse your wife of jealousy when she reminds you that you are married to a model. (in the younger days, but irrelevant)

*  Make plans with your wife to have dinner at home on a Friday night. When your wife arrives home with the food that evening, advise her that you're irritable with her so you're going out with your friends instead. Express your annoyance when your wife asked what she did; leave when she gets teary. When you come home the next day, fail to notice she cleaned the toilet with your toothbrush.

*  Tell your wife her occasional smoking habit is gross. Smoke full packs of cigarettes when you're drunk.

*  Tell your wife you want her to throw you a ""surprise"" 30th birthday party. When your wife spends thousands of dollars and countless hours pulling off the party of the decade, be sure to thank your mother for it. Do not under any circumstances thank your wife. Heckle the entertainment. Boo them.

*  Apply self-tanner twice per day until you’ve spent at least one continuous year in a Tropicana shade of orange. Listen intently when your physician tells you some tint might be irreversible, and later, after considering the issue, determine that this is a desirable outcome.

*  Talk, don't listen. Jump to batshit crazy conclusions. Facilitate conversations like these:

Wife: ""Hey, I need the keys to your car. It's pouring out, we need sugar and my gas tank is empty. I don't want to walk in the rain cause it sucks.""

Husband: ""[angering] I'm concerned that you'd say that and I think you need professional help.""

Wife: ""Say what? Huh?""

Husband: ""I'm going to key your car and pour sugar in your gas tank cause you suck.""

Wife: ""??????""

Husband: ""This is why I can't stand you.""

Wife: [sigh]

*  When confronted in the driveway about your many affairs your wife just discovered, admit them but emphasize that they are your wife's fault. Calmly explain that if your wife had been nicer to you and laid you more often, then you wouldn't have had to get your needs met elsewhere. Accuse your wife of proving her cruelty when she responds by screaming that you are a ""self-absorbed mentally ill heartless sociopathic motherfucker who didn't deserve to share in one second of my life. The fact that you lowlife douchebag ever touched me makes me want to vomit! The WAR is ON now you piece of shit jerk. Don't piss me off any more unless you want me to make this UGLY. GOT IT?

**EDIT:** I should note a couple of things after seeing all the comments. 

(1) **Behavior Before Marriage.** While we dated he was not, I repeat WAS NOT, remotely like the person he became. There were zero signs. I, my family, friends, even HIS friends: everyone were completely blindsided by the 180. He was a laid back software developer for chrissakes. At least when I married him. Could you look back and say, ""Hmmm, X was a sign?"" Maybe. Just as much as you can look at a serial killer and say, ""He threw crabs into a boiling pot of water! We should have known!"" Everyone who knows me &amp; him would probably agree there really weren't any signs that anyone but a psychic could discern. A couple of shrinks have since diagnosed him as a clinical sociopath (among other problems) and believe that he was unusually skilled at hiding his true self. Me: ""Obviously."" Him: ""Yeah, I was."" In other words: he agrees.

(2) **About Me.** I'm a good person, overly kind to even jerks, have a pretty strong adventure streak, and  pretty happy. I'm not, contrary to some, ahem, suggestions, a douche myself. Being self-aware enough to know you're attractive, intelligent, or possess any reasonably good quality does not make you a douche. Confidence doesn't make you a douche. But believing and behaving as if that quality makes you special or entitled to better treatment: that makes you a douche. See the difference? I don't think I'm special. But that doesn't mean I don't know where I score on the beauty scale. :-/ 

(3) **Sorry, I'm Not Crazy.** He admits now that I did nothing to deserve the horrendous treatment. In other words, there wasn't some asshole or psychotic behavior on my part that I conveniently left out. Yes, I do agree there maybe were things I could have done differently that may have helped minimize his behavior, that maybe I could have listened better or been more attentive at times or any number things. But he would tell you it wouldn't have made a difference in the end. He admits now he would have done pretty much anything to destroy the marriage. He was (and probably still is) a diagnosed psychopath, end of story. I could have been June fucking Cleaver and he would have hated me anyway. No, I'm certainly not perfect. Far from it. But I didn't deserve even a fraction of what he did to me. 

(4) **But Ok So I'm the Douche?** 

And sure, you can consider me a attention-whore, a conceited/egotistical [insert insult here] by the mere identification of myself as attractive, intelligent, cool, and (OH MY FUCKING GOD) suggestions in the post that perhaps I live an otherwise pretty charmed life. As long as you have the simultaneous understanding that the existence of those traits is precisely what makes his behavior all the more psychotic. If I turned into an unattractive dumb bitch (pardon the phrase, but it is after all the opposite), then *maybe* you could excuse *some* of it. Maybe. Like the porn consumption. Or trying to get laid in the pitch black. I mean, let's get real, I won't fault a guy for beating off in front of the computer if his spouse clocks in at a quarter ton, is a meanie, and grew horns and a beard. But I'm not those things. THAT'S what makes his shit so much more nuts.

People who did heroin must be either really bad or a good ad. When they found my blue-faced uncle on his bathroom floor when I was eight I figured he just had this shadow living inside of him and since I didn't feel the shadow inside of me that I would be alright. My family was poor, just me, my mom, and my brother. That same year that my uncle died is the same year that my mom decided to tell me she was molested by my great grandfather who I don't even remember meeting. I remember that's when I started to see the shadows. My dad was bribed out of the family by the time I could walk and all I know is that was for the best because I was told he came at me with a screw driver while I was still part of my moms guts. So I knew I didn't have it like most other kids. So when my mom gradually turned her eye from barely-on-the-family to  staying at work until bedtime even after she wasn't getting paid I figured that was great because I got to come home and eat pudding for dinner and I could add sprinkles and powdered sugar and nobody would say anything. And then when my brother started getting old enough to hang out with kids who suped up their cars to throw up all over our living room for the next four years and pin me by my neck to the hallway wall I stopped trying to figure things. I was smart, my teachers told me I was smart, and I was about to go to college. Life comes in phases, I was told, and the world was my oyster. I never made any close friends growing up, I didn't know how, and desperate people aren't attractive to anybody. So I smoked my way through a liberal arts degree and when I got to the other side all I had was a piece of paper. So I looked around and I moved away. 2000 miles away. I didn't know anybody so I had to be sober. Which was true, so I started drinking instead of smoking. And then I roomed with somebody who turned out to be a dealer. So now I was drinking and smoking. And now I can't feel that eight year old on my face anymore. I'm only 26 and my face feels saggy. And the alcohol doesn't do the trick anymore. And pot is a guaranteed anxiety attack.

I'm still in shock. It -literally- does not seem real. Infact, I'm questioning my own sanity as if this is all a dream or something.

He had surgery on his hand on Tuesday and was kept overnight because of unexpected, extreme pain he was experiencing. They sent him home Wednesday after not being able to find anything wrong in the tests. He started to complain that he was not able to go to the bathroom and that he was in extreme pain. He had some type of surgery to fix a condition he had his whole life in which his hands would sweat a lot. They had to puncture his lung to get to a nerve they had to operate on in order to fix his hands. Considering he was a life long smoker, this makes no sense to me but like I said, all tests came back OK - it was said to have just been super painful.

My friends dad, who was spending the night to take care of him, woke up at 4am for work and found him in the bathroom on the floor. He was already dead, but he gave him CPR for an hour.

They are doing an autopsy to find out what happened. We think it is most likely a blood clot of some sort, or possible renal failure.

Just looking for some kind words to help pull me thru. I've been having a lot of psych problems myself lately and was finally starting to get better - until this happened. Now I feel like everything shattered.

He was a great guy. He owned/operated a half way house for struggling addicts, as a life long addict himself. He helped everyone he could, and always gave great advice. He loved me and my sister to death and would do anything for us. This has shattered my world

I would say so too because I have nothing against it and will support my opinion with the equal rights BS. 

But when questions about homosexuality is asked as a self-evaluation like you're actually asking yourself whether you support gay marriage, or whether you would say ""go on and be gay"" to your child when he/she comes out of the closet, your answer may or may not change.

I have a feeling, and that's just my opinion, that there is an abundance of liberals out there who are just echoing what the norm by uttering statements like: Woohoo go on and be gay, this is your right, I would totally support my child if he/she is gay, etc.

I'm going to come clean to the Reddit community. It's difficult for me to accept homosexuality. If my son is gay, I would have a hard time getting over it and would tell him to try his best to not to live the gay life. My opinion doesn't stem from any religious background; I'm apathetic towards any personal god.

I certainly hope that gay people can find their way into acceptance, and I will vote for gay marriage if necessary probably because the issue of homosexuality doesn't directly affect my life. Strange?

***EDIT***
I agree that I do have something against homosexuality. If I didn't, I wouldn't say that I would tell my child to not live the gay life if he/she were gay. 

It's important to understand where my dislike for homosexuality comes from, and I suspect it is due to my upbringing. I was raised in a family that doesn't think about homosexuality too much if not at all. When we actually discuss it, no one seems to care and everyone tries to talk about something else. So toward the subject of homosexuality, we are both evasive and scared. I had lived with that attitude until I got into college when I started meeting homosexuals. 

Superficially, I see two types of homosexuals: 1) the flamboyant ones, and 2) the ones who look and act straight until one day they come out of the closet. I can't stand the former group because when I think about them, the image of buggary appears in my mind. I'm not enemies with them either. I just don't talk to them much. I am fine with the second group; in fact, some of my very good friends belong to this group.

I tell people of both of these groups the truth - that even though I would support gay equality like gay marriage, I don't think I can tell my child to go and live a gay life happily. 

I've come a long way to where I stand in the subject of homosexuality. When I was a freshman, I was all ""ew gross"". Now that I'm a senior, I don't really care until the subject affects me directly. 

And returning to the original purpose of starting this thread: I suspect there are an abundance of people who are like me. They claim they have nothing against gay people; they would vote for Proposition 8 and go to gay parties for fun. They also deny that they wouldn't say anything against their children if they turned out to be gay. But when the problem of homosexuality hits them right in the face, they would say the opposite. This makes them untrue to themselves and more importantly gay people who gave them their trust.

It got to the point where it was painfully obvious that we both liked each other, I'd ask her out, and boom, we'd be a couple.

I can't really picture how dating strangers would work though. So you randomly meet someone and you have a conversation and you get their number. Okay. Then what? How long do you wait to send them a text? What would you even talk about over text? My text conversations usually end up being very brief and impersonal.    
So that's one problem. I guess the next step is at some point you'll set up a date. You go out for some drinks or whatever, get to know them and stuff. set up more dates. What do you do then if you don't like them? Do you come out and say ""I don't really like you. Lets not go on any more dates""? What do you do if you do like them? What's the next step?     
Also, when you're in the ""dating"" stage, can people typically be in that stage with multiple people at the same time? Are there some specific dos and don'ts that might not have occurred to me?

A man rode by on his bicycle, and waved to me.  I waved back, as it is courteous.  He seemed to take this as an invitation, and turned his bike around to come talk to me.

From the beginning, it was obvious he was mentally handicapped.  He asked my name, and we conversed briefly.  Eventually, he asked me if I had holes in my socks.  An odd question, no doubt, but he was retarded.  ""No, I don't,"" I replied with a smile.  

""Prove it,"" he said.  So I thought I would humor him, and pulled up my pant leg to reveal my very much intact socks.  To my surprise, he lept at my foot and grabbed my shoe.  ""That's odd,"" I thought.  

""Can I have my shoe back?""

""Sure, I'll put it back on for you.""  My better instincts told me something was afoul.  But I went with it.  I extended my foot so that he could replace the shoe he had taken.  To my surprise, instead of putting my shoe back on, he just took my sock.  

""Hey, I trusted you!  Give me back my sock.""

""I'll put it back he said.""  

""No way, that's what you said last time, and you stole my sock.""  We argued back and forth for a few minutes.  Realizing he had a bike, and I had no shoe, I figured he had the upper hand.  There was no bargaining, no reasoning with him.  I was powerless.  Eventually I capitulated.  We agreed, I would sit on the curb and he would put my sock and shoe back on.  But I knew his tricks.  I was sitting on my other foot.  So I gave him my foot, and to my surprise, instead of putting my sock back on, he started licking my foot and rubbing it all over his face.  I was shocked and shouted.  A look came over his face, as if he suddenly realized he had crossed the line.  He dropped my shoe and sock and rode off on his bike into the sunset, never to be seen again.

On 2010-05-25 I purchased a Barnes &amp; Noble (hereafter referred to as ""B&amp;N"") 3G nook (serial number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-0039), hereafter referred to as ""3G nook"" as an early birthday present. At the time of purchase my wife and I were told the surface of the buttons on the nook might crack with most of the demo nooks having a crack. We were told if the buttons cracked replacement or repair would be easy as it was a known design defect.

On 2010-10-02 I purchased a Barnes &amp; Noble WiFi nook (serial number XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-0052) for myself, hereafter referred to as ""WiFi nook"". A few weeks later I purchased an Amazon Kindle and deregistered the WiFi nook from my B&amp;N account. I gave the WiFi nook as a present to my mother for Christmas 2010. The buttons on the 3G nook did end up cracking at the end of December 2010.

**2011-01-05:**
I visited the Barnes &amp; Noble store in Layton, Utah, hereafter referred to as ""the store"" to have the 3G nook replaced because of the crack. The managers in the store stated that they are unable to provide any help with this issue and was directed to call B&amp;N phone support.

I called B&amp;N at their support phone number (1-800-THE-BOOK) and spoke with a representative after about a 30 minutes wait time.  I explained the crack on the defective 3G nook. She requested, and I subsequently provided the serial number of the 3G nook, store number of purchase for the 3G nook, date of purchase for the 3G nook, my address, the last four digits of the credit card on my B&amp;N account. The representative responded stating that I should receive a confirmation email within 4-24 hours concerning the shipment of the replacement 3G nook.

**2011-01-07:**
I received no confirmation emails within the stated 4-24 hours. After about 48 hours I called the B&amp;N support phone number and spoke with a representative after about 25 minutes on hold. This representative told me that their department does not handle nook concerns, even though I had correctly entered in the digits to get to the B&amp;N nook support department. She transferred me to the correct department after refusing to let me speak with her manager.

After being on hold for another 25-30 minutes, I spoke with a representative and explained the situation and my previous contact with their department. I then asked for a supervisor/manager. The supervisor/manager, Quentin, apologized for mix up, hold times and lack of customer service. He further explained that the 3G nook was not in one of their systems, regardless of the fact that it is identified on their website under devices I have registered with B&amp;N. Quentin assured me he would take care of everything, make sure the device is shipped, and would call me back within 24 hours regardless of whether it had been shipped, just to update me of the status. Furthermore, Quentin would expedite the shipping to 2 day and give me a $25 gift card for the trouble.

**2011-01-09:**
After receiving no confirmation call form Quentin or other B&amp;N staff, I called B&amp;N support phone number after two days. The representative I spoke with told be that Quentin didn't do anything. Again, this B&amp;N representative told me that he would expedite shipping to two day and I should receive a replacement 3G nook Wednesday (2010-01-12). The representative requested a credit card number from me and explained that it would be changed if I did not send back the defective 3G nook within 14 days of 2011-01-09. 

The representative told me I would receive three emails (one with an RMA number, one with a pre-paid UPS shipping label to send back the defective 3G nook, and one confirming the shipment of the 3G nook with a UPS tracking number).

**2011-01-13:**
After four days I called B&amp;N support phone number because I had not received neither the replacement 3G nook or the email confirming the shipment and tracking of the replacement 3G nook. The representative had no clue what was happening but I was given a UPS tracking number (1ZA4928A9091837531). The tracking details on the UPS website states ""A label for this shipment has been created, but UPS does not yet have possession of this shipment. Once we receive the shipment, the tracking status will be updated."" The replacement 3G nook had not been sent.

At this point it seemed the B&amp;N phone support group could not provide any help, as I was being given the run-around and being flat out lied to. I called the store and talked with Blaine, an assistant manager, and explained the situation.  Jamie, a digital products manager at the store returned my call and assured me, that although the store could not provide direct help, she would make calls to B&amp;N phone support on my behalf an escalate the problem. Jamie called me several times throughout the evening to get information and keep me up-to-date as she was speaking to B&amp;N phone support. Jamie told me that I should be receiving a call from B&amp;N phone support within the next day or so and if I had not I should call her back on Monday (2011-01-17).

**2011-01-17:**
I received no call form B&amp;N. Jamie called B&amp;N for me again and spoke to Richard at B&amp;N phone support. B&amp;N extended the original 14 days to 21 days for the credit card charge.  Jamie explained to me that B&amp;N sent out a replacement WiFi nook for the deregistered WiFi nook (!!) and not one for the 3G nook even though I never inquired about the WiFi nook, had deregistered the WiFi nook with B&amp;N and never gave them the serial number of the WiFi nook during phone conversations.

Jamie gave me RMA number XX738 for 3G nook and RMA XX320 for the WiFi nook. Jamie was informed by B&amp;N phone support and subsequently told me that I should either reject the UPS shipment of the mistaken replacement WiFi nook or use the pre-paid UPS label that was emailed to me to send the replacement WiFi nook back.

Jamie told me I would have to call B&amp;N phone support to start the process over again for the 3G nook. Jamie told me I should ask for Richard when I called.

I called B&amp;N phone support and asked for Richard. The representative, Adrian, stated that she did not know who that was. I explained the entire situation for her and she read the notes on my account. After being on hold for a while she told me that she did in fact know who Richard was and that she understood the problem and would fix everything.

Again, I was told I should receive three emails within the next 24 hours (RMA, UPS return label, UPS shipment confirmation and tracking number). Adrian told me to call back the next day if I did not receive all the emails.

**2011-01-19:**
Again, I did not receive all the emails. I did not receive the UPS shipment and tracking number confirmation. 

I called B&amp;N phone support and talked with representative Melvin. He was very confused. I asked if the 3G nook had been shipped and Melvin gave me UPS tracking number 1ZA4928A9094011211 for the 3G nook. Since Melvin was very confused and giving me conflicting information, I asked for supervisor many times and was finally connect with supervisor Wee. Wee confirmed the 14 days was changed to 21 for returning the WiFi nook before being charged for it. Wee gave me UPS tracking number 1ZA4928A9091837531 for WiFi nook (same as one given to me on 2010-01-13). Wee informed me that there was a back order for parts/replacement for WiFi nooks and did not know when it would be shipped. Wee then informed me the WiFi replacement would ship out in 7-14 days.  I asked Wee why they were still processing a replacement for the WiFi nook when they had mistakenly done so in the first place. I quickly realized this confused the heck out of him and dropped the issue.

Wee told me that Adrian requested express shipping. Wee told me there is no tracking number for the 3G. I asked him three separate times if he was sure there was no UPS tracking number. He again responded that there was no tracking number. I asked him why did Melvin give me a tracking number and if he just made it up. ""Probably"" was his answer. He stated the 3G nook replacement will ship out on 2010-01-21.

***Amazon:***
I bought a Kindle. The power button failed to work on 2011-01-03. I called Amazon at 10:30pm 2011-01-03 with no wait time and I received a replacement on 2011-01-05. The screen on the replacement Kindle failed to refresh properly. I called Amazon on 2011-01-10 and I received a replacement the very next day (2011-01-11).

**TL;DR:** Bought a B&amp;N nook for my wife's birthday. The plastic cracked, and B&amp;N knew it would. Called to have it replaced. Cluster fuck of lies and circles. Still no replacement or even a hint that they will indeed replace it after 2+ weeks. Amazon has replaced my Kindle twice with next day shipping and excellent customer service.

I am submitting this to the BBB.

**edit:** formatting and spelling

**update 1:** I got home and was surprised to see that the mistaken WiFi nook replacement had arrived. Just today B&amp;N told me that it had not shipped and probably will not for another 7-14 days. BTW, the UPS tracking number on the package does not match either of the ones given to me by B&amp;N. Still awaiting the real replacement. Thanks for everyone's comments; a lot of them made me laugh.

We posted it three years ago this month.

The first is for all of you who enjoyed an [earlier troll phone call by my 'fingerless' husband.](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/e7m06/to_an_it_tech_apologies_on_behalf_of_my_troll/) The other stories you can take or leave. For reference, we live in Chicago, and almost all the calls came from out of state. 


I first talked to a geezer from Kansas, who was friendly and chatty before demanding a lowball price and delivery of the truck to a halfway point in Missouri. *Oooh-kay,* said I. *We’ll be in touch. Click.*

He called again, belligerent, and talked to the husband.

 **Husband:** Look buddy, I’m not selling you this truck, not at that location, not at that price. This isn’t Meet Me in St. Louis.

**Geezer:**  Yeah, well, I’ve got a tape recording of your wife promising sale and delivery of it, and my son, ** *my son the district attorney,* ** said it’s enough to sue you for breach of contract. 

**Husband:** You’re telling me you’ve got a tape recording. Of a phone call. Of my wife.  

**Geezer:** That I do.  

**Husband:** Well that changes everything. 

**Geezer:** I thought so. 

**Husband:** {to me, mocking} *Hey Sweetie, did you know this guy was tape recording you? No, you had no idea. Really, no idea at all?* {to geezer} You recorded my wife without her knowledge. So now I get to report you and your tape to ** *my FBI son* ** and he’s going to nail you and your dipshit *attorney* son on federal wiretapping charges. 

*{Silence.}* 

Recording this too, buddy? Without my consent? 

*{Silence}* 

You hear that, buddy, that’s the sound of another charge dropping on your doorstep. 

**Geezer:** *click*

**Husband:** *redials geezer, gets voicemail.* That’s right, buddy you can hang up but I’ve got your number!  My next call is to the feds. My son loves investigating assholes. *click*

**Me:** You just *had* to call him back?

**Husband:** Lets ‘em know you’re not jacking around, you’re telling the truth.  You want someone to know you're serious, you give 'em the  call back. Scares the hell out of ‘em every time.

**Me:**  But you don’t have an FBI son. 

**Husband:** And he doesn't have a district attorney son. Fake FBI son trumps fake DA son. He won’t be pulling out that line on anyone else anytime soon.
 

Another call came from a kindly farmer in Southern Indiana, who was intent on purchase, but had this palpable fear of the city, in part because of traffic, but more so because he knew one half of Chicago to be populated by menacing gangbangers and the other half comprised of Mad Maxians, ready to jump him for the pure sport of it.

**Farmer:** Sounds like a good truck. 

**Husband:** It is a good truck. 

**Farmer:** Sure would like to see it. Course ain’t sure I’m wanting to go into that city traffic. Don’t want to run into no trouble up there neither.
 
**Husband:** Tell you what, you get to Tinley Park and I’ll meet you there. It’s a suburb south of the city, big shopping center right off the interstate. Safest place in Chicago, Tinley Park, I promise you that.

**Farmer:** Let me think on it. 

We never heard back. Not two months later, Tinley Park saw the most [heinous crime in its history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Bryant_shooting), one that captured national news. Five women were massacred in a Lane Bryant. The location? That shopping center that my husband promised was the safest place in Chicagoland.

I imagine that farmer is awfully thankful he never bought the truck. He probably has my husband pegged as the Lane Bryant killer. 


As for this last little vignette, *Be Forewarned:* It might take top honors for saddest Forever Alone, holiday edition. 

We finally sold the truck to an exterminator from North Carolina, who wanted to send his guy up on Christmas Day. “Really, Christmas?” I said. “There’s no traffic,” the exterminator replied. “My guy’s good with that, if you don’t mind.” 

The guy flew into O’Hare early, and I picked him up off the El. He was a middle-aged man with tired eyes. As we were headed to the house to pick up the truck, we talked about his long drive ahead, and I made a joke about how terrible his boss must be, putting him on the road like that on Christmas Day.
 
**Man:** *(In the smallest, loneliest tone ever produced by vocal cords)* Since my daughter died, me and my wife, we don’t have much use for the holidays. I’d just as soon be away.

**Me:** Oh.
 
I was caught off guard, and don’t know that I said much else. If I didn’t say it then, I meant to: *I’m sorry for your loss.* I hope time is healing your wounds. I hope this Christmas isn't so lonely.

1286901674.0,416,self.self,dq998,A chick who needs to thank her boyfriend,zorb2007,857,441,233,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dq998/a_chick_who_needs_to_thank_her_boyfriend/,"I don’t expect this to get much attention on reddit but this seemed like the most subtle way to anonymously thank my boyfriend (also a reddit-er) for being an incredible guy, and to thank all the other great guys who seem to also be on reddit.  For the sake of anonymity, we’ll call my boyfriend Mitchell.  

A few weeks after Mitchell and I started dating, I found out that I’d contracted HPV from the only other guy I’d ever been with (we’ll call him Asshole) and that pre-cancerous cells had developed.  My doctor classified it as ‘high-grade SIL’ or moderate to severe displasia.  I was terrified by the news.  I’d dealt with depression since high school and had been suicidal for much of that time, but with different medication and more exercise, I’d begun to feel better and much more stable.  However, on getting this news, hurting myself immediately felt like the best way to fix the problem.  Then I realized I’d also have to tell Mitchell and was scared that he would freak out and would no longer be interested, then I would have lost him and that I would have to go through this alone.  Instead, I told him and we sat on my couch and he held me as I sobbed and tried to explain what little I understood at the situation, what was likely to happen, and what I feared would happen.  I appreciated Mitchell even more when I told Asshole about what was going on and Asshole insisted that because he did not have any problems, I must have gotten HPV while cheating on him.

That was about three years ago and since then I’ve gone through a dozen or so outpatient procedures, including surgery this past winter.  Though all of it, Mitchell has been there, driving me to my appointments whenever he can, taking care of me after a procedure, holding me when I get bad news, and celebrating with me on the few occasions I heard good news.  In between all of this, we’ve had a lot of fun together, taken a few trips, tried some new hobbies, cooked a lot of amazing dinners, and spent many hours just being together.  

I found out yesterday that my most recent test results showed signs of low-grade SIL or mild displasia.  Since the previous lab report had come back negative (no problems), I’d thought the problem was gone and hearing the bad news had hit me even harder.  Thankfully, Mitchell was there when I found out and once again, he held me as I cried. 

I don’t yet know what the next step is going to be but Mitchell seems committed to staying with me and helping however he can.  I told him that I could not have made it this far without him but I don’t think he believes me.  I hope that he reads this and knows how much I appreciate him.

EDIT: Perhaps I should explain that the name ""Asshole"" is not simply because he was the source of the disease (he was the only guy I'd been with, prior to learning there was a problem) but because he refused to consider the possibility that I'd gotten HPV from him.

Not sure what to think.,AxleTheDog,563,149,245,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/svr7a/had_to_clean_up_a_suicide_not_sure_what_to_think/,"(I have no idea where to post this, so putting it up here.  Really don't know why I'm posting other than to talk it out.)

One of the things I never imagined having to deal with in the course of my job:

I'm one of the 'active' partners in a family business - meaning the other owners/partners have retired and I'm left to deal with the day to day operations, etc.  

About 11 am, I took a call from the store where I learned a client came in, placed a call to the police along the lines of ""come get my body"", and shot herself.  The first indication our employee had was the police screaming up to the entry gate and yelling for entrance.  No one actually heard the gunshot.  Police and paramedics found the body on site, in a remote part of the building.  I assume resuscitation was attempted and all that, but was at this point just getting phone updates.

About 2 pm, the coroner released the scene - and the next call told me, yeah - there is no clean up done, all the paramedics do is drape a sheet over the worst of it.

I'm well aware there are probably outfits around specializing in this type of clean up situation, but we are a small business, surviving day to day as best we can - and I did not want to even think about what the cost would be.  The description I had over the phone was ""it's not terrible"".  Also, due to the nature of our business - cleanup needed to happen immediately.  We really can not just shut down and wait.

So, my thoughts are ""I'll go over and check everything out, and if this is something I can handle - I'll just deal with it.  If I run screaming like a girl, I'll have to call somebody.""

I stop at the hardware store and go all Breaking Bad in there: 5 Gallon Bucket, bleach, face shield &amp; mask, chemical gloves, etc.

I get to the site, suit up, and go back to the locked off area.  There is LOT of blood - it was a chest shot that bled out.  TIL that blood is weirdly thick after a couple of hours.  

Gets weird(er) here:  I put on my radio to give me some distraction before getting to work and immediately the first song is Blue Rodeo's ""All the Things Left Behind"" - which was crazy to listen too standing in that room.  Mind is going to some deep, dark places.

I suck it up and get down to business and get the place cleaned up - pretty damn well if I say so myself.  I've told my wife and kids I should now be addressed as ""Wolf"" or ""Mr. Wolf"" (from Pulp Fiction).

I honestly don't have a lot feeling one way or the other about it, but wonder if I should feel *more* one way or the other.  I've learned this lady left behind a husband and children, and I do feel bad for what they are going through, but ultimately she chose a way out that kept the messiness away from them, but dropped it squarely at my doorstep to deal with.

We did get a phone call from cleaning specialist while I was in there working.  They ball parked $ 1,000.00 to get started and didn't think it would go over $ 7,000.

I was raised as a hardcore Mormon in the Mormon Corridor. I have been surrounded by Mormons for my entire life and have dedicated myself to extensive study of the LDS church's beliefs. I know more about the LDS church than most.
Technically, I am a closet atheist and I no longer believe in the Mormon Church. However, I must pretend to be a hardcore Mormon so that my family and friends don't disown me. For the purposes of this AMA, however, I will answer as a fundie Mormon really would.
In the church and the Mormon Missionary Training Center, Mormons are actually taught how to avoid talking about any of their controversial beliefs. They tell Mormons what to say to prospective converts in order to make the church look better and how to avoid answering hard questions. If you ever wondered where Mitt Romney learned to be so vague and evasive about hard issues, it was the LDS church.
Some Mormons begin to believe the new Disney version of the church's theology and beliefs and never even learn what the hardcore Mormons still think. Most still think some of these backward and dangerous things, but will never say so to a ""non-member."" They actually have a doctrine called ""milk before meat"" which justifies lying to non-members and new converts in order to keep them in the church until they can spring the more hardcore stuff on them when they are trapped.
Disclaimer: I am not FLDS or part of a polygamist splinter group. I am fundie from the same LDS church as Mitt Romney.

A shitty ex-wife who I am currently in a custody battle with and who is now not letting me see my daughter and on top of that a few health issues that have only recently begun to be resolved. 

Well a few weeks ago, on a whim I signed up to POF and made a profile. I didn't think much of it and never even really attempted to contact anyone. Then out of the blue I got a message from this beautiful woman introducing herself. I legitimately thought it was a fake spam account or something but I responded. We exchanged numbers and the first night we talked on the phone we spoke for over three hours. I'm 39 and I'm not sure I've ever spoken to anyone that long on the phone ever.

We just completely hit it off. Talking to her it was like I had known her my whole life. we have the same values and outlook on life and it was just amazing to talk to and connect with someone in that way when I've basically been a hermit for the past two years and lost many of my friends due to depression and being a recluse. 

tonight we had our first date and it was like we didn't skip a beat. There was no awkwardness or uncomfortable silences, it was just two people connecting and having a great time. At the end of the night I walked her to her car and we both looked at each other and knew something special had just happened. We hugged, exchanged a brief kiss and I walked away feeling legitimately happy and optimistic for the first time in a long time. 

I still can't believe it's happening. like what does she see in me? but I'm trying really hard to not let those insecurities get in the way of whatever happens. 

this may not seem like a big deal to most people but feeling connected to someone after feeling so alone for so long just sparked a wee bit of warmth back into this tired, old jaded heart and I just wanted to share it with someone.

1311264422.0,412,self.self,ivx9x,I was bartending at a Ruby Tuesday until this morning. This is the 'quit letter' I sent to corporate.,jerseyfresh,905,493,408,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ivx9x/i_was_bartending_at_a_ruby_tuesday_until_this/,"To Whom It May Concern:

I have been part of the Ruby Tuesday’s team for about a month, tending bar at the Toms River location, but that ends today. Before I get into the particulars about why I am leaving, I just want to say how much I appreciate the management team at this location. Bonnie, Mike, Nick, and Carlos care about this company, and strive every day to deliver on this brand’s promise. They regularly interact with customers in a warm, friendly manner; they treat the staff with a fairness that goes beyond what is required. My only reservations about leaving arise when I think about the predicament my sudden absence will cause them, as they are already short staffed behind the bar. 

I am leaving because I don’t make nearly enough money, and it’s a shame because it doesn’t have to be this way. If the management team was empowered to make just a few key decisions regarding the bar I wouldn’t be writing this letter, but that’s not the case. A decision was made to disallow bartenders from picking up tables during times when the bar may be slow, I know because I was forced to sign a piece of paper acknowledging this fact. This decision alone has effectively gutted the day shift for bartenders at our location. Last week I made $8 on one 6 hour day shift, $17 on another, and $30 on another (you can imagine how happy I was on the $30 day). Let me ask you, could you live on $8 a day? These poor paying shifts are the norm, not the exception. So if by some freak occurrence I could make $50 on a day shift, I’d have to average that out with the $8 shifts as well - handicapping my hours, and ensuring that I am in the lowest tier of Ruby Tuesday earners.

Another grievance is with the TueGo, why is it the bartenders responsibility? Perhaps in theory it can be justified, but in practice it is a poorly designed system. How can one person be expected to take care of service bar, take TueGo orders, and still find the time to serve the bar guests with the standard that they have come to expect from Ruby Tuesdays? I understand that you want to save the $3/hr by consolidating as many jobs as possible, but even the guests can see how ridiculous it is to have their bartender spend countless minutes on the phone in the middle of the dinner rush.

Also, how is the tip out calculated? This is the only bar I have ever worked at where the bartender doesn’t get tipped out directly at the end of every shift. Even $25 every night could make a big difference, but this is not the case. Instead, I get the “indirect tips” which I earn from service bar in my paycheck. Here are some numbers: For 37.67 hours, I earned $72.39 in indirect tips ($1.92/hr); For 40 hours I earned $77.03 in indirect tips ($1.93/hr); For 38.53 hours I earned $87.82 in indirect tips($2.28/hr). Let me ask you this, do you think $2 an hour is a fair price for the amount of drinks that go out to the customers, from flavored teas, to mojitos, to martinis, to frozen drinks? The company charges more than $2 for something as simple as a Flavored Iced Tea, and although I may make dozens of drinks in an hour, I am not even being paid the cost of one of those drinks.

As far as my total tips go (direct+indirect), I am almost embarrassed to share the numbers. Not including my wage of $2.13/hr, for 37.67 hours I earned $6.85/hr; for 40 hours I earned $9.44/hr; for 38.53 hours I earned $9.12/hr. Even when you include my hourly wage, I barely break $10/hr in total, pre-taxed income. Do you think those are decent earnings for a bartender? In my experience outside of Ruby’s, bartenders typically earn more than servers - and with good reason. At our restaurant this is not even close to being true, and perhaps this should be the most obvious indication that something is awry regarding the bar.

Each of these decisions regarding the bar may not be such a big deal on their own, but taken as a whole it creates an environment that is not desirable to work under. It’s no secret that going behind the bar is the least desirable position in our restaurant, and with good reason. Why work twice as hard as the servers to make half the money? Experienced bartenders expect a fair wage because they are an integral part of any restaurant. A meal without a proper drink is not complete, and an experienced bartender can make all the difference when it really counts.

I wonder if any of the ‘decision makers’ have ever worked inside of a restaurant, let alone behind a bar. I challenge the people who decided that I’m not allowed to pick up tables to work a day shift at my location and tell me it is reasonable. I challenge those who decided to put indirect tips in a paycheck, at the rate of $2/hr, to actually work a week at my location and then tell me it’s better than getting tipped out every night. I challenge anyone who thinks taking TueGo orders when the bar is full and the service bar is calling to work a week behind the bar and then tell me it makes sense. 

For a company that invests so much in training it’s employees, I am surprised and disappointed that more is not being done to make the bar at Ruby Tuesday’s an attractive and financially viable option for employment. Good luck filling my spot, you’re going to need it.

Sincerely,
Jerseyfresh

There are more fires everyday, and [here](http://www.9news.com/news/article/274324/339/Colorado-on-fire-Wildfires-burn-the-state) on our local news webpage is a list of all of them. Some of the main ones that have effected thousands of families and homes already and are continuing to burn are the High Park Fire (Ft. Collins) The Waldo Canyon Fire (Colorado Springs) and just today the Flagstaff Fire (Boulder)

It has caused individual communities to band together and help out those evacuating and those that have already lost their homes. Now it is becoming a statewide effort to aid those effected by the fires. Another link from the Denver Post has information on how to assist victims by donating or even volunteering your time [here](http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20935254) at the bottom of the page.

Families are being evacuated from their homes, and some wont have ones to go back to. Firefighters are working endless hours in the grueling heat trying to save structures and extinguish the flames. All I am asking is for this to get some more publicity, so that these people can get help. This is a throwaway and a self post, I don't want the karma. I just want my state to stop burning.

Feel free to use the donation links if you can, send some positive thought out to victims and families of the vicitms. Hell if you know how to do a good rain dance that could even help.

Also, need advice on how to proceed...",PoppetFFN,585,174,123,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/wtq18/a_awful_situation_that_ended_up_yeah_im_gonna_say/,"So, I was driving to Austin Tx a week or so ago with my two kids when I had a total idiotic moment and placed my insurance card on my dash where it hid my gas gauge. And yep, I ran out of gas.  I managed to get it off the interstate, on to the access road where there was a GIANT Lowe's distribution center and nothing else as far as the eye could see.

I walked up to the front gate of the distribution center, was buzzed in and proceeded to explain to the two people in there what the situation was. They just looked at me, with no smiles or words of encouragement and said ""well, the nearest gas station is about 3 miles up the road"".  I had my two kids with me and it was about 100 F outside. I asked if there was any gas on the premises and that I would be more than willing to pay for someone to help..etc. They just looked at me kind of slack jawed and said they couldn't help me. I started to tear up and asked if they at least had something I could put gas in.  NOPE they said. 

I turned and stomped off to my car, kids in tow and bawling like a baby (me, not the kids). I then noticed a big 18wheeler pulled over on the side of the road about 100 or so yards in front of me. I grabbed the kiddos and walked up to the huge truck and knocked on the door. Down came the window. I explained my situation to the driver while he looked at me over his dark sunglasses without smiling until I was finished. He then said ""yeah, those people in there are ASSHOLES"" and gave me a big smile and hopped out of the truck. Come to find out his wife was in there unloading her truck and he was waiting out of the gate for her to finish. He called her and explained what was going on. As soon as she was finished in there, she drove down the road and bought me some gas.  The other trucker and his nephew waited with me and my kids at my car until she returned. 

He was the nicest and FUNNIEST guy ever. He talked about raising kids, told funny stories and lectured my kids about staying out of trouble.  His nephew showed pictures of his two babies and talked about learning how to drive a big rig, etc. The wife showed up a while later (it takes a long time to drive one of those giant trucks down to get some gas)  She had bought me a big gas can, had it filled up with 5 gallons of gas. The nephew insisted on putting it in my tank so I wouldn't have to smell like gas. The wife would NOT take any money for any of it. She said it was her good deed for the day.

They were some of the nicest people I have ever met. After it was all over, my kids and I were talking about it all and we agreed that meeting them was well worth running out of gas. They made the trip so much better. 

http://i.imgur.com/ppCbv.jpg  I took a picture of them as we were leaving.  I really wish I had gotten their names, or had some way of thanking them properly.  These are good people. 

Now I guess I should contact some upper ups at Lowe's and let them know that their employees at the distribution center outside of Mt. Pleasant TX are ASSHOLES who throw a woman and her two kids out in the hot Texas summer to walk 6 miles to get gas in their car.  Think that will do any good?  

Edit:  So, yeah..after reading comments, I think I'll just leave things as they are concerning the employees at the distribution center.  I'm not one to cause waves.

They then pull me out of the car and the first officer makes sure our stories line up. Then they search the car top to bottom.

So, on the same day I did this this, the school had a ""costume day"" and I came dressed as the pope. Since it was a special day the kids brought cameras and it was all good fun.

I just couldn't think of anywhere else to post it.)

I am saddled with thousands of dollars of student debt (on top of my debt from my undergrad and auto loan). This was to pay for the Teacher Education program that I was required to attend to get a teaching job. The program taught me nothing of substance, and I was not able to complete my degree because you need a job to complete it and I couldn't find one in the right US state, but the debt burden is mine. My salary, by contrast, is almost artistically minimalist.

School administrators treat you with zero respect, while bending every possible rule to save pennies by leaving the copy machines empty of paper and toner, and keeping kids in mainstream classes who need special ed or alternative programs, because the number of spots in those programs are limited. Parents treat you with zero respect, while neglecting every aspect of their children's education and sending them to school illiterate, sleep-deprived and unfed. 

Students treat everyone with zero respect, because no one is teaching them otherwise, but I will not complain about the kids. Enough people are doing that. The kids would end up fine if only we weren't wasting their formative years watching clocks in classrooms.

After only a few years out of a top-20 school, I feel trapped in this profession. Job interviews in other industries never seem to go anywhere. From their perspective, I might as well have been twiddling my thumbs for three years. I wish I had. I'd have less debt to pay down.

I don't have any answers. I wish I had chosen to do something, anything, else.

The DA has offered my brother a plea deal which would put him behind bars for 8 years. My brother ignorantly said no, his ego refusing to allow him to believe that he will be found guilty, probably because he has gotten away with so much in the past. I went to his preliminary court hearing and he refused to talk with his court appointed lawyer, saying he would only talk with his own, whom he hadn't purchased yet. The judge said ''that's fine and all, but while you're in this court and you haven't brought your own, you will work with this lawyer and you will respect this court''.. 

His girlfriend was there despite saying she had every plan on leaving him. Apparently he has called her constantly and all the sob stories have gotten her to believe he is going to change and is now staying with him. She was at the court house sobbing during the hearings, I was not nearly as moved emotionally. 

The woman who handles connections between the DA and the Victims has told me that they fully plan on seeking the full punishment now that he has refused the plea. My brother could be looking at 50 years in prison, heartbreaking yet just in my mind. 

My mom is a mess, knowing that either way she could have had a son dead or a son in prison. She doesn't know what or how to fell and it kindof hurts me, because I need and want my mom to help me emotionally and be there for me.

1357744297.0,406,self.self,1691ro,Just finished 6 months of job probation - here's what I learned,throwaway1980guy,554,148,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1691ro/just_finished_6_months_of_job_probation_heres/,"I've worked for over 6 years as an IT guy at a higher ed institution.  Six months ago, I was called into an impromptu meeting and found sitting across from me was my supervisor, my director, and the director of Human Resources.

Apparently, a complaint had come down the pipeline from a high-profile administrator about my correspondence response time.  The particular e-mail exchange was this person asking advice about purchasing a computer for her mother across the country.  If allowed to, I could have provided copies of all the e-mail exchanges showing I had responded promptly, as well as e-mails of my director checking in and following up on things and his ""good job, thanks for taking care of that"" e-mail.  

I wasn't allowed to.  I wasn't given any opportunity to defend myself, and I was a whisker away from being fired because of a baseless complaint I would have been able to refute.  When I expressed my frustration with this, I was told by my director, ""Perception equals reality"", and if someone has the perception that something is wrong, then it needs to be fixed.

Instead of being fired, I was put on six months of probation, which included weekly check-ins on progress, regular performance evaluations, and a written plan of action.  

Probation ended at the calendar year mark and I had my last meeting to discuss things yesterday.  Everything wrapped up nicely with everyone patting me on the back, lauding my performance improvements, my organizational improvements, and my improvements to customer service.  The thing is, I didn't actually improve any of these things - in fact, they're worse than ever.  So how did I come out shining?

Simple:  I stopped putting myself out there.  I care deeply about my job and the work I do.  I love the people, I love my coworkers, I love the challenges, I love the opportunities for innovation and collaboration.  While I was on probation, though, my focus was on being as small and unseen as possible.  I stopped volunteering for things.  I deferred work orders back to the Tier 1 helpdesk and offered some guidance toward a solution.  Faculty and staff that used to call me directly learned to call the main line after I would direct them there before taking on their issues.  I put a wall up around me and did just enough work to not look like an asshole during my weekly meetings.

As a result, there were no complaints.  There was nobody on campus talking about me, good or bad, and in the minds of my superiors, that's a good thing.  Last year, I developed a custom imaging solution that provided zero-touch system imaging using WIM files that changed the face of how we deploy systems and update labs (even got to present it at a national lab manager conference).  I walked us through a major vendor change that got us better hardware and saved us $80,000 that year alone with an additional $80K each year for the next two years.  I got smiles and waves from faculty as I walked around campus.

This year was different.  There were no solutions, no new labs, no projects to make our lives easier or our student's computer experiences better, no vendor talks or negotiations to save us money, nothing but putting fires out and keeping my head down... and my director couldn't be happier.

Now that probation is over, I'm looking forward to getting myself back out there.  Looking forward to developing new solutions and accepting new challenges.  Looking forward to loving my job again.

The main thing I learned during my probation is that when a department, company, or supervisor allows perception to equal reality, then you wind up with employees whose **only** focus is on managing perception.

----

**EDIT** - Just wanted to answer one really common question:  ""Why don't you start looking elsewhere?""  Well, that's a multifaceted answer, really.

First of all, I kinda am.  Not actively, but my resume is polished and I'm keeping half an ear open out there.  Largely, though, I love the area I'm working in, and there just isn't a lot of tech out here.  I don't want to move and the prospect of getting a similar job without relocating is pretty nil.  Also, I really do love the work I do and my coworkers are almost like family.  I have plenty of reasons to stay and only this political BS from my director as a reason to leave.  Maybe I will in time, but I'm not dusting off my suitcases just yet.

As far as the question, ""Have you learned nothing from this experience?"" - I stand by the lesson I learned.  Now that I'm done with probation and can be a little bit more of a risktaker, I intend to do just that.  I'm going to continue building up and excelling both myself and this university, but will also ALWAYS keep the perception of myself and my job in the back of my mind.",,False,,t5_2qh96,1357753868.0,,,True,t3_1691ro,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1691ro/just_finished_6_months_of_job_probation_heres/,

Seriously.,rattlemebones,671,267,700,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qu928/fuck_our_us_health_care_system_seriously/,"I'm ranting here because I don't really have any other outlet.  Being a full time employee where my company pays for my health insurance, I am very happy that I can get the medical coverage I need.

That being said, my girlfriend also works at the same company but she is part time, thus she gets no medical benefits.  Last July, she abruptly began experiencing severe pain in her abdomen.  Severe enough that she could barely walk or talk.  After an hour or so we decided she needed to go to the ER, insurance or not.  

At the ER, she is diagnosed with a large kidney stone and a severe UTI.  They keep her medicated and put her through an MRI.  They gave her antibiotics and tell her that the stone, while large, can be passed.  

The bill was $10,000.  Now, luckily they told us about a program that helps uninsured people pay their bills and we actually got away with paying a few hundred dollars and they squared it with us. 

We immediately contacted Blue Cross to setup health insurance for her because it was very reasonable at $119 a month.  After we get all setup, they contact her and tell her its actually going to be $600 a month because she had a ""pre existing condition.""  Obviously, we dropped the plan because there's no way in hell we can pay that.

Now, the pain is back and there's nothing we can do because I don't think you can get a huge hospital bill waived twice.  We can't get health insurance because of this pre existing bullshit.  We can't go to the doctor because it will run $10,000 to $20,000.  

We are both young working individuals who pay our bills and just try to live a meaningful life and she can't get the help she needs for such a small medical problem.  But if we were crackheads on welfare, we'd be taken care of.

I don't know if any of you have had a kidney stone, but apparently its comparable to the pain of giving birth.  Its not extremely bad right now for her, but its still there.  Which means at any time now she can go from being ok to being unable to function from the pain.  

To hell with our health care system.

Redditor for 10 months. (That account specifically)

***

All my posts hit the spam filter of every single subreddit I post in. This is proven on several accounts, will elaborate later. I was forced to make a new account to write this post.

If you check my comment and post history, I have no spam whatsoever. Reddit has very trigger-happy bots or clueless admins that managed to get me silently banned.

Silent bans are used to throw off spammers. What happens when you are silently banned is your posts only appear to you and moderators. Moderators have to manually allow your posts through. [This](http://i.imgur.com/sTwnQ.png) is a test post in a subreddit I made to illustrate this phenomena. All my links, selfs, and comments do this, site-wide.

More proof? A mod at /r/gamingpc [discovered my situation](http://i.imgur.com/PQwqO.png) yesterday. Excluding mod saves like yesterday, I haven't been upvoted, downvoted, or replied to in [A whole month](http://i.imgur.com/5beV6.png)

So I can safely assume I have been silently banned for a whole month.

***

I am writing this post for several reasons:

* I want people to be aware of false silent bans, to allow them to suspect it themselves

* The admins won't answer my PM's

* My account has amassed a small but fair amount of karma, is nearing a year, and has a gold subscription.

Also, I think you would agree that it's fair that I request that my Reddit Gold membership either be extended or refunded should it appear that I was in fact falsely banned.

If possible, could you please give me advice on how to get a hold of the admins?

This was no ordinary refrigerator.  This was like the Platonic ideal of a refrigerator.  It had survived earthquakes, riots, droughts, and both Bush administrations.  It was the fridge he kept out in the garage for gaming sessions; it survived D&amp;D versions 1.0-3.5, as well as LAN parties from Shogo, Quake, Unreal, Diablo, through to WoW.  Alas, it failed to survive my moronocity.

Most people would have simply allowed the refrigerator to warm to room temperature and watch the ice magically disappear.  But not me.  In my accumulated 39 years of wisdom and knowledge, I decided to use a glorified ice pick and a mag light to bash away the ice.  Which was going swimmingly well, until I struck one of the last layers and noticed a hissing sound due to the small puncture hole on the side of the freezer divider in the upper left hand corner.  

G-man, I am more sorry than words can express.  That fridge was like a little piece of immortality and it was my epic stupidity that led to its demise.  I am an idiot and I will carry the guilt of this mistake for the rest of my days.

EDIT:
1.  Greg knew what I had done within a matter of seconds of the freon's escape, so no further man-up was required.  He knows, and the purpose of this post was to let everyone else know the breadth and depth of my stupidity.  Although I must say, it has been very theraputic to hear from other redditors who have posted similar experiences.  
 
2. It goes without saying I'm going to replace/repair it...apologies for not making that clear from the outset.  I told him to let me know which he prefers and I'll make it happen either way, regardless of the cost.

3. I am currently contacting several local appliance repair shops in the area.  The two most trusted ones (based on referrals from friends for other appliance repairs) have said to get a new one, echoing the energy savings comments posted here and concerns that other parts of the system are likely to have a high probability of failure given the age of the unit.  Ultimately, it's his call on which direction to go.

4.  Hair dryer...great call.  I see now that would have been the much simpler and technically more elegant solution here.

I never played as a kid, and now I'm in my mid-twenties.  I do all sorts of stuff for physical activity and fitness, but I've always wanted to a *player* of the game, instead of simply a *fan* of one.  I would shoot hoops in the gym occasionally, but I would always shuffle out when the other guys came in and started playing a game.  I'm not a bad shot.  My form is okay and I can fairly consistently knock down a good open shot once I'm warmed up and am feeling my shooting stroke.

But today I finally stuck around and joined a pickup game.  I had been thinking about it for weeks, like it was some kind of med-school entrance exam or something, but it was just a pickup game.  It didn't even last 20 minutes.

I went in with ZERO expectations of scoring or doing anything special and just ran and played within myself.  I tried my best to find open spots on offense, and ran back hard on defense (even though I had to guard a guy about three inches taller than I was.  I'm about 6ft with shoes on which actually is around average for pickup hoops).  My man pushed me hard in the post but I think I held up pretty well.  He only scored once.

I made a dumb turnover though.  I grabbed a rebound, saw a fast break opportunity, and went for it.  I made the pass, but in my excitement, I traveled.  It's funny now thinking about it, but I was *devastated* at the time.

Afterwards there were high fives and ""good game""'s all around, regardless of performance.  It's intimidating, but everyone knows it's just a pickup game.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to more.  Feels good.

My hope is to help others with children understand the signs and changes that occur in a child who has experienced something like this and is actively hiding it.  

The details:  I was a lock-and-key kid.  After school I would walk home and stay in the house with my sibling until my parents got home.  During the summer, however, my mom decided to leave me with the next door neighbor during work hours.  He was an elderly man, pleasant, and generally quiet.  He would wait until my brother had gone out to play with his grandsons and then start with me.  He was never violent.  He would take me into the bathroom and expose himself and give me directions on what to do.  I remember most of it vividly, and I remember it being surreal and dream-like.  I had no real emotional response or fear, because I had no idea what was going on.  I just followed directions.  This occurred more times than I can remember during the summer when I was 7 and 8.  I was a strong girl, and although I had learned somewhere along the lines what was appropriate and inappropriate, I didn't really connect the dots here, because in my mind those scenes of inappropriate touching I learned about were always about someone who was ""mean"" or ""creepy"" or ""pushy"" and you'd end up fighting and running away.

She looked me in the eyes and told me ""we'll be alright.. I don't know you, but I know you're a good guy and will recover""

This woke me up, this put a new shine on my life. This gave me a reason to get out of the dumps and move on with life. I joined a gym, rekindled friendships and became a better person.

I saw her on the weekend, and our eyes locked again. She came up to me all teary eyed and gave me the possibly most important hug of my life and thanked me. She simply walked off after, but we both knew we'd be alright.

I apologise for the little novel, but I needed to say this somewhere and I wasn't sure where - and if this gives hope or thought to even one person, I'm content

TL;DR : sometimes a seemingly small interaction can save a life. and I'll tell you now.. you'll be alright.

EDIT : Gold? Holy shit - thanks anon! Also the typical ""this blew up"", hope everyone got a smile out of this or at least realised in the darkest of times, there will be something or someone to help you.

The second tested us in ways we never want to experience again.

I'm sure there are a few of you that have experienced miscarriage, either personally or through another person. My wife wrote about her painful experience a little while ago and wanted to share it with anyone who has been through similar dark times. There is hope at the end of all this, in one way or another.

We're glad to have finally made it out of the danger zone with this one, though that doesn't mean that something couldn't happen. Despite this, it's always better to focus on what good can come of a situation rather than how bad it can turn out.

This pretty much came out of no where. He has gotten so insane, hes likely going to be let go tomorrow, and I honestly think this might end up with the police involved when they fire him, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

It started Wednesday two days ago from this post.(not going to use real names for this) The person in question, has been working here half a year, never late,efficient at his job, 31( I think), wife, young kid, seemed normal the whole time I have known him. Even has a decent sense of humor, easy going, So this totally blindsided us.

About 8:30am My buddy, the backup supervisor comes over to me, and starts saying how ""Matt"" has gone fucking mental, talking about opening portals to other dimensions or some shit, and its his mission to ""save"" as many of us as he can. Of course I didnt believe him, or thought that Matt was joking. My backup supervisor then says how he also thought Matt was joking so he started laughing at him, and Matt got totally furious with him.

I still thought he misunderstood something that Matt said, and so he says, 'Just fucking watch, he said hes gonna ""save"" all of us'. Sure enough, about 15 minutes later, he wanders over to me, looks around to make sure no ones around. This is one of the weirdest conversations of my life, I had some warning at least, I'll try to get it right. I had some warning this conversation was coming, so I try to be **VERY** polite, remembering how he apparently flipped out when he was laughed at.

Matt ""Hey... you have some... Interesting Facebook friends...(Matt isnt on my face book, wtf?)
Me: ""Who are you talking about?""

At this point he looks confused

Matt:""It was Richard."" (I dont know any Richards, and I checked my facebook as soon as I got home, no one has been posting any crazy shit like this on my wall)

Matt:""It doesn't matter, Hes going to help me, and he can help you too.
Me:""Help me how...?""

Matt ""In two years, there's this planet that's going to crash into ours, the only way to be saved is to separate our souls from our bodies and go through the portal to the other dimension, but we need one more person to complete the circle, once we have the last, we just need to find a small animal for the sacrifice. The Ritual is this weekend""(Red flags are going up in my brain right here)

At this point I'm a bit stunned, I just stare at him for several seconds, trying to figure out if hes trolling me. (hes never done anything like this before, even as a joke) He stares back with a blank expression. 

So, I dont want to say anything to piss him off.

Me ""I don't really believe in that stuff.."".-he interrupts me

Matt ""You NEED to just believe!""

Me "" I cant.""

And then, and then he fucking gives me this dead eye stare, and in an emotionless tone says

""Then you'll burn."" And walks off.

He then went around talking to everyone else, trying to get them to join, even my actual supervisor(!), who basically told him, ""Believe whatever you want,but leave me the fuck out of it"" Though there was a few certain people he told couldn't join, because they were ""un-saveable and tainted"". 

From there, things went  downhill, and even more batshit crazy. Me being super polite to him when I was talking to him, comes back to bite me in the ass,since I was the only one who fully heard him out, he decided I was his best bet at conversion or whatever.

Around, 11:00ish, hes walking by me in the hall, and shoves a folded paper into my hand, I only have time to say ""What-"" but he didnt even miss a step, and keep on going without looking back.

Shit, so do I even want to open this? Not really, but I do anyways. I shit you not, this is what it said, printed in pencil.

Join us.
We need you to complete the circle, YOU MUST BELIEVE. YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE.

PS, we will talk about plans for your future once we are in the other world.

What the fuck.

The rest of Wednesday goes by without much incident, other then him giving everyone that fucking dead eyed stare, people were generally avoiding him at this point, myself one of them.

And then comes today(thursday). Shit goes to a whole new level of WTF, starting as soon as I get in. My supervisor decided to take an holiday today (great timing) but he always leaves us lists of things he wants us to get done in the day.

So I'm looking over my list, written in pen, and then at the bottom of my fucking list, written in pencil and all caps, **JOIN US**

For fucks sakes, I am really avoiding the fuck out of him now, and hes fucking stalking me at work, literally. I was talking to a coworker, and hes all like ""Dude, do not fucking turn around, hes giving us the stare""

So we just make small talk for a few minutes, quietly asking if hes still there ""yup"", and eventually he goes back to work.

This happened several more times that fucking hour. And the next. 

Then shit gets real, one workers from up front who I'm buddies with comes back to get Matt for a phone call for him, I hear yelling, ask what the fuck that was about.

It was his wife, asking if he was here, he hasn't been home in two days straight, and he wouldn't talk to her.

Shortly before lunch, I'm talking to my backup supervisor, and Matt, yet again, is poorly hiding behind some objects watching us. So Its like, enough of this, I go over to him, and hes got a fucking boxcutter knife, blade out, and hes fucking *stroking* it, while giving me the dead stare. He keeps doing it for several seconds, as if he wants me to see it, then goes back to work. The backup supervisor saw this decided its time to confront him. He says to Matt that hes scaring people, and to just focus on his work to which Matt yelled ""I DONT ANSWER TO YOU ANYMORE I ANSWER TO A HIGHER POWER,YOUR GOING TO BE A SACRIFICE!"", and I shit you not, made the sign of the cross like he was warding him off.


His reaction to me ""That's it. Hes fucking done. I'm getting him fucking gone tomorrow morning when the boss gets in""

My WTF meter is on fucking defcon 1 at this point, and I make sure I'm not doing anything alone for the rest of the day.

And now, I get to see what fun Friday brings.

**TL;DR**Coworker goes batshit crazy.

**UPDATE** Oh wow this thread exploded while I was at work. There's no easy way to say this so I'll get right to it.

My coworkers Punk'd me.(Their words)

Yea I'm not a happy camper at the moment, the knife thing was taking it too fucking far. They actually agreed with me there and bought me donuts and coffee as a small apology for that part. if anyone wants about further details I'll write them up past this point.


From where I left off before, I did go in a bit early, my backup supervisor was in, I got Matt's last name and phone number from him, and as I'm literally about to call his wife, he stops me and gives me the big reveal. They were fucking with me. Most the interactions Matt had with me and others were thought up hours in advance, though some were pure improv based on how I reacted.

Matt and my backup supervisor were both the masterminds in this. half a dozen other people were in on it, including my main supervisor, and the guy who went to get Matt for the phone call from his wife which never actually happened.

They had actually had events planned out for the rest of Friday, escalating things to even more insanity, Matt was going to start passing me more notes, each one to be more unhinged then the last, and one of them would even have fake bloody finger prints on it. For the grand finale Matt was gonna switch his box cutter for a huge ass kitchen knife, with some of the fake blood on it, and then fake stab my backup supervisor near the end of the day.

I work with assholes, fffffffffuuuuuuu. In hindsight I see some clues I missed, such as why no one else was willing to take action on this, and were prolonging getting him fired to Friday instead of right away. I told Matt he should move to fucking Hollywood, That was damn fucking good acting. Shit some of my other coworkers were even creeped out by his acting. *while being in on it*.

I am off work today and it seemed fitting that one of my animals would give me work to do. It was a really weird puke, but puke is weird anyway so I didn't think much about it. A short while later I notice him puking again and trying to hide it. 

A short trip around the house yielded many pools of orange-ish, red vomit. I have hardwood floors downstairs, but the 8 deposits were all upstairs on the white carpet.

Near one of the pools I located the chewed up wrappers of 2 packs of sugarless gum. Now that I had the smoking gun, I felt a little better about it because I really didn't know what to think was wrong with him.

As I started to clean up the mess it dawned on me to check to see if sugarless gum is toxic to dogs. It turns out that it can be and very much so. This gum, Trident, contained xylitol which can cause low blood sugar and liver failure.

I took him to the vet and his blood sugar levels are okay, but his liver and pancreas enzymes are not. The vet is keeping him overnight on an IV of something.

I just wanted to spread a little awareness because from what I have read you need to act fairly swiftly to give your dog a chance. The vet seemed to think he would be okay, but when I left him I had one of those moments.

He is a crazy ass dog, but I love him. He led the strike steam to kill Osama Bin Laden and is the lead candidate to replace Rudolph to fly Santa's sleigh (in my mind at least).

Let's take a closer look at this snake:

1. You were the exclusive domestic wireless carrier of the iPhone for over three years.

2. For those years in exclusivity, you sold just a fraction of iPhone inventory, compared to Apple Stores each year, for the simple fact that you did not want to give commission to your own pressured, hardworking employees, especially when Apple salespeople can sign up contracts to new customers, collect activation fees, and sell accessories, all for free.

3. You increased the price of the unlimited data plan for users going from the iPhone 2G to the iPhone 3G, while no longer including the small text messaging plan.

4. You also forced all users who had iPhones, regardless of off-contract or hand-me-downs, into these data plans. You also refused to unlock the iPhone, regardless of legitimate reasons.

5. You sat back and collected the revenue from iPhone users, laughed at the other non-iPhone wireless carriers losing market share, and neglected your wireless infrastructure while ignoring the complaints of iPhone users who were having trouble making simple phone calls, to the point of public ridicule on late night talk shows.

6. Instead of listening to customers and using the revenue to build out your burdened infrastructure, you instead introduced two pointless PR campaigns, Seth the Blogger Guy and Rethink Possible, as a means to establish some sort of damage control.

7. You went from unlimited data plans to paltry tiered plans, with no limit of repetitive charges, for both iPhone and even new iPad 3G users, a month after its worldwide release.

8. For the loyal, early, and long-standing subscribers who bought into the unlimited data plan, you reward them by threatening them and throttling them at your own discretion.

9. You tweak your network speeds and demand that Apple call it 4G on their devices, just so you can compete with carriers who have moved to LTE or truer 4G bandwidth speeds.

10. You directly blame customers for all your offerings, which you now claim to be your mistake, and for them using your network in the manner it was intended.

11. You attempt to acquire T-Mobile, purposely mislead the FCC, FTC, the USDoJ, consumer advocate groups, the mass media, and the general public about practically everything to said acquisition, then after your surprise at its failure, you gloat at T-Mobile for laying off employees.

12. Even with your overpriced text messaging plans, you're surprised and complaining that Apple's iMessage service is distrupting your revenue stream.  Note that RIM's BlackBerry Messenger (BBM) has been around for years using a similar internet-based infrastructure.

You pretty much represent everything wrong with Corporate America.

1322509587.0,394,self.self,msc5b,To those who think they can't,,579,185,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/msc5b/to_those_who_think_they_cant/,"I'm writing this for you. I'm writing this in hopes that maybe one or two of you out there will read this and maybe become motivated to take control of your lives.

I've been where you are. You're confused about what you want to do, you feel like you're a failure and that you're inevitably stuck in this unfortunate limbo of bad decisions and uncontrollable misery. 

Growing up, I basically just shut out the world and reality. I hated the thought of growing up, and owning responsibility. I played video games and did anything to make me feel happy in the moment. I didn't have friends, I didn't want friends. The friends I did manage to make back-stabbed me and I became even more jaded towards the humanity of my generation.

I never tried in school. I was too focused on getting home and playing around on my Playstation or IM'ing some random people online. I used to be lazy beyond belief. Sure I showered every day, but I never kept organized, or kept my living space clean. I never spent time after school on homework, literally even in high school I did work at school and nothing at home. I used to sleep in and waste away my days, carelessly blocking out reality. 

This kept up for years and years, and that brings us to about 9 months ago when everything changed. 

Last year, going into an engineering program way over my head, I failed out after not giving a shit and not trying. I was almost a hundred pounds overweight, and unhappy. When Christmas came and I was informed that I would not be able to attend second semester, it dawned on me that something needed to change. I decided to re-enroll in the program for the following year and take some time to better myself personally. Nobody understood, but I didn't work, I didn't go to school. I stayed home for 5 months until my previously lined up summer job came around. Incidentally, when I failed out, in the same month I lost my 12 year old Golden Retriever, who was basically my sister growing up as I was an only child. I promised that I would change things for her and for myself. 

I started running every day, at first 15 minutes a day, then 20, then 30, and then an hour, about 8 kilometers, sometimes I would do it twice a day. I also started eating whole foods, nothing that came in a package with the exception of canned tuna. This was **very** difficult. I used to eat somewhere between 3000-4000 calories a day at 250 lbs, and I went from that to about 1400-1500 a day of whole foods and vegetables. 

I also started reading, looking into the engineering program that I so desired a life in. I found new interests such as the obvious fitness and cooking, theatre, musical instruments, etc. I started listening to new music and watching classic movies. I found so many things that I never thought I would have loved as much as I do now. When I was young, I would just do one thing over and over because it made me comfortable in the moment, but this wasn't the case. I've never been so versatile and interested in so many things. 

With this new found knowledge, and control over what I was eating and doing in the day. I found myself being able to control a lot of things. I have heavy anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder, and I was able to control both without medication or therapy. 

Fast forward to July. I turn 20, I've lost 80 lbs in 7 months and I'm ready for whatever September brings in my new school year. I've never been so confident, happy, and the level of self-awareness I currently possess is absolutely astounding. Growing up, when I thought about the future, or where I would be next year, it made me nervous, and I would just immediately think of something else, or play another video game. I would block out the thought of me putting effort into something now for some fun later. I didn't see the **big** picture, and now I do. *Work now, play later*. I've lived by this for the past little while and I can assure you, it's worth it. 

I used to be terrible in math, and now I'm getting 85-90's in electrical engineering in college. I used to think I had no control over my weight, what I ate, etc. 

There is no limit to what any of you can do. Trust me, I was up there as possibly the worst case and I managed to grab a hold of my life.

You can too.

Anyway, this probably won't even get views but I felt like sharing my little story. Don't ever give up, and don't ever think you can't do something. There is no reason you can't do ANYTHING you want to. 

**tl;dr**: Extreme case of laziness and no motivation. It took me failing to realize that I didn't want to fail anymore, so I lost 80lbs, gained a lot of self-awareness, started trying in school and am finally seeing the big picture and where I want to be in 2, 5, even 10 years.

I'm not one of those guys who pithily makes 2 posts and zips to 10k.  I've been creeping toward it for 3+ years.

Originally what I was thinking was I'd offer a dollar for every net point this post gets, but then I worried that if by some ridiculous chance it went crazy I'd be in trouble--with my wife, if not my bank book.  Then I thought maybe I could set up some sort of sliding scale, but that just seemed too complicated.

So finally I'm not sure what to offer--something probably between 25 cents per net point and a dollar per net point.  How's that?

The charity to which I'll contribute is [Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children](http://www.tsrhc.org/).  It's a pediatric orthopedic hospital which provides free medical treatment for any child who needs it.  

I know how marvelous what it offers is--not just because of the web site, but because I was a child from a very poor family who received its services (2 sets of surgery).  If it were not for TSRH I never would have been able to walk without braces, to play sports, including college ball, to run after/from my children as we play, to walk along the beaches of the Mediterranean or under starlight on crystalline cold nights in Maine.  

I owe TSRH a lot.  To say I've never forgotten what those doctors did for me is an understatement.

Anyway, this post is not really about me.  It's an excuse to donate to a great cause, and I'd appreciate your playing along with me to celebrate the gifts I have been given in life--including, of course, reddit.  (And certainly of course if you thought TSRH was a worthy charitable cause for your own giving, on behalf of all the children you'd help I'd say thank you.)

...Oh I better give it a timetable, too, so I can get the donation off to the hospital.  Maybe until Monday, 4/4?  I won't have hit 10k by then, but that's all right.

OH!  Also!  Right now the hospital has its annual [""Cotton Patch Challenge""](http://www.tsrhc.org/cotton-patch-cafe-challenge.htm) going, which means that the Cotton Patch Restaurant (I've never heard of it but people in the southern U.S. may have) matches donations dollar for dollar.  So the donation will in effect be doubled.  

Plus!  The restaurant gives out $25 gift cards to donors--I'll ask that they be given to the children's families.  So we have a chance to do a lot of really positive real-world karma here.

Thank you tons to everyone who helps.

**Edit:** now that the mold's gone, thank you to everyone who's helped.  I guess 4/4 was too long of a deadline, but I'll leave it open until then.  Also I'll post whatever proof TSRH gives me after the donation is done.  Chances are the donation won't be until April 6, as my schedule is heavily booked until then.  But I won't forget and I'll update with verification here.

I don't even mind the people who criticized me.  Maybe one day they'll figure it out.  In the meantime, thank you again to everyone.

**Edit2 for anyone who still cares:** net post count right now shows as 391.  Thanks again to everyone who helped!  I'll make the donation on Wed. and post verification as soon as I get something useful from TSRH.  Typically it sends snail-mail, so I'll post that when it comes.  Really appreciative to everyone for sharing with me.

**Edit 3:** I doubt that anyone's paying attention anymore, but I donated $1k to [Texas Scottish Rite Hospital for Children](http://www.tsrhc.org/) today (6 April).  I wound up giving it in memory of the son of a friend of mine who was hit/killed by a car when he was 8.  I also donated all 40 of the Cotton Patch gift cards to families of patients.  Also of course the money was [matched](http://www.tsrhc.org/cotton-patch-cafe-challenge.htm), which is awesome.

As I mentioned I'll post the acknowledgment letter when I get it.

The waitress - who calls everyone 'hon', by the way - brought some coffee over for him and took his order.  I didn't really pay much attention to what was going on thereafter, being distracted by the arrival of my own breakfast and the subsequent destruction thereof.  At some point, the young man was served up his breakfast and probably got a refill or two on his coffee.
As I got up to pay my bill, I see one of the owner's of the restaurant coming back from busing the man's table.
""Well, it looks like he took off without paying,"" she said as she walked back toward the register.
""Really?,"" asked someone from the other seated table.
""Yeah.  That's okay.  He was very polite and didn't order anything very expensive.  He must be really hungry, because he ate all the little jelly packets, too.""
I offered to pay for the man's meal after hearing this expression of kindness from a somewhat unexpected source.
""No.  No, thank you,"" she said.  Her eyes started to water.
""It doesn't happen often and he must be very hungry.""

I was sitting behind the driver, and my two friends were up front (total of 3 in his 2003 Suzuki Grand Vitara; all of us wearing seat belts). None us had been drinking but, it was late at night, about 1:30am. The light turned green and seemingly out of nowhere, a Ford Explorer popped up over the hill, blew the red light and slammed into the passenger side of our Suzuki doing about 45mph.

I blacked out for some time and I woke up in pain. I was bleeding from the head and face but, I knew it was minor compared to everybody else. I could see my friends up front were not moving and the front passenger had a severe head injury and was bleeding like no other. I knew I had to get out, fearing a fire could start any minute, and call for help. All the doors had been jammed shut on vehicle so, I had to crawl out of the side window, which was busted out. I was able to make a 911 call despite barely having service and while I waited, I checked up on my friends and the other driver. 

The other driver was hunched over the steering wheel, non-responsive and obviously had no seat belt on. His vehicle barely even crumpled, while ours was just wrapped around his. Eventually, EMS arrived to pronounce the other driver and my friend (front passenger) dead on arrival. My friend who was the driver was airlifted to the nearest trauma center where he later died from internal injuries. I had relatively minor injuries which included big bruises from the seat belt and cuts from all the glass. The Sheriff deputies said this had been the 3rd major accident, with fatalities, in 4 months since that intersection had been changed. They said a new Volkswagen Passat was also hit in the same fashion as us and the family walked away unhurt from it.

This has been very hard on me and the families of my friends and other driver. I've had a very different outlook on life since then. I traded in my 1996 Mitsubishi Eclipse after all this because I know that would never hold up in a crash.

Over time I learned race is a huge deal in the States and that Mexico has a different concept or racism than the US does. 

I was taught that racism was when you believe that one race is better than another; kind of like the Nazis who thought blond hair blue eyes was the master race. So if you refuse to give someone a job because they are black and it’s because you think all blacks are lazy it’s not racism but discrimination and stereotyping... but if you didn't give them the job because you thought black people are lesser beings and don't want to be around them, then its racist. Because of that particular definition I find myself with a very different outlook on racism in the US.

I see a lot whites being scared of being labeled a racist and see a lot blacks scared that all whites are racist and out to get them. 
Here are a few of my opinions

1)	Affirmative action. Nothing is more discriminating that giving me the job because Im Mexican. This takes away any merit of the hard work I did to get where I am, aside of the fact that you are discriminating against whites.

2)	The phrase “reverse racism” is just stupid, racism is racism whether its whites on blacks or Mexicans on whites.

3)	People adopting kids of different races that are too concerned of him/her being in touch with his/her roots. The color of my skin does NOT determine that I’m Mexican, it’s the culture, society and country I grew up in that determines that. his roots will be his family aka YOU

4)	Saying things like “I don’t find Mexican girls attractive” or “I would date a Mexican girl but I wouldn’t marry outside my race” is NOT racist it’s just preference, same way I don’t like how a bright orange car looks and I rather have the red one but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t ride the orange one if I had the chance. 

5)	Stop asking for my race in ANY official document if you are truly an equal opportunity employer who cares.

6)    Dont start calling a white person racist because they took 5 minutes to get your damn drink at a bar but it didn’t cross their mind that the place is busy as hell and its taking a long time for everyone to get their drinks.

7)    You are not racist for asking ""why do all *insert race here* do *insert your observation*"" so when people ask me ""why do all Mexicans eat beans?"" I tell them I guess its a is cultural thing... yes I know not all of us eat beans but who cares, they are not being racist they are trying to generalize because its easier to comprehend.


Thanks for reading my stupid little rant, just wanted to let it out.



TL;DR I like tacos and burritos.  





Edit: I loved reading all you guys comments. On the affirmative action thing, I've sent the paper work to HR to hire some particular people and they ask me to look for some one else because they need to ""diversify"" the work environment and was pretty much forced to take on people who were NOT the best candidates, im not saying those guys didnt know their stuff but they weren't the best ones I interviewed. That is hella racists, I literally was not allowed to hire two potentialiy great employees because they were white. I guess we had enough whites in the company for now.


Edit 2: Its quite interesting to seeing people calling me a troll cuz of my opinion. Let check out

""mmm... this guy's opinion is not the same as other minorities... soo he must be white and a troll!!!""

Some people might say that is racist but to me it isnt, it just that just sounds ignorant.

I recently sent her a Mother's Day card and I got a voicemail from her, almost in tears thanking me for it because she hardly gets cards any more.



This woman is incredible - she ran away from home in Poland as a teen, and when the war started she was aboard a Red Cross train full of women and children trying to get out of the country when it was stopped by the Nazis. She lied and told them she was a nurse, so she spent the next couple years helping wounded German soldiers. One day all of her teeth were knocked out by a Nazi doctor because a soldier asked her not to change his bedpan because he was embarrassed having a pretty young woman do it, and when the doctor found out she was punished and sent to a work camp. After her camp was liberated by the American troops she met my grandpa, a young American soldier who asked a woman with no teeth, no English, and a child out of wedlock to marry him and long story short, she did just that. Her ornate wedding dress was made by hand by other kind strangers in the Displaced Persons camp she was in.



She came to the US, learned to read, write and speak English, drive, and had another daughter (my mom). So the thing is, have a really small family, and my mom recently quit her job to move there and take care of my grandma who has lived alone for almost thirty years since my grandpa died. But since my mom is out there, I'm the only family out of state, and the only family to send her cards. We're not sure she's going to make it to her birthday in July and I was thinking how nice it would be to be able to send her a giant box of cards with some nice words or an early birthday wish. If you have an extra $0.45 to spare and a few minutes to doodle a card and maybe say where you live I really think it would mean a lot to her. 


(She likes birds, Wheel of Fortune, dancing to Polka music, coffee, teaching me bad words and pick-up lines in Polish, and being sassy...)

Send me a message for the mailing address! Thanks!


 EDIT: Her name is Halina if anyone wants to use it on a card.


EDIT: I'll be adding updates once I get the cards and send them to her. I told her today that she should expect a surprise in a couple of weeks and she's really excited (probably expecting more coffee that I send her, but this will be better) I'll get some pictures of her with the cards and see if she wants me to pass anything along to all of you. 

UPDATE: I've started getting cards!! I have about 15 or 20 after three days, and they're all awesome. I'll be sending out a box of them at the end of the week, and I'll make a new post when she gets them. :) 
Here's after two days of getting cards

I'll try and get some sleep now, and I'll go to the University Health Centre tomorrow to see if I can talk to someone. The police called to ask for some more information. That wasn't fun. Apparently nobody knows who the traffic warden at the scene is. The man passed away and the 2 women are in hospital. 

I'm still a little shaken, and I think I just need to get it out of my system. Sorry for the giant wall of text.

I was waiting to cross the road, a road I had crossed many times before. It's a curious road because to make a full cross to the other end, you have to wait for 2 sets of traffic lights. One to the center divider and then again to the other side of the road. Opposite me, waiting at the center divider to cross towards my side of the road was a man and 2 women. The road was about 10-15 metres wide. The lights had just turned red for the cars and we were just about to begin our cross, waiting that extra beat for the cars to come to a complete halt. Just as I took my first step, I heard a shout from a man and looked up to see a huge truck, moving in direcetion of traffic, mount the curb opposite me and plow right into the 3 people there, all, just like me, having taken their first steps to cross the road. The shout had come from the driver. I watched as what must have been 4 wheels ran over one of the women's legs and the man disappeared underneath the truck before it finally came to a stop. It was one of those huge Mcdonalds fridge trucks. The leg was a mess and all you really could see was the yellow of fat and a little bit of blood.  A small stream of blood trickled slowly from the leg. The other woman lay on the ground, seemingly unconcious, and while at first I thought the truck had run over her arm too, she eventually sat up, seemingly unscathed. Behind, underneath the truck, the man lay in a mangled heap. I couldn't really see much, nor did I want to. I did see a much larger pool of blood forming around him. Just as the truck came to a stop, a traffic warden of some kind rode up on his scooter and started his siren. I don't know how he got there so fast.

I took out my phone to call an ambulance but I saw the woman next to me with hers out already. I figured she was going to call so I was about to keep my phone when I realised she was taking photos. Someone on a motorcycle nearby shouted for someone to call the ambulance. I dialed the number and began talking to the operator. I told him as best as I could where the accident had occured and what had happened. I was pretty shaken so it was harder than expected. He asked me if there was anyone underneath the truck and I said yes. He said he'd bring a fire truck or something. I couldn't really hear amidst the racket of the siren. 

I looked at the people around me, the ones who had also seen the accident. One of the women's face was completely gray. She was the first to leave. The moment the light changed again she crossed and went to the bustop across the road. The other 2, a man and a woman were talking about it, exclaiming about how they didn't know what to do, that they were scared, expressing what I could only guess was shock and incrdulity. That was pretty much how I felt at the time. 

At one point the question came up whether or not the traffic warden knew that there was a third casualty under the truck, seeing as he seemed only to be talking to the 2 women. The woman with the mangled leg was screaming (not in pain, but more of in shock, the kind of scream that you hear when you watch one of the clips of people injured at the scene of bombings and stuff, in a long drawn out almost half cry, half scream of anguish and shock and fear). It was not a pleasant sound. THe traffic warden talked to her and then she lay on the ground, motionless for a while before getting up and screaming again. The other woman seemed dazed but otherwise fine except for a trickle of blood down her face. Anyway, we wondered if the traffic warden was aware of the man under the truck and one of the women spoke to another man who had joined us about it. He went over to the warden to talk to him. 

It was about maybe 10 minutes before we finally decided to try and make our way across the road. I tried not to look at the scene as I walked past. My phone rang and I picked up. It was the emergency hotline people. They wanted to know if I had called about the accident and whether someone was trapped under the tyres. I didn't want to look but I looked. The man was in a heap, motionless, under the vehicle, but it didn't seem that he was under a tyre. I said as much. I wanted to leave, so I asked the man on the line if I could. He was slightly hesitant but said ok. While this conversation was happening, the feeling of shock was getting worse for me. I was close to the accident when it happened and now It was right next to me as I waited for the next traffic light change so I could complete the cross. At the same time the woman who had taken the photos was telling me to watch where I stepped. I didn't want to look down. But I did. Strewn across the pavement and the road were these little bits of flesh. No blood, just bits and chunks of flesh and viscera. The one thing I remember thinking then was that it just looked like raw chicken breasts. Not unlike the kind of stuff you'd see at the market. Just lying there. Chicken. Finally we crossed. Passing the bustop on the way home I saw the woman who had run off, her face still colourless. I actually mean colourless here. Not as an expression. Just gray. I walked home, told my dad and cried for while. This was maybe 3-4 hours ago.

Thinking back, it was so surreal. It really was almost as if everything happened in slow motion. I don't even know how fast the truck was going. It must have been pretty fast though. The entire length of the truck had crossed the stop line. I don't even remember much sound at all. Just the initial shout from the driver and a few shrieks of horror from the women next to me (though I am not even certain of that). I don't know what I feel. Shocked for sure, but I don't even know why I felt the need to cry. Now I feel pity, sad for the lives ruined, but then, that wasn't on my mind. I also kind of feel guilty for leaving. I think I could have stayed if I didn't cross the road, but once I reached that center divider it really hit me, the horror of it all. I couldn't stay. But I feel like I should have. I know as I left a paramedic on a bike arrived, and the traffic warden and his siren was there, but I still feel I should have stayed, even if I don't know what for. At least I've calmed down some and stopped shaking. Thanks for listening.

To top it off, just came home to see one of my cats dead on my bed.",Intolight,574,201,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/13m633/its_been_a_hellish_last_3_months_to_top_it_off/,"I could post a picture of my cat and write a tear jerking title but milking karma for my dead cat seems so fucking horribly wrong.  It's like, was my cat's death worth 100 karma points?  Wtf.  

From what it seems, he died in his sleep.  He was still in a sleeping position on my bed when I came home and found him.  I actually bought 2 bags of cat food and came home happy to give my 2 cats some dinner.  Usually, Fat Elvis (that was his name) was the first one to greet me because he knows when I get home, it's dinner time.

When he didn't come to greet me, I felt something was wrong.  Either he ran away because I left a door open or he got scared of something and is hiding.  I did NOT expect to find him on my bed motionless.  This brought back a flood of bad memories from when I was in 9th grade and I found my dog on the side of the road.  I was hoping to god he was just sleeping.  He wasn't.  Now, 13 years later, I had the exact same wishful thinking.  

I tried shaking him a little and I fucking just lost it when I saw a tear drop come out of his eye with a hint of blood.  It was slightly pinkish.  Fuck.  Now here I am, he's wrapped up in my blanket and mattress cover.  No fucking place that can take him is open right now and who knows what the fuck is open tomorrow.  I live in a small apartment complex and there's no way I can bury him in the yard.  


As I type this, I keep looking over at the tied up mattress cover.  Once in a while, I find my other cat, Harley Quinn, circling it and sniffing at it.  I have to call her to come over and give her hugs and pet her constantly.  

Now she's sitting on top of my computer watching me as I type this out.  

The last 3 months, I've been fucking stressed the fuck out because I took on a position in my company to lead our company in a more successful direction.  This has taken a toll.  I've been working 60+ hours a week, constantly yelled and bitched at from new customers who aren't familiar with us and the process and production of our knits. (Work in textile knitting mill)

I've been leading all sales reps in sales but I don't receive a cent in commission because this is my family's business.  I was given chips and told to gamble with it carefully and it's been paying off.  The only thing is, I feel like I'm losing my social life, my love life (broke up about 2 months ago), and my desire to even do anything outside of work and my usual hobbies.

After an hour of fucking breaking down dealing with my cat, I have this fucking realization that, I will work myself to the bone but in the end, what does it all mean?  What's the point when someone's going to find me dead on my bed?  What's the point of this?

Is the fucking meaning of life to just fucking work, work, work, and die?  I wish I could quit my job but if I leave, my family is going to possibly lose the business.  I feel like I'm fucking stuck.  I have no way out and I feel suffocated.  I see no fucking way to ever find a fucking woman because I'm either working or too fucking tired to go out on the weekends, which I'm working Saturdays and occasionally Sundays.  I go to parties and pass out within 2 hours in my car because I'm fucking exhausted.

Do I suffer shit now to hope for a bright future?  But what makes future a certainty?  Who knows if I'll die in a car crash or not tomorrow?  Who knows if this business is still going to go under?  (Ranked #1 domestic industry to be completely gone in the near future)  My father told me, do this so your future family won't have to worry about ever having food on the table.  What family?  I'm 27 and it doesn't look like I'll have a family to feed any time soon.  I cope with stress and depression with humor and doing any activity to take my mind off of stress.  Computer games was my way of coping with stress since childhood and it hasn't changed as an adult.  I grind the shit out of my teeth at night and I've been finding more grey-turning hair than full grey hair, which means, I'm going to be looking forward to a shit load of grey hair in the future.

Anyways, I appreciate anyone who actually took the time to read this rant.  I needed to vent and I didn't do a tl;dr on purpose.  

**Edit:**  Holy hell...  I really never thought I'd get this much of a response for this.  I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time to read this and write back.  Honestly.  I don't even know what to say.  Fat Elvis is going to a pet cemetery tomorrow.  Where he will be laid to rest in peace.  Funny story about how I got him.  My mom bartered this homeless man for $5 for the kitty.  She knew it wasn't his and that it was just a stray kitty.  He wanted $10 to buy some beer but my mom haggled him down to $5 lol.  It has been a wonderful 7 years and the best $5 my mom ever spent.  

Again, thank you to everyone. 

**Edit #2**  I know I should find something I love to do and I actually tried that already.  I worked in film for a few years until the recession hit.  I didn't know anyone in the business and pretty much had to make a name for myself.  Unfortunately, the film industry is very nepotistic so regardless of how good I was at my job, they would always choose someone they've been friends/worked with for a lot longer.  I do try to find time to still pursue what I love, which is/was Cinematography and the closest thing I can do to that is photography.  Even then, I am sometimes so mentally exhausted that I can't bother to even think about taking pictures.

I should also add that I am Asian and there's just a whole different meaning if I quit my job.  The hours are just as much as any of my coworkers as well so it is expected of me to work equal or more hours or I'm looked down upon.  There are no 2 week vacations for me.  We rarely get any holidays off other than the major ones.  Even if I was allowed to take a vacation, I could not trust anyone else to handle my customer's orders.  Not a lot of people can understand Asian families and how work ethic is so important.  I don't expect them to.  I don't even expect that from my friends who always wonder why I can't go out for drinks on Fridays or just call in sick tomorrow.  I'm 1.5 generation so it's hard to try and find a happy medium.  One side of me wants the vacations, work 5 days a week, 40 hrs.  The other side, I don't want to shame my family's name by taking days off or not working extra hours.  I don't know.  I just take it on the chin and roll with it because one day, when my dad retires, the company will be mine.  If there's a company still left by that time.  I've been given a golden ticket and I'm very grateful for that.  While most people are struggling to find jobs, I have been given an opportunity to run my own business that's already been established for me.  That's something a very few people get a chance to have.  I understand how valuable that is and that is a huge reason why I can't just get up and leave.

1344143383.0,385,self.self,xpc7a,"I FINALLY passed College Algebra. Some may scoff, but I feel great.",JCork,580,195,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/xpc7a/i_finally_passed_college_algebra_some_may_scoff/,"I start my junior year of college in just over two weeks.

I'm a pretty bright kid, but math has never been my strong subject (which is weird, because I'm part Japanese. Everyone who knows this gives me crap for being the Asian kid who's bad at math). I've gotten C's, a D, and the occasional B in all my math courses since junior high. However, I'm very good at standardized tests, and did awesome on my ACT exam. My lowest score was in math, and it was a 23. I was able to skip all the not-for-credit college math courses and go straight into college algebra.

I tried to get it out of the way in my first college semester. Bad idea. I was still more of a high-schooler than a college student. I skipped way too much class, and then decided to join a fraternity, which resulted in more skipped class. By midterm, I would've had to score something like a 96% or better on everything that remained, *in order to get a B in the course.* I dropped the class, got like 25% of my money back, and finished the semester with 13 credit hours. 

Second semester comes around, and I decided to try again. I still hadn't quite shaken the high school mentality, but I tried so hard to do good the second time around. I made it all the way through the class, but ended with a D. I felt horrible.

I'm a (prospective) business student. The business college at my school is pretty damn selective about admission. You have to have nearly all of your gen-eds done, including a list of business college-specific gen-eds, before they'll admit you. They require a C or better in College Algebra for admission. I wrote them after my second semester, explaining my distaste for algebra, and my confidence that my grade in that class wasn't reflective of my potential in the business school. They allowed me to take two of the courses that require the C or better in College Algebra before enrolling, no problem. But when I attempted to enroll in the third and final course with a College Algebra prerequisite, they said no. I had to retake it, no exceptions.

I then wrote a very long email, basically stating that the only gain anyone would see from me retaking that course would be the 3 credit-hours' worth of money the university would gain by making me take it again, and that I wasn't happy about that. They didn't care. They gave me no other option.

So, this past summer, I enrolled in College Algebra, again. For the third time. This time, it was an online course. I did all my homework, and two out of my four exams on my computer. The other two exams were in front of the instructor, and thus were weighted much more heavily than the work I could ~~cheat on~~ do at home.

I worked my ass off all summer long, and I actually began to grasp some of the things that baffled me before. I actually knew a thing or two about algebra. I got great grades on all of my homework, and did decent enough on tests. I missed a few quizzes due to a vacation this summer, but it wasn't a big deal, the instructor assigned 15 quizzes but only kept your top 10 scores. I felt pretty good, but I was still far from ""good"" at math.

I took my final exam two days ago, and I was actually sweating as I took it. In a freezing cold room in the basement of the math building, I was sweating.

I finished with about twenty minutes to spare out of our two-hour time limit. I'm usually the first person done when it comes to tests, in almost any subject. I left with no idea of how well I did. I had mixed feelings about almost every question, but I was glad it was over and hoped so badly that it was all over for good.

I finished with a B+. A fucking B plus. I'm ecstatic. I ***never*** have to take a math course again. Ever. And, with my field of study, I'll probably barely use any algebra for the rest of my life. It feels great knowing that the most stressful subject I've ever had, in all my schooling, is completely behind me. I'm actually looking forward to going to class this coming semester. I almost wish I had more than one class to go to every day. I feel like the shitty attitude I used to have about school is completely gone. Yeah, I still want to finish up in four years and get out into the real world, but I don't dread school any more. It's great, and I just thought I'd share.

My grandfather died last October. He was a truly great man and the patriarch of our large family. He was the definition of ""troll (grand)dad""... a very funny man. He helped raise me and my brother; our parents divorced when we were very young and we would spend every summer with our grandparents.


My grandparents had celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary the summer before he died. His death was harder on my grandmother (the most generous, wonderful, intelligent woman I have ever met) than anybody does or possibly could know.


Without having to be prodded in any way, my brother volunteered to move to rural Nebraska for a semester and help her through her grief. We were all happy, but uneasy. My brother has a reputation for not following through with things. He had recently dropped out of his first semester of community college and - to put it mildly - was on the outs with our dad. Everyone was afraid he wouldn't go through with it.


*He left his friends, his girlfriend and his nuclear family last month.* He has really improved my grandmother's outlook on life in the few weeks he's been there. 


Not only has he moved out to the middle of nowhere to help our grandma, but he has also acquired a $11/per hour job at an American Meter plant to fund going back to college. (Understandably, our parents won't pay a dime until he has proved that he's serious about college.) He started work this week and likes his job so far. I am so proud of him.

For those of you unlucky enough to have not grown up with him, Fred Rogers could be described as many things, but in the end, he was simply the most genuine, kindest human being to ever grace a television screen.  
He always emphasized caring, listening, and empathy, or in other words, true friendship. Discovering the wonderful simplicity in a bird's song or the color of flowers on a rainy day was his daily life, and he tried to make that our daily lives. No matter what, even if he had never met a person, that person was both his neighbor and his friend.  
He took the time to answer all of his fanmail personally, which is a gargantuan task, considering that children enjoy writing mail to their favorite characters. He defended and probably saved [PBS in front of Congress](http://video.pbs.org/video/1428499965/), a floor usually reserved for the loudest and most bombastic. No matter what, he never stopped defending educational programs for kids, because he knew that if there was to be children's programming on television, there should be worthwhile material.  
I was lucky enough to watch him on television as a kid, but I had largely forgotten about him until PBS' Mister Rogers remixed video. It made me realize that, although his program was simple and gentle, those qualities made it that much more poignant. His messages of friendship and curiosity and learning are not only worthwhile for children, but for adults as well. Too many of us, myself included, grow up to be cynical and solely concerned with gaining employment for a job I don't like to appease people I don't like all because I need money to live. He always tells us to appreciate the little things in life, because it is the little things that make us appreciate life that much more.  
Tomorrow is his birthday, and it would be incredible if we can begin to celebrate a man who gave all of himself to those who would pay attention. Tomorrow should be a day where we begin life anew with clearer vision than we had before. Don't regard everyone as strangers, but as new friends; if someone is upset, ask them if they're OK; if someone is hungry, buy them a meal.  
Like Mister Rogers would say, every single one of us is a completely different, unique, and wonderful human being, and each one of us is worth knowing and loving. Let's do our part. Let's love each other. No more judging based on skin color, or clothes, or wealth, or accent, or anything; let's just help the person who is not yet a friend. Let's do this, at least for a day. And maybe the day after that. And maybe for a week, or a month, or the rest of our lives.

As I was flying to my conference here in Trento, Italy, I had a stopover in Munich/München. The flight out from Stockholm to München was delayed, citing heavy fog over München's airport. Some irritation on my part, there, as I had hurried to a delayed flight. (Of course.)

I had a colicky baby right behind me all the way over the 2-hour flight, where I had planned to sleep since I hadn't gotten any sleep at all this night. It is an understatement to say that irritation and frustration was mounting. Somehow, I still managed to go into a light slumber as we approached München -- and boy, was it in heavy fog. It looked like flying into a dense cotton cloud and intending to find an airport in there. The fog was so bad you would barely see the hand at the end of your arm.

Fast forward as I doze off, and I'm suddenly jolted awake by jet engines screaming to full burn. I would say ""afterburner"" if I had thought they were fitted. As I look out the window, we are just some two meters above the runway, looking like any landing. The thrust hits me as my back presses into the seat, I see us lifting back off the tarmac again, and fast, in a scream of engine fury, the runway fades below us into the fog. I feel the plane tilting sharply backward to climb, and adrenaline is pumping in every capillary, being nowhere near sleep at this point.

Wow, I thought. An aborted landing. I've been flying a *lot* -- as in, *really* a lot (I've held highest-level frequent flyer cards on TWO chains at the same time) -- and I've had inflight engine malfunctions, emergency landings, but never this particular flavor of exception to the pattern.

That set me thinking of what just happened. There would be two reasons to abort a landing: you miss the runway, or it would be unsafe to use it. The professional pilots of Lufthansa do not miss the runway even in total darkness. Doesn't happen. So the only reason to abort the landing would probably be that we were right on our way into something that was also on the runway, right in our intended path. Could it really? That would have been a very close call. VERY close.

We climbed and climbed for minutes. Out of the fog, into the sun, then just coasting for what seemed like an eternity without an explanation of what had just happened. Finally, the PA crackled, and a very professional but clearly tense voice announced: ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. We had to abort the landing because the runway was... (pause) ...blocked. We will be returning for another landing in ten minutes. Thank you.""

All of a sudden, the delay didn't seem that important anymore. Neither did the screaming baby, nor the fact that they lost my luggage in the short connection.

Thank you, captain of Lufthansa 2415 on Wednesday November 9. I'm sorry I never got your name. I did ask the attendants to forward my thanks for your reflexes as I left the plane.

I haven't been here long, a couple of months, but it's quickly dawned on me that as soon as you go against what popular opinion is on here, you get downvoted, flamed and all rational debate goes out of the window, no matter how reasonable what you wrote was.

I'm talking mostly about the WikiLeaks matter. Because I have the nerve to post an alternate opinion, I get insulted and my points ignored and my posts downvoted. Now I can't say I really care about karma (unless it's redeemable in the form of some sort of stuffed toy?), but I do like to debate and get my points across, which by and large seems impossible on here. Sometimes I might get one or two constructive arguments, but my posts will quickly get downvoted until they're hidden, at which point any chance for another reasonable Redditor to come across it is slim to none.

I don't care if you don't agree with me, in fact I enjoy debating these things back and forth with people who feel differently. It just seems that most people don't want that and only want to read things that agree with their world view. In a sense, Reddit is the George Bush of internet forums; you're either with or against it, and if you're against it you hate freedom.

I really hope that a few people might read this and rethink how they contribute on here, because frankly it's becoming a kinda pointless forum when every thread becomes a circle jerk, iterating the same views over and over again.

You saved my life last night.",iHi,534,156,481,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/a90b5/ive_only_been_in_one_fight_in_my_entire_life_but/,"[tresbeay](http://www.reddit.com/user/tresbeay), wherever you are sir, you saved my life last night. [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/a71pj/iama_murderer_ama/c0g5re3) is the post that I immediately thought of when shit started to go down. I want to thank you, and all of reddit, for the fighting tips that you bestowed upon your fellow redditor cohorts.

The names have been changed to protect myself against any possible lawsuits that may come about from the fracas that occurred last night. Also, keep in mind, this was only the second fight I have ever been in in my entire life, and I am not a strong or muscular person at all. I am tall, however, which definitely helped.

Without further ado, here is what happened to me last night.

My friend, Tiffany, is home from college for Thanksgiving break. We decide to go to a bar to hang out and do a little bit of dancing. I volunteer to drive us; so, I was not drinking as there tends to be a lot of cops in this particular area. After the bar closes, Tiffany gets a call from her friend Leah about a house party a few blocks away. Hoping to get in Tiffany's pants, I happily agree to extend the night even further into the morning. On the way to the party, Tiffany says to me, ""I should warn you that there will be a guy [Frank] at this party that is obsessed with me. He may say some things to us. Oh, and he is a Marine."" Now, I didn't think anything of this, as I am a likable person, and usually get along with everyone and anyone. I should have known when she said he was a Marine, she really meant he was completely unstable and bat-shit insane. I am not saying all Marines are unstable, but this particular one was, as well as shit-faced drunk.

We arrive at the house, I park the car, and Tiffany and I walk into the party. I immediately begin to feel some tension in the room. There aren't many people there (approx. 8 or 9) and the only person I knew was Tiffany. I hear Frank (the Marine guy) from the other room telling his friends how upset he was that Tiffany showed up with some dude, and that he is going to beat the shit out of me. I felt a sense of worry when he started to become very specific about what he was going to do to me.

I tell Tiffany that we should definitely get the hell out of there, as I don't trust any of these guys. I tell her to meet me out front, because I was going to use the backdoor to avoid Frank who was standing right in front of the main entrance. I meet up with Tiffany, and we walk to my car. At this point Frank, and his two buddies are outside and following us. One of Frank's minions runs up to me, and says, ""Where do you think you're going?"" and pulls my off the sidewalk. I know at this point that I cannot get myself in a situation where dudes are holding me down, as Frank rains blows upon me.

And then, like a flash of lighting, I immediately think back to [tresbeay's](http://www.reddit.com/user/tresbeay) Fighting Tip #1, which says to use every weapon you have, including hits to the testicles, sucker punches, eye gouging, etc. And this is exactly what I did.

When the first guy pulled me off to the side, I grabbed his testicles as hard as any man possibly could, and twisted and wrenched those babies to the next century. I can still remember him muttering some really weird sounds in a genuinely terrified tone. But, I guess this guy had some unfinished business with me, and started slowly toward me again hunched over, as I am unlocking the car. I wait until he gets fairly close, and I sidekick him right in the gut. He falls on the pavement, and decides he has had enough, as he rolled away.

Tiffany slides into the passenger seat, as I am opening my door to get in. As I am opening the door, Frank breaks free from the dude that was holding him back, and charges toward me like a tornado of insane. Let me mention here that this dude is huge. About the same height as me, but much, much stronger. He's a Marine, god damn it! I am lucky that I was standing behind the driver side door, or else he would have tackled me and beat me to a pulp. But, instead, I use the door to block him and to keep some distance between us.

I then channel back to [tresbeay's](http://www.reddit.com/user/tresbeay) Fighting Tip #1, and grab the dude's face. My right thumb instinctively enters his left eye, and I can hear him writhing with pain, as I gouge and scratch away at that eye. He pulls back, and barks, ""What the fuck did you do to my eye!?"" He charges again, but this time I had my keys in my hand as I am trying to get ready to drive away from this madness. I take one of the keys, and begin to gouge away at his left eye again. He is terrified at this point, and is muttering ""Is that a key!? Fuck man!? Ahhh!!!"" He falls backward, I jump in the car, and the alarm starts going off. This gives him time to hit the side of my car in anger, as I try to shut the damn thing off.

I peel out of there, my heart beating like 100-120 times a minute, while not believing that I took two guys down within a matter of minutes. It was the single most exhilarating moment of my entire life. Tiffany got a call sometime later from Leah that they were taking Frank to the hospital. All I could think of was how macho this guy thought he was, and how his plan to beat the shit out of me completely backfired.

tl;dr: Reddit saved my life. I am in your debt forever.

UPDATE: I just heard through my friend that ""Frank"" is going to Afghanistan in a few days. So, I won't have to worry about him for a long time, if ever again. The other dude though, not sure what his deal is, but he is no where near as big as ""Frank.""",,False,,t5_2qh96,True,,,True,t3_a90b5,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/a90b5/ive_only_been_in_one_fight_in_my_entire_life_but/,

I felt pretty stupid, but she didn't care that I had said it. We became closer over the following months and I heard a lot of incredible stories about the camps and her time over there. She also told me about a special bakery she used to visit near her daughter's house in Illinois that served a particular kind of polish doughnut. My wife and I just happened to be in Illinois driving by the town the following week, so we found it and bought some. I delivered them to Zelda the next morning (in Wisconsin), and was greeted with an ugly look from the staff who didn't seem to approve.

""I don't know about those Zelda,"" she said in a stupid baby voice, ""Maybe you can have a piece of one when lunch comes.""

""Is this one of the Nazis you were talking about Zelda?"" I asked loudly. ""I drove these all the way up here from Illinois. You'd think they'd let you have them whenever you wanted, like you were an adult."" I don't know what the staff member did, because I couldn't look her in the face. She left.

Zelda ate one on the spot. She wasn't the type to smile or even say thank you. She just told me she hadn't had one in years and that chocolate is her favorite flavor. On our way out to smoke, she replied to a staff member who asked where we were going, ""My buddy is have a smoke with me.""

I'm more proud of standing up for Zelda than anything I've ever done. Fucking Nazis.

He was stuck inside my living room  (only later could i tell he was a male by the cooing and by the formations on his toes) trying unsuccessfully to fly thru the closed half of the glass door. I quickly grabed him between my hands as to prevent any damage to himself and or my furniture. It was then that he looked into my eyes and for a split second i was able to understand his fear, pain and confusion, I tried to pet his head softly as to slow down his heartbeat witch was palpitating as a drum only to release him into the skies. As i opened my hands he doubted me for a second almost not sure that he was going to be released but then he grew with determination and gracefully flew away.

This really made me think, It was valentines day and I had never been so touched by an animal (or a stranger) before. I connected with this pigeon more than I do with my friends or girlfriend most of the time, and it really made me think. 

Why are we so alone when we are surrounded by people constantly crashing into our affairs? Starting today i will treat everyone at work, at college and in general the same way i treated that pigeon. I will extend my hand and help whoever i can in which ever way i can because I know that in the end i wont be alone anymore.

Just about every NSFW subreddit is getting slammed with spam posts that link to viruses and malware. These posts are peppered with some domains that have content just to throw you off. Over the past two days I have reported hundreds of sock accounts to /r/reportthespammers. 

For the most part we are getting almost no response. So the sock accounts are now submitting other domains. Here is what I asking for help on. 

Install Reddit Enhancement Suite. Go into the settings / filters / spam button and turn on (You should see a blue on button when done). When you are done refresh reddit. You will see next to any submission the letters rts. This is a quick feed to reporting a spammer. If you see spam click on the rts. It will open a separate tab in /r/reportthespammers. If it has not been submitted click save at the bottom. 

If it has been submitted (less than seven days ago) upvote it. 

If it has been submitted seven or more days ago click on the submit it again near the top. Put in it that this is a 2nd report. and you have to type in below that this needs to go to the reportthespammers subreddit. 

Message the admins. 

Go to messages /compose. Sent it to /r/reddit.com subject spam attack. Let them know you have been reporting spammers who are not getting shadow banned. reportthespammers treats porn spam like it doesn't exist. So we need to let the admins know. 

Keep it short and simple. 

So you know currently we have been getting spammed by the following domians. 

bibleofporn.com

notanotherporntube.com

pointerweb.biz

scrolltube.info

mybabes.biz

letmeseeya.com

They will include some images from imgur. The sock accounts usually have no comments. Most are less than a month old but we are getting some that are almost three months old. Many that have been previously reported. 

If you see any submissions like this even if they are not in your subreddit please report the post. If you can let the other mods know what is going on. If you want to see please click on my profile and see what I have been doing with my weekend. You can also go to reportthespammers and click on new and see how much I have lit that place up. 

What would be really helpful is a way to add a couple of hundred names to the ban list vis css in one shot so we can just ban these assholes. That way they don't even have the privilege of showing up in the spam section. Any ideas on that? 

Sincerely,

Brendhan

The fact you are just here right now is already enough. I just needed to put this down on words.**

 It hit me earlier that most people on the world, no matter how stupid, bad or selfish they are, have managed at some point to convince a member of the opposite sex (or same in some cases) to engage in a relationship, or even just sex, a lot even multiple times. As someone who has managed to do neither, despite trying my hardest during most of my life, I can't really understand how they do it. 

 I just cant establish deep connections with other people, never really could. Something just doesn't tick right. I don't have a problem talking with other people, I can even be a pleasant company which allowed me to make some friends. But I can't get past that. I can't go past the ""let's talk and be friendly every time we meet"" phase to deeper connections. The close friends I have all came to me by their own initiative. But even with them I can see im different. Sometimes when we go out in large numbers, when it gets too big for all to be a part of the same conversation and smaller groups form up, I will often find myself alone unable to connect and share interests with the people around me, while everyone else just naturally flock together.

 I would like to be able to explain better the difference but I can't since I dont undesrtand it myself. This was very obvious to me everytime I would get into something new with other people. The first few days when no one knew each other I would be in equal footing with everyone else and you would perhaps even take me for someone like them. I would be able to talk and get to know everybody, and this would continue for the next days, but while I would be stuck at this people would start forming groups and deeper friendships with each other.

 Im just so disconnected from them, feels kinda numb. I can mimic their behavior, say what they want to hear, but I don't really understand what moves them. When it comes to establishing a deep relationship with a woman this becomes too evident. I try to act differently but it doesn't comes natural and I guess people can tell.",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_ywmdf,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ywmdf/that_sudden_moment_when_you_realize_just_how/,

We were young and had a big family fast. The first 8 years were fantastic. Then it happened. She kissed another guy. This destroyed the perfect image I had of her. I never fully trusted her again after that. Coupled with my jealousy and anger issues when we fought, bombs went off. Not to say I am all innocent. Fault was in both sides. I'm not sure if it was all sub-conscience, just a lulling affect of being with the same person for so long or a combination of both, but I stopped doing the little things she asked or wanted me to do. Sure I hugged and kissed her everyday and sex was regular. She wanted more. She wanted to hold hands, didn't do it. She wanted to just cuddle, didn't do it. She wanted me to rub her, didn't do it. She wanted me to stay in the kitchen while she cooked, didn't do it. Little things like that. I always told her she was being over emotional. Sometimes she was, but I said it anytime she told me how she felt. So she just stopped telling me. She said she feels numb inside.

Don't get me wrong Reddit, this woman is the love of my life. I just never made the connection because all I needed was the hug, kiss and I love you. We had a bad last couple of months and are now separated. I hope I can salvage what I did to this amazing woman. I turned a loving, caring, happy woman into an empty shell. 

This is just a warning to heed. When she talks, listen. If you cherish her love, then do not ignore her. Woman need extra TLC. Each one is unique, but the little things are just as important to them.

http://imgur.com/Gou8MPr




I grabbed 6,031 comments, of which 5,925 were not duplicates. From those, I could grab the ages of 5,042 Redditors (85.1%). 



The average age of a Redditor is 23.03 years, median 22. The standard deviation is 6.99 years. 12.75% of people in the thread were over 30. 10.20% of comments by peopled ages 22 to 36 contained the words: 'son', 'daughter', 'child(ren)', 'pregnant', or 'baby'. 6.84% of ages 14 to 28 spoke about their 'girlfriend' or 'boyfriend'. The longest comment was 962 words, the shortest was 1 word.

I was about 45 minutes into my 2.5 hour drive back to my apartment from my girlfriend's house and an emotionally troubled deer threw itself in front of my car.  Unfortunately, the suicide attempt was successful.  Mind you, despite being 25, the largest thing I have ever hit in my car, not counting a tennis ball, was a large butterfly.  Needless to say, I was freaked out.  I called my mom, as I do when I need advice in situations I am unfamiliar with, and she recommended me calling 911 to report that this had happened, that I was on the side of the road, and so I could file an accident report for my insurance company.  
I did, and about 15 minutes later the trooper pulled up behind me and asked if I was ok.  I was, so he and I got out of my car and he helped me do a quick damage assessment.  My car, we deemed, was inoperable.  It was leaking copious amounts of radiator fluid.  I called for a tow truck to tow me about 20 minutes the opposite way into the town my parent's live in, and the trooper stayed parked behind me until the truck came.  
I expected the trooper to be upset that he had to help yet another kid who hit yet another deer, but he was very kind and helpful, shook my hand when we parted ways, and we both wished each other a safe night.  
I just wanted to share a positive police interaction story.  I still don't trust 90% of them, especially here in Illinois where we cannot legally record them, but I was thankful that this gentleman lived up to the ""protect and serve"" motto.

Most of the videos I've seen on /r/cringe are videos that people made while just having fun, but after the Internet Hate Machine^TM gets a hold of it their videos get disliked and their comments fill up with how much they suck. We've seen this sort of shit time and again, like last year when Rebecca Black became the target of bullying and even death threats just for making a fun music video. Granted it wasn't a good tune but it doesn't mean she should have gotten tortured for it.

I guess I'm just rambling but it is disappointing to see that people who just want to share something they made with the world get bullied into submission because the internet thinks that they're not worthy of using up precious internet real estate. The larger issue here is obviously internet bullying, which I think is largely due to the anonymous nature of the internet. I'm not trying to save the world and stop bullying, it's going to happen regardless, but it does make me sad that you can be hated for doing just about anything online.

I've linked videos I've uploaded to YouTube on here before and while I don't expect them to get popular I also hope someone doesn't decide that I need to die for having made a video. I just like sharing what I make.

I guess It was a combination of exhaustion from the workout, a full stomach and me and my Fiance deep in convo that I wasn't paying as much attention as I should of backing out of my parking spot...

I winged a parked minivan opposite of me, I felt like such an idiot as anyone would backing into a parked car @ 1mph. I just froze in shock for a few moments that I was so careless.

I awkwardly pull back into my spot to assess the damage: [a thin scrape of paint missing on his bumper,](http://i.imgur.com/u0djt.jpg)[and a minor scuff on mine.](http://imgur.com/nFGt0)

After assessing the damage, I wait for half an hour to see if the owner would return so I could apologize/give insurance info/grovel as needed. The owner doesn't show, so I go to some of the local shops (strip mall) and ask if the staff can ask around, which they did much to my gratitude. All in all the owner doesn't show up.

I didn't wanna be a douche and drive off with just leaving a phone number. So I called my insurance provider, gave all the appropriate information and setup a claim # over the phone, then wrote out a lengthy letter of apology with the insurance info, claim # and my contact information included. All he or she had to do was go to a body shop OK'd by my insurance, and they'd take care of it from there.

It was the best I could do short of waiting there for a couple of hours waiting to break the bad news, so I leave feeling like a dick.

I spent the next hour anticipating a rage-filled phone call promising insults and belittling, and I felt I deserved it. then the phone rang...

Turns out the owner was an elderly man (now I feel worse) but from his tone you wouldn't think someone just rammed his car. He was so ecstatic that I manned up and did the right thing that I ""made his day!"", goes on to say how happy that it made him to see the letter. He wasn't even concerned with the damage, ""No worries, I'll take care of that whenever"". You can imagine my relief.

This won't be that long, I would just like to make sure someone besides me knew.
My mom and dad separated about 5 months ago, on the day after Christmas. It was sort of expected, because things between them had not been exactly right for as long as I remembered. It was still a shock to me initially though, and by the end of winter break, my mom was out of the state. My dad took it hard. I think he loved my mom, but he was so committed to his job I think that he put her on the back-burner. I used to really resent him for that. I thought it was all for personal gain. I didn't think he understood me or my sister or my mom. There were always fights, and I hated even overhearing the screaming. I just got back from the end of my freshman year of college today. My dad met me, and he looked older, but he still greeted me enthusiastically and drove me home. We had a great dinner, steak and potatoes, and we sat and talked about a bunch of stuff for over an hour. As I was walking to my room, my dad told me he was going to bed, and told me that he loved me and hoped I had a good nights sleep. I wished him the same. He then walked over to my sisters room, knocked on the door, and said goodnight. She hasn't lived at home for 3 years. 
I'm literally bawling. I cannot believe that I thought that he was so selfish when really everything he did was for us. He's paying for my ENTIRE college education. He lives alone, working 12 hours a day, with only a grouchy cat for company. He is only 55. I feel like a god damn jackass for everything I said about him when I was younger. I feel like a prick for being so annoyed when he texted me every Sunday night at school, ""just checking in!"".
This is probably just a mess of text, but it actually was kind of cathartic, even if I can barely read it. I havn't cried since my mom told me she was leaving.
I'm sorry Dad. I'll be a better person. Thanks.

Edit: Wow, I really didn't expect this to really take off haha. Thank you all for your kind words, I think I will figure out a way to show him this. Probably a letter or something.

I have a loving boyfriend, amazing friends, and everything I could have ever wanted.  It started when I joined a sorority and made an amazing group of friends who opened doors to a lot of great opportunities for me.  First I signed up to volunteer as a peer councilor at my school Sexual harassment and rape prevention program, which I start this fall.
After some hard work I managed to bring my GPA up from a 2.5 to a 3.2 in just one semester.   
Then when my mom lost her job it threatened my ability to go to school but our family stepped in to co-sign my loans to ensure I could continue. Then my phone broke and it was an expense I couldn't afford to get a new one, but around the same time my boyfriend upgraded to the iphone 5 so he gave me his i phone 4. 
Next I had work study but most of the jobs required me getting a car, again an expense I thought I couldn't afford but it turned out that I actually have been smart about building credit and my score is good enough for me  to get an auto loan without a co-signer. 
Then when my grandparents found out that I would need a car they decided that they would get a new car and give me their old one as a gift. So now I have a safe reliable car with no payments to worry about and the insurance will be cheaper since its older.
After that I just had to find a job, not only did I find one but I got the one I wanted. I'll be working at a youth center for low income children in public housing.  I'll be a tutor and mentor at the after school program, helping the kids with their homework, leading them in sports and arts and crafts projects.  3 hours a day 3 days a week and a set schedule, and the timing is such where it will never interfere with classes, or my volunteer work, or my sorority commitments.   
Oh and my mom is quite close to getting her dream job as well.

All I can say is I'm glad that I didn't let all the negative things that happened to me in my first year and a half of college beat me because now I'm happier than I could ever imagined myself.

I said I would do a follow-up, so here it is. 

I did tell her that night that I knew.  She more or less dug-in her heels.   While she did curtail contact with the guy…our relationship was in a tail-spin -- we were still connected but crashing.  Since she was at home, pregnant with our child, we felt stuck.   We more or less agreed to put our relationship in stasis until after our daughter was born.   My sister was getting married that summer so I requested nothing happen publically until after, which she agreed to.   I know that the guy had cut off contact with her, so she was stuck.  I, on the other hand, vowed to still try to work on saving the marriage, I took that vow explicitly right?   Deep down, I knew this was doomed to failure; however I felt that I needed to see this thru so that in the aftermath I could say I had no regrets.  We got thru the birth, wedding, and figuring out how to raise two kids.

In September, she did re-establish contact with the guy.   Shortly, there after she told me he was something she needed to explore.  I said, uh, you can’t do that, we’re married.  I knew I was throwing the gauntlet down at that point.  And it was then the marriage was over.

We started taking turns living at our house.  She was still a stay-at-home mom, and I worked.  The kids stayed there while we would take turns sleeping there.   I would crash at my parents or a friend’s house.     We planned on getting a separation, then divorce when she resumed teaching and had income again to live on her own.  But the advice were given was that since we were operating in a civil manner, just stick it out and do a divorce when you want to.  So that’s what we did. 

She moved out in October 2011.  We split the kids 50/50, doing the transitions thru school days.   We started the divorce paperwork, intending to do it ourselves.  But having kids complicates the process and we were in over our heads.  So we went to a mediator.  The mediator was expensive, but not as expensive as lawyers.  However neither of us was happy with the progress the mediator was making – having us do this pointless budget exercises – so we put the divorce on hiatus.    We did some of it, namely the parenting plan, on our own.  But really, we just got busy with our own lives.    As the year was ending, I really didn’t want this to bleed into the New Year, so made the push to get the paperwork done today.  And it has.

It’s funny re-reading the things I wrote in my first AMA.   I didn’t fully grasp how long and deep the affair had gone on…far longer than I expected.  I underestimated how much damage had already been done.  Many things I didn’t know.  I was pretty naïve.  My biggest regret is how long I helped drag it out. However, given the same choice again, I wouldn’t change my attitude.  

As for the kids, well, the “advantage” to this is that since they are so young, they really don’t know any different.   I believe they are coping as best as could be hoped.    Birthdays with both families are awkward but oh well.  My parents often help when I have the kids, so they are developing a strong relationship with them.   On the other hand, they now hang out with that guy as well, which as whole, was the hardest part of all for me.   But there isn’t anything I can do about that.  They are safe and happy, so I’m thankful for that.

As for me…2011 was a basically a lost year for me.  I really can’t tell you much, since nothing really much happened for me.  I dove in my work, to which I was eternally grateful.  My work life was great, and I hung on to that for support.  I was rewarded with a huge promotion so that was good.  

2012 is a different story.  I have hard time recalling a year where I’ve more fun in my life.   I made a key new friend and with that opened up a new world for me.  I look better, dress better, have more fun, go all out to parties when I’m not dad.  Stay out late.  Spent time with some beautiful women.  The outlook for 2013 looks very good, and I’m eager to get started.

I’m sure I’ve forgotten a lot of stuff, but I’m tired of writing.  AMA if you like.

Edit 1:  Okay, I remember one thing I wanted to say:  I got a lot of advice to the effect of: ""Be happy with yourself before you look to get into another relationship.""  I remember thinking how stupid that sounded.  But they were right.  I'm almost to the point where being in a relationship would cramp my style hanging out with all my new friends :).",,False,,t5_2qh96,1357000717.0,,,True,t3_15qs2s,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/15qs2s/two_years_ago_i_posted_an_ama_about_finding_out/,

This girl...Ally, for all intents and purposes was thrown into my room by my apartment mate.  She was too drunk to make it home, and I've got a couch that inevitably becomes the resting place for sad, wasted girls that need a safe place to stay.

What makes Ally special is that she was beyond wasted.  And after dealing with her puking on herself, my couch, pillow, blanket, and countless other belongings of mine, she finally passed out.  Relieved from the chaos that broke up my nice evening of web surfing, I retire to my bed for a peaceful slumber.

Yet Ally had different plans...

I wake up an hour later to a huge crash, and through the fuzzy haze of darkness, I see her scrambling to sit back in a chair.  I get up, make my way toward her, put my hand on her shoulder and realize her pants are around her ankles.  She looks up and smiles at me like she's got some wonderful secret that she's going to let me in on.
Apparently that secret is, my chair moonlights as a very ineffective toilet.  
In a groggy, frantic daze, I scramble to throw all of my towels under the chair to catch the two minutes worth of pee flowing from her; my efforts really only directed at protecting my N64 from her yellow puddle.  She finishes, I towel her off, (trying not to gag at the rancid smell of vodka piss) and then pick up the tissues that are on the ground.  
As if all of this wasn't enough, the vomit and the piss, that is...she adds one little extra kick in the nuts.
The tissues I so casually picked up?  Turns out they were actually used as a makeshift Macgyver pad, and I did not realize this till my hands were very much contaminated with dried up period blood.

Yaay for meeting new people! 




EDIT*  I suppose ""makeshift Macgyver pad"" was a bit redundant.  In retrospect, maybe something like, ""she Macgyvered a pad out of tissues"" would have been more appropriate.

1295339061.0,349,self.self,f4bol,I was stalked by a mountain lion for slightly more than an hour today.,grand_poobah,588,239,369,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/f4bol/i_was_stalked_by_a_mountain_lion_for_slightly/,"I was hiking alone up a wash in a somewhat remote part of southern Utah; a somewhat remote part of southern Utah within five miles of a lion I'd seen from my car two days previous (brilliant, I know).  There was no one else in the area and no other cars at the trailhead.  I was about 2 miles into BLM land when I heard rocks shifting and falling from above the 15-foot right side of the wash, maybe 100 feet ahead of me.  I froze, and looked up, and didn't see a thing among the slickrock and brush.  I bared my teeth, and remained planted, and hunched my shoulders aggressively.  Mace in one hand, knife in the other, I stopped, and listened, and growled.  What the hell sort of noise do you make when you're pretending to be vicious?  

I waited, and listened, and waited some more.  After a few moments, more rocks fell from above.  I could hear that whatever it was, it was definitely large, and it was definitely moving in my direction.  It was definitely not a deer.

I felt a very novel, very distinct sensation that I was being hunted.  

Lions like to perch on the high ground and ambush their prey by dropping down on them, snapping their necks.  Without deliberation, I found myself being proactive.  I climbed up the side of the wash and hoisted myself onto a large rock, knife and mace still in hand.  I put on my jacket - a pitiful defense against a mauling, but better than bare skin - and scanned the brush.  I crowed, hurling threats full of hot air through bared canines.  

I still couldn't see anything moving, and wondered if paranoia had gotten the better of me.  But if I was being stalked, going back into the wash was a terrible idea; it would concede the high ground and box me in (not that running would be a viable option anyway).  I needed to move; snarling one last slur about the creature's mother, I got down from the rock and strode - boldly, I hoped - across the shallowest part of the wash and up a steep embankment, to the tallest point in range.  I cast furtive glances behind me, but tried to make my fearful vigilance look like aggressive vigilance instead. 

At the top, I turned around to use my new vantage point.  Crouched low, in the trees behind my former perch, was the lion.  It was watching me, watching it, watching me.  I pretended to mock it, told it I was meaner than it was, and picked up a rock and hurled it with great force onto a boulder - the resultant *crack* resonated pleasingly.  The lion just watched me.  Eventually, I had to start back toward the trailhead; if the sun went down and I was still out there...  

I hiked back buzzing from head to toe, convincing myself to interpret this as aggression instead of fear to keep my haughty posture convincing.  I stayed high up as much as possible, and held my knife, blade-out, in a defensive position by my throat.  I probably stepped on cryptobiotic soil, much to what would usually be my tree-hugging dismay.   I could hear footsteps following me, but the cat kept out of sight.  About an hour later, I approached the road.  I never would have thought that the sound of cars would fill my heart with such profound relief.

tl;dr: Chick goes on a day hike alone in the backcountry, is stalked by a mountain lion, insults its mother, and emerges unscathed.  But shaky.  Very shaky.  

I'm posting this here because if I tell my friends or family they'll freak the fuck out and get all upset that I'm out hiking alone.  Lesson learned, the dispassionate nature of nature, etc. etc.

Here is the story...,myns23,450,104,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1iwmwz/yesterday_a_kid_tried_to_commit_suicide_by/,"I was driving home from work and was just getting onto the on ramp when I noticed a guy walking up it. I was changing my music at the time and wasn't paying too much attention. I notice out of the corner of my eye he starts moving toward my car and I start hitting the breaks. I am moving as far away from him as I can and he is obviously trying to get hit. I hit him at about 20 mph and am to say the least startled. I watch him lay on the ground for about a minute then he opens his eyes and gets up and walks to the side of my car.


""What the hell was that."" 
""I don't know man.""
 ""Are you okay""
 ""I don't know""

At this point I'm looking at him to make sure he is not hurt and he appears fine. No blood or any marks on his body. He didn't struggle to move around. I am assuming at this point it is one of those insurance frauds I have seen on here and am not sure whether I should drive away or call the cops.

""Honestly man what was that.""
""I don't know, I guess I was trying to kill myself.""

At this point I'm thinking he probably needs someone to talk too and I can't just drive off. I want to call the cops but I don't know if that will help this kid.

""Do you need someone to talk to want to grab some food or something."" ""I don't know, well yeah that would be nice I guess.""

I look him up and down and hes not a grungy kid he is pretty cleaned up and doesn't look like he has anything on him. I tell him to get in my car and try to talk with him. I asked him what's going on and why he is doing this. He doesn't give much of a reply. Just says he doesn't know I continue to try to see what he is interested in and what he likes about life. Apparently he was 23 years old and has aspergers. He also tells me how he is just messed up. I am making a point to kinda watch him in case he flips out and I have to keep him back or do something. He seems to be acting normal except for some minor things like eye contact.

I get to the center of town and ask him where he wants to go. I explain he needs some help and who can I take him to to get some help. We discuss the hospital and the police and he says he just wants to sit down. He says let go to this restaurant which was a pud (I really wish I had thought it through and not brought him there.)

I notice when we get out that my car has minor damage and I'm kinda pissed but I am not going to lay into the kid.

I also realize this is a fucked up situation and I probably shouldn't be doing this but I don't know what to do. I am also in a lot of shock which is messing with me.

When we get in the pud apparently the bartender knows him and asks if he is doing alright. He mumbles something to her. I realize I need to talk to this girl to get someone who knows him here to help him out. We get a beer and I keep talking to him to see what's up and how he feels right now about everything. His responses are short and doesn't seem to trying to communicate. I tell him we need to get him some help and I need to talk to someone and he just kinda ignores it. He says he has a therapist and I have him call him but no one answers. I go up the bar to get a refill and tell the girl that I need to talk to her and this kid needs someone here to help him. She nods as he runs up behind us to ask what we are talking about. I said I was getting another beer. 

Sometime passes and a little more banter while I try to tell him that life can get better but you have to want it to get better and continue to work on yourself. Eventually the girl comes over and says why don't we all talk outside. Apparently he told her that he tried killing himself by jumping in front of my car when he was getting a beer. We start to talk to him about what his options are and what we are going to do. He talks about calling his dad and we mention the police. He has attempted this kind of thing before and has been in and out of the insane asylum and other psychological centers.

We go back inside well he thinks about what he is going to do. The girl explains she is going to call one of her police officer friends and have him come by. I agree thats a good choice. I wait around for about 20 minutes and she looks at me and say I can get going if I want she will take care of it. I was torn between leaving but I wasn't sure if I could be of anymore help. She seemed like she could do more for him and take care of him better than I could. I wish the kid luck and than tell him it will be okay. As I step outside I see a cop car and am so relieved I speak to the officer about the incident. He get my information and proceeds to go inside. I wait a few minutes and they walk out with. I tell him that he'll get the help he needs and be better soon. I drive home.



TL:DR - a kid with aspergers jumped in front of my car trying to kill himself and wasn't hurt. I took him to a place (pub) to talk and relax. Met someone he knew in the bar and she called the cops.


Okay first off sorry about spelling ect just trying get this off my chest. I don't think I made the best decisions, I should have just called the cops right away. I assume I didn't because I didn't think they would necessary help him (not that I could.) Taking him to a pub was a poor choice but I was in shock and not sure how to handle the situation I though it might help him relax. I am still struggling with this and I have felt really weird since the incident. I wrote this on here to tell you a story and thought you guys might be able to give myself and other some advice on how to handle things.

The rest of this post is quite intentionally uncensored.)*

**My First Racism: Or, ""Fucking Nigger,"" Cry of the Red Baron**

To be clear, I've faced a number of seemingly-racist situations before, but most of them fit pretty reasonably into alternate explanations. I've experienced a few typical getting-stopped-by-the-cops-for-no-apparent-reason experiences, a few unusually harsh punishments in mostly-white schools, and many ""You're not like other black people!"" moments. But nothing like, say, a hate crime, blatant discrimination, or the usage of a racial slur with earnest, racism-fueled anger.

That said, yesterday was overall weird for me. It involved, among other things, a few new ways to conceptualize my dysfunctionality/cognitive distortions/procrastination; talking face-to-face with one of the original radical feminists; and experiencing some psycho-physiological triggers that sent me into a mental haze of agitation, frustation, and disjointed thought processes. The weirdest part, however, came after all that (technically this morning).

----------

So I'm sitting in my living/dining room/kitchen/hallway, in the aforementioned state of agitation, heightened by my inability to type as fast as my brain is running. The craving for comfort food that's been nagging at my mind all day returns again, and I decide to cave in. I bike furiously to a nearby 24-hour Mexican food place, leave my bike just past one side of the door, and walk in.

I only notice one other customer as I walk in, to whom I pay little attention. Spotting one working employee (which makes sense, considering it's ~12:30am), I stand a few feet away from the counter, scanning the menu for something that'll put me in a nice food coma. A worker comes out from the back and steps to the counter, stares at me with unmitigated exhaustion and disinterest for a few seconds, decides I'm not going fast enough, and returns to someplace beyond view. My heart is warmed.

I'm just zeroing in on my preferred choice of coping-feed when, from some vague area behind me, I hear the words: ""Fucking nigger.""

I feel myself tense up a bit—my right temple twitching slightly, my shoulderblades crunching into the base of my neck, my chest filling with a flash of rage-heat like an oven had just been opened and immediately closed in my gut—for just a fraction of a second. I realize just how acutely aware I am of my state of agitation, since these feelings are all so slight. My reaction is, perhaps, as much a response to the vitriol with which the words were half-spat, half-mumbled as it is to the words themselves. Ultimately, however, this gut response is fleeting, and I don't see it as a big deal. 'Just like on the internet,' I surmise. 'It doesn't matter.'

Without so much as a glance towards the other customer, I decide on a burro &amp; enchilada combo and walk up to the counter, waiting for the previous server to return.

""Fucking nigger,"" I hear, a bit louder this time. It may as well be text on a screen; I feel no reaction. My self-imposed desensitization holds strong. The tired employee returns, and I get to orderi—""fucking nigger."" Tired employee guy glances at the patron (maintaining his gaze of zero-level interest), then back to me. I finish the order; he gets to work.

On my way back—""fucking nigger""—to my seat, I decide to intently observe my co-patron. He appears to be an older white man, but not too well-off (based on his clothes and overall appearance). I would presume that—""fucking nigger""—he's homeless if it weren't for the keys connected to the handle of his cane (though they could have gone to a vehicle, or nothing important/valuable at all). He's just—""fucking nigger""—gotten into his bright-metallic-red scooter, and is now struggling to put his left sandal back on with the use of his cane and left hand. He looks up at me a few times while he struggles to put on his sandal for—""fucking nigger""—about 3 minutes, but never speaks while looking at me. My—""fucking nigger""—gaze remains constant.

""Fucking nigger... fucking nigger... fucking niggers... fuck them niggers... fuck them niggers... "" I idly ponder whether he has Tourrette syndrome, or some other psychological issue that would explain this. (Y'know, besides racism.)

The guy seems a bit frustrated by his footwear ordeal, and understandably so. I indulge in a bit of sick joy, chuckling the 6th or 7th time his sandal falls off his scooter and he has to start all over again. I realize that, since I'm sitting right next to the door, he'll have to pass pretty close by me to get out. My mind offers up a few fucked up things to do if he physically engages me, the cruelest being to simply take his cane and toss it out into the parking lot (you can see how very violent I am). Tired-bored-underpaid is soon standing at the counter with my food, so I walk over again.

After thanking the red-eyed burro-roller, I turn to the other patron and say, ""Would you like some help?""  

He responds, ""Are you gonna arrest me?""  

I didn't quite hear him, and I didn't think he quite heard me, so I reiterated:  

""I said, 'Would you like some help?' I noticed you were having trouble with your shoe...""  

""Are you gonna arrest me?""  

I hear him clearly this time. I chuckle.  

""Do I look like a cop? No, of course not.""  

""Then get the hell away from me.""  

This makes me laugh again, and I return to my seat. 'No problem,' I think. I begin scarfing down my comfort food, as intended, while watching this crotchety fellow continue to fail to put on his sandal. He eventually succeeds, and I think grabs his leftovers; I'm unsure because I'm much more interested in my meal at this point. During this time I hear a barely-audible string of mumbled words, distinguishing only something to the effect of 'I oughtta rough you up,' and, of course, one more ""fucking nigger"" for good measure. After that, the guy is silent.

A few moments pass and my mind's already focused on the night's earlier agitating experiences, so I'm only keeping a low-grade, paranoia-fueled sliver of attention on the Red Baron by the time his tedious, pathetically arduous preparation is complete. As he begins to silently scoot his way out of the restaurant, I contemplate maybe giving him a nice message on the way out, my frustrated mind failing to conjure anything more fun or interesting (nor, ironically, anything angrier) to do.

Just as he passes me, I muster up the secretarian cheer to leave him with the words, ""Have a wonderful evening."" He doesn't respond (how boring). I listen to him spend the better part of a minute maneuvering around the door outside (in writing this, I realize this may have been because my bike was blocking him from going the other way), followed by a soft *crack*, and then nothing else.

...

After a few minutes, I decide to stop eating, take a few more binge-bites, and pack up my food. I notice a broken styrofoam container and some spilled food on the sidewalk as I leave. 'How sad,' I think. Then I strap my leftovers to my bike and head home.

----------

And that, whites and blacks, is the story of My First Racism.

----------

**Edit**


**tl;dr:**  
I was frustrated and hungry. Also, black. It was ~12am so I biked like a madman to a 24-hr Mexican food place. The only other customer there was an older, homeless-looking white guy. While looking at the menu, I heard him say ""fucking nigger"". I had a mild gut reaction, but didn't respond. I then heard ""fucking nigger"" said repeatedly throughout the process of choosing, ordering, and waiting for my food. I had no more reaction, and didn't respond.

While waiting, I recognized the guy was probably mentally ill, had gotten into a motor scooter, and was repeatedly failing to put his sandal back on. When I walked up to get my food, I asked if he wanted some help; he asked if I was going to arrest him; I lol'd and said no; he said to get the fuck away from him. I sat down by the door and started eating.

On his way out the door, I said ""Have a wonderful evening."" I finished eating and went home.

My daughter (9) has none of that. Not one bit. I live in Oakland. I've seen used needles in the creek near our house where she and I have explored together. I'm not super exited about sending here there alone.

I sent her with a friend (who is 8) 6 blocks to the store to buy themselves popsicles. I was told in no uncertain terms by the mom's friend ""if she is with you, never let my daughter out of your sight again.""

**UPDATE 18 (Sunday)**  I'm sorry once again for not being able to update this for as long as I wanted to; power went out here.  There has been a confirmed number (thus far) of 5 fatalities, most of which come from Hideaway Parl/Tangere Park Area, and two children.  ~~Hundreds of~~ 20 injuries, some people are still missing.  There are multiple counties joining in the search and rescue for the people of Woodward.  The tornado sirens did not go off due to the storm approaching too quickly, along with a malfunction (lightning strike).  Police and other emergency officials have mentioned to keep calling relatives/friends there to a minimum due to it jamming their lines, so TEXTING would be the next best thing.  I know I'd probably try a few more times before giving it a break.  I hope that everyone else is okay, and if I weren't so far away, I know I'd be right there with the search and rescue teams helping them.  Donations are also being accepted, take any donations to the Living Word Fellowship Church.  They are also looking for any help they anyone can provide.  Thanks again y'all, Woodward needs all the help they can get right now.

I believe that I have, indeed, been placed on Academic Performance Contract in error.

It feels so unbelievably amazing to just say ""fuck off"" to all of those feelings of anger, frustration, helplessness and resent. And, I know I won't be easy to replace.

This winter of daytime television and CoDMW2, is being sponsored by my amazing woman. She makes big bucks, and didn't mind helping me tell them just where they could fucking shove it.

To all you miserable bastards out there, working a 9-5 grind that the economy has you chained to - your time will come too.

And in the mean time: naner naner naner.

Edit: I was perfectly content to let the job give me an ulcer, and quietly kill me. She's been pushing me to quit for many weeks, and finally demanded that I quit. We've carefully done our budget, and we will have no problem remaining solvent throughout my job search.

All of a sudden there was a loud bang, and my eyes opened wide.  Then another bang, and I immediately recognized it as gun shots.  Before the third round got fired I rolled off the bed and started crawling across my apartment to my daughter's room to make sure she was fine.  I saw my wife moving out of the corner of my eye, so I assumed she was awake and getting down.

About another 7 shots went off before they stopped.  I waited a minute and then checked out the window to see if I could see anything, but didn't.  I then went back into my bedroom only to find my wife snoring...and I thought I slept hard.  By this time, maybe 2-3 minutes after gun shots happened, I heard people outside arguing.  I immediately grabbed my wife's cell phone and called 911.

That was about an hour and a half ago...those people were still outside arguing till about 10 minutes ago when 1 of them left.  There's still no sign of the police.  Wtf?  Seriously?  What has to happen in order for the police to show up, bombing of a Shipley's?

There's always police in this neighborhood and they're always more than willing to pull you over for doing 2mph over the speed limit, but when you actually need them they don't respond.  This just pisses me off and I seriously hope there's no one laying in their apartment bleeding to death right now.

Maybe some of you won't make the same mistake I did.

There was this girl from back home who I had known since high school, but we had never talked much. She was a friend of a friend, so we would see each other here and there, but not very often. After graduating high school and going off to college, I didn't see her for a few years and honestly forgot she existed. A few months ago, we met at a party back home with some old high school friends. I was shocked to see that she had grown into a gorgeous young woman in the few years since I had seen her. We got pretty drunk that night, made out a little bit, and I ended up partying too hard so she took care of me until I fell asleep.

After that, we started talking on Facebook quite a bit. We went to different schools, so we didn't see each other, but we talked all the time. It turned out that, not only was she gorgeous, but she was also rather intelligent! We agreed on a ton of topics and she seemed to be very passionate about music and life. I wanted to become more than friends, but I was hesitant. I had tried and failed at a long-distance relationship with a different girl from the same school. So I didn't say anything and we stayed just friends.

Earlier today, I got the news that she killed herself. It hasn't really sunk in yet that she is gone. I have never had a close friend die before and this is a strange feeling. I honestly don't know what to think about it. What I do know, however, is that I will never have the chance to tell her what a great person she was. At this point in my life, I know how rare such a woman is. Who knows, maybe if I had been forward with my feelings, it might have given her enough hope to save her life.

If you haven't told somebody that you love how you feel about them, go tell them right now. You may not get another chance.

EDIT: Thanks for all the kind words, everybody. For those of you saying not to blame myself, I don't. Although I still wonder if maybe I could have helped. I'm at work right now, so I'll have to keep this short. I'll get on later and respond to some of your comments.

1375801313.0,335,self.self,1jtbue,I get treated a lot better since losing weight and I kind of hate it,weightlossthrowawayy,457,122,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1jtbue/i_get_treated_a_lot_better_since_losing_weight/,"First, a bit of context: I’m 5""10, female, 18 years old and my weight has gone from 256lbs/18st4lbs/116kg to 184lbs/13st2lbs/83.4kg. My BMI has gone to almost morbidly obese to the lower end of overweight. The time frame for this has been since October last year to now (ongoing)

By my own self perception I’ve gone from lardass to a bit tubby (about 2 stone overweight but I think my height and the fact that all my clothes are a bit big plays it down a bit). I'm currently about one stone (14lbs) away from being in the healthy range but just over two stone (28lbs) to my goal (11stone/154lbs)


One of the biggest things I’ve noticed since losing weight is how people treat me and it’s weird. Before my weight would be pretty much open to scrutiny by anyone- I remember being about six years old and asking my dad for a snack and he just said “what, have you got worms or something? You just ate, your mother isn’t strict enough with you"", family members would drop hints like “you know, I had a friend who managed to lose a lot of weight by just…."", strangers would shout at me from cars, kids would laugh, guys would jokingly say things like “ahh, my mate fancies you!"" etc to the point where I developed social anxiety and didn’t feel good enough to go outside. A PE teacher once sat me down and lectured me on my weight and then told me to pretend I’d hurt my ankle and sent me to sit on the side of the boy’s lesson so I wouldn’t slow the rest of my class down when they went for a run (I wish she could see me now but she moved to Spain and I’ve since left school), a drunk guy at a gig once blocked my path to the loos and said “we’re only letting fit girls through here"". I’ve lost count of the amount of bad experiences I’ve had. People were just rude.

To anyone who's seen My Mad Fat Diary - the scene where Rae has ""jabba"" shouted at her was pretty much what happened to me regularly. 

I just got back from a walk and I saw a group of 3-4 kids on bikes, all about 14 years old. I automatically crossed the street and turned my music up so I wouldn’t hear if they shouted at me but looked out of the corner of my eye expecting to see them laugh but they didn’t and I was so convinced they would. Maybe it’s more an issue of confidence than weight and they were actually nice people that I’d unfairly judged but I shouldn’t have been surprised. It shouldn’t be an expectation for fat people to get harassed in public. Now I'm not trying to justify obesity because it's unhealthy and has literally nothing going for it but fat people are people too.

Another thing is more strangers make eye contact, I get more random smiles, if I step aside to let pass or hold a door I get more thank yous than before and more people let me cross the road. The other day the road was completely clear apart from one car, so he could have kept going and not felt guilty because I’d be able to cross a second later but he stopped. I smiled and nodded as I crossed as a thank you and he smiled back and watched me as I walked across the road and turned his head to watch me walk the pavement alongside his car before driving off. I’m convinced that that’s due to my weight too. Also the way I've been treated in the past makes me feel suspicious when people flirt with me, like their mates have put them up to it for a laugh. It's pathetic that I'm 18 years old and I still haven't had my first kiss but anyway, that's not what this is about. 

It just makes me feel kind of disgusted. I'm sure it's not a conscious thing that people are nicer (see the halo effect) but it just leaves a bad taste.

I hate the phrase ""fat shaming"" but I think it applies to what I've experienced.

Thank you to anyone that actually read this. It feels good to get it off my chest.

Today I am presenting to you the card game I have been working on for the past five years, a game that has slowly evolved from a college project into something real. 

The game is called ""What?!? Oh... The Game of Couples Banter."" Players play cards from their hand to create a ridiculous conversation and then try to catch each other not listening. I mean, it's like real life, right?

Needless to say, I'm scared shitless about putting it out in the world, but I am determined to do it. If you have any free time or if you think the game sounds up your alley, please check out the print and play version below.

Here are the links:

I also sent requests to the FAA, CIA, NSA and a few others. Got some stuff back from the FAA, and the NSA said they never heard of me. Still waiting on the CIA and the rest.


If anybody actually DID have a file and got it back, I would be pretty interested in seeing what a real FBI file looks like!

1298656828.0,337,self.self,fsojg,"I just googled a festival I went to 6 years ago, and found a picture of myself passed out in the mud. This is the time I, was ""that guy"".",,625,288,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/fsojg/i_just_googled_a_festival_i_went_to_6_years_ago/,"Here's the photo: http://www.flickr.com/photos/friedpixphoto/235429853/

The whole weekend was quite a story so I'm going to give a short version to hopefully make some people feel better about their current predicaments. 

I was having a really rough time, living and working in D.C. Very unhappy at the time, working 70-80 hour weeks, and living in an area I absolutely hated. Not to mention girl problems. I was miserable. 

Earlier in the month some friends from pittsburgh mentioned they were going to the All Good Music Festival in West Virginia. I knew I would be too busy, and VERY regrettably declined. My favorite band at the time The Flaming Lips, that i'd never seen before were playing the first show on friday at 9:30, so in order to see them I'd have to leave early, wasn't gonna happen. 

Well, that friday came, and at 6 pm, I freaked out and walked out on the project I was working on and spontaneously decided to drive the 4 hours to west virginia, with no ticket, no extra clothes, no friends, no green...

I arrived at a line of cars to get in around 10:00pm, thinking I might be able to catch the end of the lips. Well, part of the mud road in was actually washed away, taking a few cars with it. So in line I wait, all the while, hearing people saying things like it's a 6 hour line, etc. Slowly moving towards the show by myself, it takes until 2:00am to get to the front gate. 

At this point I was very bummed out abut missing the lips. And multiple times in the line I could hear their songs in the distance. Not to mention the 8 hours I just sat in a car, with no weed. At the front gate, I find a ticket to buy, and get inside, and ask this crazy hippy dude if the lips went on, he was like ""yeah, it was awesome!"" UGGHHH...  Then I asked if he had any smoke, to which he happily smoked me out. I immediately started to feel better, as I realized at least I wouldn't have to work for the next two days.

So I leave him, walk a mile, and climb over a hill to get to the main stage, which by the way is in this huge valley between two mountains, absolutely beautiful. Then I see Wayne Coyne (flaming lips lead singer for those of you that don't know) walk up to the mic, and say ""I think we're about ready to get started!"" I couldn't believe it! They hadn't played yet? Later I learned that some part of the stage broke postponing everything. The hippy must have been.. well, a crazy hippy.. and the music I heard while waiting in line must have been loud car stereos or something. I freaked out!

Half an hour into their set it started down pouring, and it was the most beautiful experience ever, hearing them play the song ""in the morning of the magicians"" in this insane environment (consider the contrast to the cubicle I was used to). I danced with strangers, the entire time, and was probably the happiest I'll ever be. They played past 4:30am, two encores. 

I found my friends, and the next day, after having such an amazing night, nothing mattered. So i did a bunch of drugs and passed out at like 2pm.. it is not a dirt nap. I was out. Some friendly gentleman eventually gave me a small chair to sit in, and fortunately I didn't care about the string cheese incident, so I didn't miss any bands I really liked. Came out of it around 6 and just relaxed the whole rest of the weekend. 

The moral of the story, is that when you think life is horrible, and things are getting you really down. Screw everything, run away and get back to the basics of what makes you happy, and you'll be much better off, even if you look like a fool. 


TL;DR Enjoy your life even if it's embarrassing sometimes :)

I know trolls on the internet are bad, but this isn't 4chan. I would like to be able to have interesting, intelligent, non-sexist discussions on this site. And I can, as long as I don't click on the comments section of any female poster.

I click on a post today titled ""I desgined and made my first dress this week"" I thought the dress was interesting so I went to go put in my two cents critique of the dress (very positive) and wanted to actually have a discussion about this. I was appalled that all of the first 200 highest rated comments were all about how the dress was Photoshopped, and how scooperupper should show pictures of herself naked. Not at all productive or uplifting.

as I try to comment, I get an error message, and after a few minutes I realize she has deleted her account. Now, before, while I was still looking at the dress i had clicked on her info to see if she had submitted other things along this lines. She had been a redditor for 7 months with a moderate comment contribution to r/atheism and some other subreddits. So I know that she wasn't a throw-away account. 

Granted, I DO NOT know why she deleted herself from reddit, I can only speculate it is because of the rampant sexism on this site.

I really think that it is not a breach of free speech for the mods to actually *moderate* in order to promote healthy discussion in subreddits like these.  Post something sexist lets do something like put you on posting probation or even ban you.

Lets still have all the silly things like r/anything goes and r/spacedicks. But I don't get on reddit to look at 4chan, I would like to have some discussions once in a blue moon.

P.S. scooperupper: If you want to know what I thought of your dress PM me, I'd be happy to.

They didn't even have the decency to refund his application fee.  My parents aren't of any help and we don't have the heart to tell them the truth of the matter regarding scholarships. I don't know if this is just him being upset talking but his original plan was to join the marines and he wants a combat role specifically, he wants to go to the recruiter soon about it.

How do you make that kind of mistake, they dangled thirty thousand a year in front of him and made him think that maybe the next four years of his life after high school wouldn't be shit or steeped in mediocrity. I wish I could fix it all.

EDIT: Since I thought it would be best to add more detail. My brother was given an honorable mention in the National Hispanic Recognition Program, he had really good SAT scores, a few weeks later he gets a letter in the mail congratulating him on a 30k a year scholarship to a state university.  It's been a few months since then and just today he gets a call saying that the scholarship reward was a mistake. I know a lot of you want to know the name of the college in question but the next chance I get I'm going to have a discussion with my brother about legal recourse and it may be for the best to keep names out of this for the time being. I assure you if legal recourse fails I will spread the name around and let you all know who did this. My brother deserves better, and I'm not going to sit around and do nothing as long as there's a slim chance of him getting his education.

I'll try to make this as less of a block of text as possible.

Small back story:  I am 30[m], married for almost 5 years, with a 1 year old son.  My wife and her family are very close/best friends with a woman and her daughter and have been for over 20 years.  This woman also had 3 sons, the oldest is the one we are talking about today.  He is in his 40s, three kids from three women, twice divorced.  His most recent divorce was last year, about 6 months after his wife had given birth to his 3rd kid.  Their family is not very... stable.  Relationship wise or mentally wise.  There's more, but I digress...

I live about 20 minutes from him.  His family and my wife's family live about 9-10 hours away (driving).  This weekend, my mother in law and his mother drove down together to visit.  So yesterday the plan was for my wife, my kid, and I to drive to his house to meet him, and come back with MIL.  Before we get in the car, he calls my wife and tells her he doesn't think I should come over, because of something that happened last time he was at our house.  Naturally, she and I are taken back by this and realize the last time he was at our house was in June of last year (right before the divorce).  

Today my wife, MIL, and his mother meet up while I was at home, and finally get her to tell us what supposedly happened.

**So, according to him telling his mother, who told my wife, who told me...**  

&gt;Last June he was at my house visiting with his (then)wife, newborn, and his 5 year old daughter.  She was in the guest bathroom dancing with the door open and I was outside the bathroom crouching down and looking up her skirt.  He walked up, watched me do this for a minute or so, then yelled at me and asked what I was doing.  He then yelled or argued with me, packed up his family, and left.

**Let me be clear here.  None of this is true.**  I remember them coming over (because it was right after my birthday, they had brought me a bottle of liquor).  I somewhat remember showing their daughter where the bathroom was, but then going back to the living room with everyone else.  Then I do kinda remember him leaving in a bit of a hurry, because he said the 5 year old was behaving bad or something.  Honestly I really don't remember much because we're talking about over... 7 months ago this supposedly happened.

Since then, he and my wife have talked a couple times and it was never brought up.  He even watched my kid once when we were desperate for a sitter, I dropped off at his work and we talked for a bit, never seemed like anything was different or weird.  

I've been very angry today since hearing this.  I've never done anything like that, never been accused, suspected... nothing.  I am not attracted to children in any way.  I love kids, I have a handful of nieces and nephews, and of course my own child which I love with all my heart.  I'm trying not to babble, but I hope my position is clear on this.

What I'm trying to ask, is what do I do?  I fully understand that once an accusation gets thrown out like that, it's always going to be on the back of people's minds.  This could be very damaging to my wife and MIL's relationship with their family.  Not to mention, my relationship with my wife, and her family.

**Tl;dr**  I'm accused of looking up a 5 year old's skirt in my house 7 months ago.  It did not happen.  Accuser's family is close friends with wife's family, what should I do to make sure it doesn't affect my marriage and relationship with in-laws?

Yet every flower should also bloom

Never getting the chance to see the sunlight on their soft petals.

When it was supposed to give you life?

And the gardener feels he could have done something,

but what can a man do against a flood?

You were plucked from the ground too early,

washed away by the rains of chance,

carried away with death's ugly ropes.

But I need to get this out there.  I guess I've been very lucky for the first 30 years in life to never have to deal with death.  I literally don't know anyone close to me who has died.

So as I am getting older, so are those around me. Grandparents, parents, aunties, uncles, friends, neighbours. We go through life taking the people around us for granted.  But the fact is, I realised in quite a powerful unsettling dream one night that my parents are getting old. They're going to die!  Then I realised, I too am getting old, and I too am going to die. My childhood and my youth are over. Never again in my life will I get to experience youth and childhood again. Its gone, its finished, its taken, spent. 

I know its natural. But I sometimes think we all just get too absorbed in each day, caring about menial shite ignoring and not caring about the fact that we're all travelling down this conveyor belt of time. I literally looked at the date.. It's 2012!! How the hell did it get to 2012 already?  Time is just ripping us away from everything, and everyone.  Its forcing us on a journey to the end. 

And thats what also bothers me... What happens at the end? We die in one way or another. Is that it? Everything I learned, and, experienced just gone? Erased? My character, my personality, my memories, my very being?  Wiped?  What an awful waste! What is the point in anything!?

It doesn't feel right, it doesn't feel natural to me. There are hopes of some kind of existence after death with many beliefs out there. But no one knows for sure. It is this not knowing which is grating me as well. It seems very understandable how one could fall into a belief system concerning an existence, or non existence after physical death and with that belief system comes a peace of mind on this great question.

But I can't understand how the majority of people go on about their lives not caring about this.  I don't understand how people are quite happy to waste time as well, falling out with loved ones over trivial matters and wasting their own lives.  I think people forget that it doesnt go on forever, and days turn into weeks, weeks turn into months and months turn into years.

I finally thought of the wonderful game of Blind Golf, which is played as follows:

 * Begin by creating a Blind Golf course in pen on a blank sheet of paper. Each hole should look like a mini-golf hole with any number of obstacles.  It must include a Tee Dot (a small dot of ink) and a Hole (an empty circle about the size of a hole punch.

 * To play a hole, place your pen (or pencil if you want to play the same course multiple times) on the Tee Dot, close your eyes, and draw a line (not necessarily straight).

 * Open your eyes. If your line ever crossed a line, you went out of bounds. Draw an X where you ended up, and put your pen or pencil back on the dot you started the shot from.

 * If you didn't go out of bounds, draw another dot at the end of your line, place your pen or pencil on this line, close your eyes, and take another shot.

 * Continue until your line ends in the Hole, at which point you're done. Your score is the number of strokes you took, which can be counted by the number of dots or X's other than the Tee Dot (out of bounds counts as a mulligan, essentially).

Mr. Whiny Butt asked a question, as have several others. I am sending my reply to everyone. And it's going to be blunt.

In 40 years of teaching I have never had so many students so anxious about grades. I understand that you want to get good grades. But this obsession is counterproductive.

I have said several times in class that the key is in YOUR work at pulling out the most important stuff from the lecture outlines I've given you. Mr. Whiny Butt, speaking for a study group, says that I skipped over some saints and highlighted others and, so now, would I please tell you exactly what to study for the exam.

Well, I won't.

I told you early on to, after each class, select 2 or 3 most important points from the class session, using the boldfaced material on the outlines. Take a risk, launch out on your own, do your own summarizing of my summarizing. That's how you learn.

You've been cheated out of a high school education. You've been mommified, taught to jump through hoops, do exactly this and then exactly that. Your teachers have been mommies, not fathers. You've been told do this, do that instead of, okay, you're old enough now, learn to do it yourself.

It's not your fault, but you've been had.

Learn to learn. Learn to take a body of material, analyze it, extract the key points from a list of key points.

The grading system at this university and at all universities is a huge lie. You are all obsessed with getting As. Let me let you in on a huge secret.

If everyone gets all As, A becomes meaningless. Since everyone is getting As and Bs in most universities and only a few get Cs, everyone's grades are meaningless. A and B are now average, not superior.

And employers and grad schools know this. They don't pay attention to GPA, over which you obsess, any more because they know
GPA scores
are
meaningless.

Meaningless.

Meaningless.

Employers and grad schools find other ways to find out whether you are in the top 10% or top 50% or top 70%.

If you learn to learn now, it will not only help you get a meaningless high GPA but
it'
will
help
you
learn skills valuable to an employer: initiative, thinking things out, analyzing to find the main points.

Learn to see the forest. You've been taught only to see the trees.

Did you write down two or three important things after each class session, then review them as they accumulate? If so, you have your review sheet for the exam.

YOU have to choose the two or three most important things for each class session. Because in the choosing of them you evaluate the other things that you didn't choose and you learn something about them as well.

Yes, I could give you lectures in which I highlight three things for that day. You could dutifully write them down and memorize them, get a meaningless A on the exam and learn nothing for the future.

If that's what you want in life, okay. Please send me an email saying that. If 50% of you send me an email like that then I'll give you a sheet with the 30 things that will be on the 2nd exam covering the next three weeks and you don't need to come to class. Heck, I'll just give you the 2nd exam a day ahead of time and you fill it out at home and hand it in. I won't bother to grade it, I'll just give you all As on it.

Everyone will get an A on the exam and only those who actually want to learn something about Catholicism need to come to class from here on out. You all get As for the course and you'll be happy.

Just send me that email.

Some of you already know about how to take initiative and boil a body of material down to its most important points and take that knowledge out of the material. They are the ones who truly should get the As and they would be the one's with the kind of skills employers and med schools are looking for. The others should get Bs and Cs and Ds.

But as it stands, there is no way to identify those who are doing outstanding work, since they are lumped in with those doing good work (B).

Since it was a half-day of school we got out around noon and decided we would go to the park. There wasn't really anyone else around since it midday in the city so it was just us and for some reason there was a girl there standing by herself.

She was a few years older than us but not by that much and I remember she was cute. The was a bit taller than us and had her hair in a bun. She had a jacket and skirt on which was weird because it was cold that day and we all had coats. 

At first we kept trying to figure out if she was waiting on someone or just lost and then one of my friends realized that she might be a prostitute. I don't remember exactly how we went from ""she might be a prostitute"" to ""she's definitely a prostitute"" but we were all set on the idea. We talked for a while trying to figure out why she wasn't in school and why she was doing this (at the time we only thought they did things with people for money but we weren't exactly sure what those things were, the idea that they had sex never crossed our minds). We all eventually came to the idea that we should each give her a dollar so she could go home and get out of the cold. We gathered up 6 dollars and one of my friends walked over to her and gave her the money. She waved at us, we waved back and then we decided to go to the arcade that was a few blocks away.

It wasn't until a few years later that i realized how fucking weird that must of seemed for her.

TL;DR: In the 6th grade my friends and I gave a hooker money so she didn't have to be in the cold.

Last Thursday night I stayed at the LaQuinta Inn on 6030 East Skelly Drive, Tulsa, OK. Friday morning, sometime after 6:00 am, a 16ft Interstate Load Runner trailer I had attached to my SUV was stolen. I was moving from Atlanta to San Francisco, hoping my wife and I could find a job there, we are both geeks. The trailer contained everything we had, all our clothes for me and my 5 kids, their toys, but most importantly, it had irreplaceable family photos. The only picture in existence of my grandfather that was killed in WWII, all the pictures of my father I saved after he died, my wedding pictures, everything.

I lost my business two years ago, and I have been trying to rebuild my life ever since. I have lost my house, and everything else, little by little ever since. I can't really handle the financial hit on this, but the family pics and random things of my fathers I saved are just too much.

My trailer was the third in three nights to be stolen, nobody from the hotel offered me any info about the theft problems they had been experiencing when I checked in. The police officer that took the report told me they have on numerous occasions told the management there to install some video cameras in the parking lot and get a security guard at night, each time the suggestion was ignored.


Im hoping some redditor in the Tulsa will recognize the trailer or know someone that has found a stash of dumped pictures and clothes.

Pics of the trailer are here:

1306041173.0,320,self.self,hh51x,Introversion is not a disorder. It is a personality trait.,panda_vindaloo,445,125,111,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hh51x/introversion_is_not_a_disorder_it_is_a/,"For the sake of context the inspiration for this post comes from a conversation I overheard between two Midwestern women, one of them being the grandmother and legal guardian of a teenager on a trip I went on recently. The teenager spent most of her time on her laptop, chilling out in her cabin. I was passing by and heard the grandmother explaining this to the trip organizer saying, ""She has introversion..."" To which I quipped: ""Really? I have introversion, too.""
	
Reflecting on it later, the way she said it, she might as well have said, ""She has mono..."" or ""She has leprosy..."" and I realized that there must be some misconceptions out there about people with introverted personality traits. Dr. David Keirsey contrasts extraversion and introversion using a battery analogy. When extraverts are socially engaged it stimulates them and 'charges their batteries' but when they are only in the company of their self the batteries run out of juice only to be recharged by more social stimulation. Introverts are the opposite in the sense that their 'batteries' are drained by social interaction and recharged by solitude and introspection. One is not necessarily better than the other, it is simply something that makes us individuals. 
	
It is possible to make introversion or even extraversion, for that matter, stigmatic but I believe that should be avoided. It takes all kinds of people to make the world go 'round and any attempt at trying to create and/or emulate an ideal type of personality temperament would be a major disservice to the Homo Sapien species. Unless, of course, it is Vulcanization of the Human race. Live long and prosper.

**tl;dr: If you receive more fulfillment from spending time with your self than with others there is nothing wrong with you. Fuck the critics and enjoy being you.**

Everyone tells you what a princess you are. They pat you on the head. And the look they give you! Their eyes tell you that you, my dear, are the most precious child on earth.

The gravity of the thing doesn't really hit you for a few years, but when it does, you comprehend far more about death and absence and longing than you should at such a tender age. You spend your summer afternoons playing softball, and secretly, you burn with jealousy at the pitcher, because her dad is the coach. *She's just so damn good.* And in your mind's eye, you see them in their backyard at dusk, fireflies flashing, tossing balls back and forth. You are not envious of new bikes or fancy houses or cool clothes. You are jealous of a moment that you have been denied - the light smell of the mitt's leather on the breeze, the whisk of the ball cutting air, that fatherly voice telling you your form is improving.  

At night, you make your bargains with God. You will be good forever if you can have your daddy back. When there is no answer, you up the ante. Dear God, I will be good forever if I can have my daddy for one day. And when still the universe is silent, you barter your forever for one minute. One minute with your pop. *I promise I will never ask for another thing if I can just have one moment.*

Later, you tell yourself that it's no big deal that you didn't have a dad, that maybe it was even for the best because you became strong and independent and never needed to rely on a man like so many of your peers. But when honesty flickers into your heart, you realize you understand something about people: We all tell ourselves lies, and this is yours. 

All of this was a long, long time ago, and I haven't shed tears for my dad in years, but I happened to remember something my mother told me. She was from Korea, she had no family here, and though she too is gone, I can still hear her words: ""Your father wanted a daughter first. He thought a girl first would be good company for me. You are exactly what your father hoped for.""

A follow up, well, follows: 

Blanche, for all intents and purposes, disappeared over the winter, finally caught in the decline of old age. Where once she trolled the neighborhood daily, now I see her only in the mornings, when she is escorted to a bus carrying her to adult day care. 

If I happen to catch her eye, I wave. She scowls. That part, that's the same old Blanche. Not much else remains, except memories of an old woman who had her own headstrong view of the world. 

Before my mother died (RIP Mom), we lived together here, my mother a little Korean woman and I half white. The first thing we learned from Blanche was our home's former occupant burned down his old garage *(and the God-damned Dago got away with it! Idiot insurance people!)*

The second thing we learned was the Chinese, people like my mother and myself, are a clean race. 

""But Blanche,"" I said, ""We're not Chinese. My mom's from a country called Korea.""

She did not seem perplexed. ""You Chinese, you eat a lot of rice, don't you?""

""Yes,"" I relented. ""We eat a lot of rice.""

Since then, we've learned much about the world according to Blanche. It goes a little like this: 

**Bohemes** = Her kinsman = Only worthwhile people on the planet

**Italians** = Guy who used to live in my house = Scoundrel

**Irish** = Drinkers and my husband = Trustworthy handymen 

**Chinese** = Slanty Eyes, Mom and Me = Tolerable hard working people

**Mexicans** = Funny talkers with dark skin = Dirty people taking over the neighborhood

**Africans** = Darkest Skin = Worse than Mexicans 

If you happen to not find yourself in one of the above categories, you simply do not exist. We'll take my friend Beth as an example. 

Beth stopped by and as a gift, bought me plant pots for the front stoop. As we sat outside planting annuals, Blanche brought round her indispensable lawn chair and faced it toward us. 

""Blanche, this is my friend Beth,"" I said. ""She bought me a present. Isn't that nice?""

She turned her chair and back to us, but I'd catch glimpses of her staring narrow-eyed in our direction. Blanche is not one to welcome strangers. 

That evening, after Beth had gone, my husband and I sat on the stoop and Blanche took up her usual place on the bottom step. My husband began chatting Blanche up about the only topic of interest to the old woman: Goings-on in the neighborhood. 

**Husband:** Aren't the flowers nice Blanche? It's a nice gift from Paperbark's friend, don't you think.

**Blanche:** That woman talks funny. 

**Husband:** She's from another country, she's from South Africa. 

*(We'll pause to note Beth is white South African with hair that borders on black.)* 

**Blanche:** Africa? Naw, she's not from Africa.

**Husband:** She is, her people come from the Dutch. They moved to South Africa a long time ago. 

Now Blanche is a woman of certainty. You are either something or you or not something, and the look of doubt that crossed her face clearly indicated my husband was a geography idiot. 

**Blanche:** She's not African! *She's Chinese.*

My husband, except when it comes to me, knows when an argument is lost, and with that single declaration, the debate was over. 

**Husband:** Oh, Blanche, I was just teasing you. She's Chinese, and she brought those pots and flowers straight from China. 

**Blanche:** Those girls probably made you eat rice for dinner. 

**Husband:** And don't you know it Blanche. And with sticks at that. What kind of a civilized person eats with sticks? 

**Blanche:** They're not right, the Chinese.

Somehow, I rather miss being Chinese, miss the certainty of Blanche's world. And I seem to have a taste for General Tso's Chicken.

A dead end job, a very boring team that isn't even motivated to get a beer for lunch once a month. I felt really bad. I've never felt that the things I accomplished here were meaningful. I wasn't happy and it reflects on everything in my life. 

I'm not in the shape physical shape I was before. When coming home after a day of work, I wasn't as happy as before and my children and my wife could feel it. 

So yesterday I decided that it was enough. I just quit. Because I don't want to leave anybody in trouble, I proposed them to be here one month more to help them on some stuff and they appreciated it. 

The weird thing is that I don't even have another job yet! But the market in my city for my field is more that good and I'm already meeting somebody tomorrow and two others in a couple of weeks. 

The things that I wanted to make sure is to not put my family in trouble. My wife makes a good salary and I have some money aside to be aflot for a couples of month. I was stressed out to resign without another job, but here's what I see today and what I want to share with all of you : 

Freedom. We are all working to live but the real good feeling is freedom. While if may be more difficult for somes, you should try to save money to have enough for you to quit if you want. Not feeling trap in a job because you can't afford it. It may take a long time to get that money aside but once it's there, the feeling that you can do whatever you want for sometime is incredible.

The new job offers I get so far are way way more attractive than what I had. When in my job, many didn't want to offer jobs because the company I work for is big in the city and they usually have relationship with them. Now that I'm free, the emails keeps coming. 

I came home yesterday  happier than ever feeling liberated. I played with my children and we laugh a lot. My wife was almost crying seeing me that happy. 

I'm feeling great. The family is feeling great. Life is too short, be happy or plan to get the freedom that will make you happy if your job is making you miserable. If you have enough security to not put your family in trouble, go ahead. Don't get trapped in a vicious circle. 

I wanted to share and it feels good. Good luck to you all :)

PS. English not my first language. Sorry for grammar and writing mistakes..

Edit : spelling. And thanks to all of you. You kind words an wishes touched me a lot. Reddit is full of good people

UPDATE : This is official I now have a new job...and a way better one with a company with a very good reputation. I will begin at the end of august so that gives me a good 1 month and one week of vacation. Very happy right now :)

I am going to keep it simple. Here is what we do:  

&gt;radioreddit.com is the source for quality new and popular independent music. All music on this site is made by users of the popular site reddit.com  
&gt;
&gt;Our live streams are not controlled by program directors and DJs in the pockets of large labels.  Songs are chosen by an algorithm which only weighs users’ votes when deciding what gets played and what gets excluded as junk.  Songs with high voter approval eventually make it onto the radio reddit charts and get promoted by having a higher probability of being played.  
&gt;
&gt;There are currently four live streams on radio reddit:
&gt;main stream - rotates through an eclectic schedule of hourly genre shows including jazz, rock, metal, punk and electronic, as well as specialty shows such as top of the month and new uploads
&gt;electronic - rotates through several blocks of electronic genres from ambient and avante garde to house and dubstep
&gt;rock - rotates through several blocks or rock genres including metal, hard rock, punk and alt/indie
&gt;hip hop / rap - plays hip hop and rap blocks of music
  
&gt;**radio reddit was created by musicians who wanted a place where all music was given a fair chance to be heard.  Where pay-for-play, label preference, and underhand deals were done away with.  Where listeners were in control.**

We don't expect to change the industry, but we intend to make one hell of a dent.

OK, guys are guys and the maturity level varies pretty dramatically. Girls by nature are more reliable on a number of fronts – but, as we know, there are plenty of exceptions. With that said, girls hold huge leverage in social settings and have to be picky or you end up with a turkey. In short, as they say, if you don’t ask you don’t get. Don’t be above having a strategy that lets you find out what type of stuff the
guy is made of – when you’re in a position to assess the outcome and not get stuck. I’m not a big one for thinking that you can change people’s personalities so, if you see the following boyfriend behavior,
run for the hills…  
  
1. Arranges dates and cancels with either no excuse or lame excuse. Reason: Unreliable and doesn’t mind putting others out - a nasty character flaw. Being let somewhere waiting is not acceptable (unless he calls on the phone an apologizes profusely.  
2. Shows up on date stoned or drunk – REASON: More interested in having fun than making a good impression and is irresponsible. If you are going to get toasted at least do it together.  
3. Is mean, often cranky or dismissive to people – plays the tough guy. REASON: Never go out with anyone with a mean streak, they hit people when they don’t get what they want and are generally abusive personalities. Why anyone likes the “bad guy” is beyond me; I have never met one who wasn’t a jerk.  
4. Lies about stuff – little stuff or big stuff, it doesn’t matter. REASON: If the person is not trustworthy on little things they can’t be trusted on any major things.   
5. Would rather play video games than go out or do something involving real exercise. REASON: This is a future couch potato in the making – lose the dead weight now.  
6. Quits jobs without any other employment lined up or doesn’t take a job because it is “below him.” REASON: Lazy and looks for excuses to avoid work. If you want to be fighting about $$$ for the rest of your life or subsidize that sloth while you’re working - keep dating.  
7. When you’re out on a date or at a party he pays more attention to his friends (male or female) than he does to you . REASON: He’s not that interested and is just marking time.  
8. Doesn’t pay for dates. REASON: The guy’s a cheapskate and that makes life a bummer. Even when I was pretty broke in College the guys paid for the dates; sometimes, we split costs – but not often. You want someone who invests time, money and attention on you – accept no substitutes.  
9. Looks like crap when he picks you up. REASON: Making a good impression on a potential mate is a fundamental condition in nature. You work hard to attract the females of choice. If he doesn’t make the effort now, it’s only getting worse in the future. The LAST thing you
want to be near is someone with poor hygiene or who doesn’t like to shower – cooties galore.  
10. Likes to grub off others rather than paying his own way, or asks you to hit up others for drinks/favors. REASON: Total loser, leech and con man. This is never going to change.  
11. The flip side – has a lot of $$$ but doesn’t have an explanation for where it comes from. REASON: The dude deals with shady people and you don’t want to be anywhere near that crew.  
12. Doesn’t like anything that involves hard work. Likes to gamble or looks for the easy buck. REASON: When there’s kids at home and the money gets tight he’s going to bail -- shortly after taking the last few $$$ and betting them on a horse.  
13. He likes to brag about what he is good at and doesn’t show much interest in your stuff. REASON: Keep away from the self centered bullshit artists. If he has to talk himself up or put others down, the guy is pretty insecure.  
14. Asks you to meet him somewhere rather than picking you up; Doesn’t call to find out whether you’re home safe if you have to travel a distance, or doesn’t escort you home at night. REASON: Where do I start? Males are protective of females that they really like. He either
doesn’t care that much or doesn’t like to be inconvenienced – either way boot him.

Compromise is one of the keys to a happy life. No one gets what they want all the time. Some guys try to.  
  
Now there are things to look for; not all are required but the majority should apply.  
  
What boyfriend characteristics you want:

1. Smiles and is nice to people pretty much all the time.  
2. Looks out for you and is protective of you (NOT POSSESSIVE)  
3. Is intelligent and is interested in learning stuff  
4. Makes an effort to keep you happy and to do fun things  
5. Is reliable for you and friends (keeps his word)  
6. Has some idea on what he wants to do with his life  
7. Has nice friends (Friends are a reflection)  
8. Misses you when you’re not there (calls but not annoyingly)  
9. Does things well and is not a quitter (Skills are the key to success)  
10. Is willing to work hard to get where he wants to go  
11. Is independent and wants you to be independent too  
12. Has a good relationship with his family  
  
I’m sure there are other good attributes but these are some key ones. Hope this helps.

Around November 2011, the chirping became less noticeable as the tenant(s) of the apartment kept the windows closed, but come Spring, the windows were open again, and the chirping was back.  I can tell the apartment is occupied since there are posters on the wall, and music or TV can be heard coming from the window on occasion.

I graduated last summer, and moved across town, thus ending my daily walks past this apartment.  Last night, my husband and I went for a walk around the University to enjoy some of the first Spring weather of the year.  That smoke detector is STILL. CHIRPING.

The posters on the wall haven't changed, so I can only assume it is the same tenant.  By my estimation, there is a person living in this apartment with a chirping smoke detector *for at least 18 months*.  It is loud enough that I once walked past the apartment while on the phone with a friend, and my friend heard the chirp and asked about it.  This happens EVERY. THIRTY. SECONDS.

What sort of monster lives like that?  It infuriates *me*, and until last night, I hadn't even heard it in six months.  And how is the smoke detector battery still functioning?

Me and my friend were catching a late showing of spiderman. Literally as the movie ended the fire alarm went off. We went outside and it was total chaos. people were running and screaming everywhere. we started to make our way through the crowd when we hear murmurings of shots being fired. Right then an 18 year old girl and her friend stumbled up next to us. She had been shot in the leg. i was in shock. we helped her sit down and i ran through the crown to find some help. i saw more people iinjured. officers ignored me as they were still mounting an entry. we finally found help and were asked to help carry her to a staging area. there were several people already there. blood everywhere. ah. this is crazy. finally the iinjured were taken to the hospital. i let several victims use my phone. it was iintense watching them call their loved ones laying on the ground bleeding. things have calmed down that was a while ago. now everyone is waiting to have their info taken so they can leave. lots of cops. helicopters. talks of a bomb(?!). anyway just wanted to make a post while processing. i have video i will post when i get home.



EDIT: Wow, what a night. Sorry for the hasty post. I was just shaken up, my friend was busy and no one I knew was answering their phones. I just had to express something to someone. Sorry if this post was inappropriate in anyway. Now that the info is coming in I really am only struggling more to piece it together. Things of note that I can add from my experience: The standby area that they were moving victims too happened to end up being extremely close to the shooters car. He was parked out back, almost exactly where the victims were being taken. They didn't know, they couldn't of, but knowing that now is crazy. He had explosives in his car. We helped carry a victim there and we were helping out. In all the chaos no officers seemed to mind and we got out of the way when the girls and the guy we were assisting were taken away in a police cruiser. 

I have never seen violence on this scale in my life. Never seen a gunshot, etc. I really don't know what to think. Walking out of that theater, it was truly heartbreaking. Screaming, running, pushing, agony. Just trying to put it all together just when a victim stumbled into us. When she said she was shot I just couldn't grasp it. I saw the wound and I couldn't grasp it. All credit goes to my friend who kept his cool and composure. He really showed his true colors and did everything he could to help. THere were many others with the same attitude, so thanks to all of them as well. A nurse came and assisted us as well as others. With all the negativity tonight I also saw some very moving warmth. 

 thanks for the support, best of luck to all the victims and my heart goes out to the casulites and their families.

**First**, it seems like most people have assigned a narrative to the story that goes something like, ""ghetto black man jumps old white man and gets his comeuppance."" I'd argue that if you look at the story a little closer, that is not what happened. From what I can tell, the black guy was sitting towards the back by himself and took offense to what seems to be a pretty racist comment from Mr. 67 years old, whom it seems was originally in the front of the bus but then came back  to get in this altercation (black guy: ""go back up front""). The black man actually seems to be somewhat more withdrawn in the beginning, but is goaded enough that he responds. Mr. 67 then continues to trade insults and eventually the guy comes up front and takes an ill-advised swing, after which Mr. 67 pummels the black man long after he's clearly no longer a threat.

Watch the girl's second video and see if that changes your mind at all about Mr. 67: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5fnjFVPCek&amp;feature=channel

It kinda seems to me like Mr. 67 is maybe a little imbalanced or possibly on something, went out looking for a fight, and managed to bait the other guy into throwing a punch. Obviously the other guy (and the girl) didn't exactly cover themselves in glory, but I think we maybe need to stop thinking about this as black guy attacks poor old white guy and gets beat.

**Second**, and maybe more surprising, has been the amount of comments directed at black people in general. Maybe I just haven't been aware of it on reddit before, but I was pretty surprised to see so many n-bombs and watermelon jokes thrown around. It's the sort of stuff you expect from a YouTube comment board. I really think that shit is uncalled for. And we really don't know much about the guy at all, other than that he wears corn rows, patronizes public transit, and maybe can be too proud to back down.

Also: many comments have revolved around the idea that white folks suffer from a lot of racism that is ignored because they're in the majority. I think that's kinda bullshit--maybe there is somewhat of a double standard, but white folks do not have it that bad. Not by a long shot. Glenn Beck and co definitely play that card a lot, and a lot of people consider it a dog whistle to deep  southern voters. That doesn't make it okay for someone to call a white guy ""pinky"", but if an alien were to take a guess about the state of our society based on these comment strings, they'd think that whites were some terribly oppressed race. 

I'm sorry to be such a Debby Downer. I usually have nothing but respect for your wisdom and wit, reddit, but I couldn't let this one go.

Clarification: I don't mean to suggest the other man was without fault--very much to the contrary. My points were intended to be: a) I don't think there was a clear right and wrong party here, and b) some of the racial generalizations in the comments went beyond the pale. Sorry for any confusion.

EDITS: grammar, spelling.

I don't have any shame about this, nor do I have any guilt. Though, I do find my self losing faith in humanity because of things like what happened today.

I was in the lobby, taking care of the trash, when I see a mother and daughter duo come in. The daughter is about 13-15 and very overweight, her mother was a elephant in a dress. Now, I normally don't judge overweight people, being a little on the heavy side my self, but this woman was huge and as I learned, didn't care.

So she goes to the counter, and she starts ordering. What she ordered will forever be etched in my brain, so here it is exactly: 1 big mac, 1 large fry, 1 large coke, 2 apple pies and a parfait.

I shake my head, and continue doing my job, listening as the daughter is asked what she wants. She starts to say she wants a salad, but before she can get the words out her mother says ""We can't afford that! She will have what I am having.""

Now, this stunned me for a moment, but I continued to do my job and didn't think anything more of it. Until it turned out I had to take out the trash in the back of the lobby, and heard the following exchange as the mother/daughter couple ate their food.

D: I didn't want this. I wanted a salad.

M: You will eat this and be fucking happy about it

D: Mom, I'm trying to lose weight lik--

M: I WORK ALL DAY TO FEED YOU WELL AND YOU ARE NEVER HAPPY

D, looking like she is going to cry: I am happy, but I want to lose weight. I am so gross mom!

M: Oh So now you are a fucking anorexic, huh? All the more reason for you to eat what I got you.

D: I'm not anorexic! I just don't want to be fat!

M: Eat that food, NOW, or you won't have any more fucking food the next couple days. If you want to be skinny I will make you skinny!

At this point, looking like she is going to cry, the daughter started to eat her food and I had to finish the trash so if anything else happened I don't know of it.

That mother pissed me off so much. There are so many fat kids I see on a day to day, that want to be fat. Hell, I was one of them once upon a time!

1282716322.0,315,self.self,d55k5,The last hour of my teenage life was the greatest battle I have ever had. A little bit my soul died tonight. ,ohhewoo,543,228,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/d55k5/the_last_hour_of_my_teenage_life_was_the_greatest/,"It is 12:40 am, I have been 20 years old for not even an hour and I already had one of the most terrible experiences of my life.

At around 11:30 pm, I'm sitting in my dorm room trying to get some studying done. I get up to use the restroom, passing by one of my clustermates (my dorm has clusters of 2 or 3 rooms that share a bathroom and a common hallway). He mentions he is going to brush his teeth, and I tell him I am going to go poo. Nothing unusual.

I go to the toilet and do my business. I try to wipe myself as clean as possible because I was about to go to sleep - this unfortunately leads to the toilet being clogged. Great. It didn't seem that clogged as the water level barely raised. I flushed again thinking the water pressure would push the clog down. **It didn't.** The water overflowed. I rushed to my room, hoping that no one needed to use the bathroom at midnight. I thought about just leaving it until Friday when the cleaning staff comes... But I remembered that I mentioned to my clustermate that I was going to go number 2; I knew I couldn't hide my guilt. 

I go on my computer and look up ways to unclog a toilet without a plunger, as we did not have one. I saw that dish soap can be used to lubricate the clog and it might go down. I take a bottle of dish soap and empty it into the toilet. A wait 10 minutes and notice that the water level in the toilet dropped. Perfect. I tried flushing the toilet and found out it was still clogged. The added water caused the soap to foam up and my bathroom was covered in foamy excrement. At this point I was getting desperate. I run to my room and grab a garbage bag. I use it as a giant glove and try pushing the water down through the toilet drain with my hands. No dice. I wasn't exactly thinking clearly, and I thought ""I should blow into this balloon and perform a toilet angioplasty!"" 

This did not turn out so well. The pressure needed to blow a bag underwater is pretty large. I heard someone walked in. The toilet is inside a stall so he couldn't see me, but he probably could hear my blowing hard in a toilet stall. I hear him rush out laughing, but that was the least of my concerns. I dispose of the trash bag. Thinking like Macgyver, I unravel the spiral binding on one of my notebooks and try using it to push the clog through the drain. The binding was not rigid enough and just kept bending when I tried shoving it through the drain. 

Realizing I had a lot of studying to do, I roll my sleeves and mentally tell my toilet that I have had enough. Using my palm, I resort to my former plan of attack and stick my hands into the toilet. Without the garbage bag, I am able to cup my hands around the drain. Using rapid fire palm push kamehamehas, I pushed like I was pressing A during a Mario Party Minigame. After 2 minutes, I hear the water flowing. A slow trickle turned into a godly rush as the water level rapidly lowered. I flushed the toilet to hear the satisfying sound of water draining through the toilet. I stood up like a champ at my accomplishment, but knew on the inside that I was defeated. I look at my watch and realize it is 12:20 am. I have spent the last moments of my teenage life, and the first 20 minutes of my birthday, unclogging a toilet with my bare hands. 

TLDR; I spent the last hour of my teenage years unclogging a toilet without a plunger, using my bare hands. 

**EDIT: What are some bad ways you spent your birthday?**

**EDIT 2: Haha thanks for the replies and stories. If anyone is wondering I wasn't actually taking this event that seriously and sulking about it. I originally told this story to a couple of my friends who thought the story was funny and I wanted to share with reddit :P**

The game does literally everything it can to kill you and not let you win, I've had unbeatable enemy ships thrown at me right at the start of the game before, that's the lengths this game is willing to go in order to ensure your destruction. Every single play through is unique, so there's no right answer to scenarios, as that ""right answer"" could very well mean your death the next round, even though it was the right answer last game. Hopefully you get the gist of this game, very challenging. Anyways, I was piloting my ship around and made some bad choices and ended up in a fight that I was not prepared for. It got down to the nitty gritty, that turning point where you hit the ESC key and click restart because you know you're dead, there's no hope, there is no way I'm going to beat this guy. I paused the game and stared at the screen, hit ESC and hovered over the restart button, then saw my crew members helplessly putting out fires that would never go out as their oxygen supply dwindled, fighting a fight that they could not win, and I unpaused it. My ship's hull had gotten knocked down to 1HP, so literally 1 hit could end it all, but we did it, half the damn ship was on fire but there were no casualties and the enemy ship, which was at full health while I was at 1HP, was ripped apart by the remaining weapons I could have online. I paused again, imagined my crew working together to put out the fire that consumed the ship, they were survivors, warriors, and it made me proud. I was unable to immediately repair my ship as the closest repair station was 3 jumps away, so I proceeded to warp in that direction. After reaching the first beacon I encountered a space pirate and my ship was promptly turned into intergalactic space dust.

Was it worth it? Was refusing to rage quit when all hope seemed to be lost, even though literally 5 seconds later we were all thrown into the icy vacuum of space via explosion, really worth it? The answer is yes. I could have rage quit and given up because things seem impossible at the time, but then I would have never known what would have happened had I just stuck around for a little bit longer and gave it my all.

Idk, I believe I'm rambling at this point, but this game showed me that I shouldn't give up on myself, no matter what, never give up, because there's always a chance you'll succeed, and even if you don't, at least you stuck around to the very end and tried.",,False,,t5_2qh96,1361263704.0,,,True,t3_18t4jt,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/18t4jt/a_video_game_just_helped_me_with_my_depression/,

I hope I picked the right place to post this story. I was standing in a very long line at a sandwich shop in Maryland where I live, not far from Washington DC, at the peak of lunch time rush today. There was an older gentleman (I'm 37) in line right behind me who looked to be somewhere around his mid to late 60's. Now around my neck of the woods, people are busy and hurried and stressed and it's kind of unusual that somebody you don't know strikes up a conversation with you. And I'm not exactly an extrovert myself. Usually when you think somebody might be talking to you it turns out they are just actually talking to the bluetooth earpiece linked to their cell phone. That's why it struck me as odd at first when this man asked me, ""Is it like this every day?"" I turned to verify whether or not he had been actually speaking to me or someone else. To my initial astonishment, he was making eye contact with me and did not appear to be talking to somebody on the other end of a phone call or anything. There was a moment of hesitation where I had to recall the proper procedure for handling a situation such as this one where a person I didn't know was actually talking to me. Once the realization that this person was attempting to initiate a genuine conversation with me had sunk in and I managed to wipe the deer in the headlights expression off my face I replied, ""Oh...um, yeah. It usually is about this time of day on the weekdays. Lunch rush and all. I don't come here a lot but they are pretty fast.""

Well the fact that this place had pretty fast service turned out to be a disadvantage to me today because as it turned out, as I got to talking to this gentleman (who's name, sadly, I did not get) I came to learn that he had just arrived in my town by bicycle from Wichita, Kansas. That's a 1300 mile bicycle trip spanning 3 weeks made by a man in his mid 60's. My town was the destination of his trip and he had come to visit his daughter. I wish we had more time to talk and I could have learned all about how you go about preparing for a thing like that. I told him how much I wish I had time to do something like that. I was filled with envy, fascination, and admiration but most of all hope. I have been feeling in a rut lately that all there is to life is that you work the best years of your life away until you retire then you just wait to die. And you are supposed to feel lucky these days to even have a job regardless of how shitty you might feel it is. But this man, who's name I will probably never know, changed my whole outlook in a matter of a few minutes standing in line at a sandwich shop. And it all started with one simple question.

My son was born 13 years and some change ago. I remember the minute he was born, I cried and cried and cried because he was so amazing and beautiful and everything I ever wanted. Fast forward a couple of years and he is constantly having ear infections and he can't walk just right and his speech is lagging. They finally out tubes in his ears and he takes off like a rocket. He starts to walk well and his speech is unreal. 

He's always been a very smart kid. He was reading novels at six or seven years old. When he does his work, it's always straight A's. He plays the piano and the trombone and does both at a much higher level than his age would indicate. he is obsessed, and not a little bit, with exotic cars. He can literally name you every model from every manufacturer that makes an exotic car. Not only that, he can give you almost all of the specs on them. Engine size, type of transmission, etc.

When he was 5 or 6, my wife noticed that he hated to be around people. He's never been very affectionate. He doesn't like to be held a lot. So she a doc look at him, and after some testing, they diagnosed him with being ""in the autistic spectrum"". I refused to believe it. I blamed everything on his lack of being able to hear for so long and that he was just having normal kid issues. As the years went by in elementary school, he developed almost no friends. He has no idea how to start a conversation with someone about something that does not interest him. He has NO idea how to make small talk. He is very short with people when they talk to him. his grades only suffer when he refuses to turn things in, or forgets stuff. Which he does on a pretty consistent basis. during this whole time, my wife made sure that he was getting therapy for his social issues and what not...totally against my wishes. I just thought he was having normal kid issues.

Now he's in middle school. he is on the student council. in the jazz band. in concert band. I made him run cross country this year, and only because he never goes out to play or whatever. I wanted to make sure he got some exercise, and I was hoping that being on a team might help him out. His grades have been good, but he has gotten in trouble here and there because he is rude to teachers and because he has minor meltdowns. Kids will tease him, and he just flips the fuck out. Little shit too. They will say his name over and over, and so he stood up in class, flipped his desk over and threw a pencil at the kid. 

Anyway, today the school called me because he lost his book for class and he just lost his mind. Started crying, yelled at the secretary of the school and just generally could not settle down. I talked to him on the phone and he was totally inconsolable. And then it hit me; everyone else was right and I was just being a prideful cock sucker. My son has an issue that I should be helping him with, but I was too proud to try.

he lives with me. I have one other son who has no ""issues"". I spend a load of time with both of them. I love my kids more than anything else in the world. My son with the issues has been getting counseling for about 6 months now, but I didn't want to hear about Asperberger's syndrome or anything else. ""fix him"" I said. god fucking damnit.

Not looking for pity. I just wanted to get this off of my chest and finally admit somewhere that I was wrong. I won't be ""treating"" him any differently at all, but I will be making absolutely sure that I don't deal with his outbursts like I was before. I had a tenancy to lose my temper a little and send him to his room or ground him or whatever.

I looked relatively nice with fitting clothes, and was nowhere near drunk enough to cause problems. He really wouldn't let me in solely because I was wearing my Rainbows. 

I was told that if I went across the street to the grocery store and bought a pair of cheap shoes that he would let me into the bar. Normally I would have said fuck it, and gone to a different bar. I wouldn't give my business to a bar who is going to pretend that it is a high class bar rather than the dive that it is who discriminates against the sandal wearing community. I walked over to the grocery store, which ended up not selling shoes. 

I end up going to the back of the bar, and offer one of the kitchen workers 10$ to let me in the back door. After some convincing one of them agrees to let me in. While he is walking back in to open the door some guy on the corner starts talking to me. Apparently he was a witness to the nonsense that the bouncer was putting me through, and had a solution to my problem. 

He tells me to come with him to his car because he has some shoes for me. Sure enough this guy has a pair of shoes that fit me that he was willing to let me wear for the night. At this point I am so happy that I got a pair of shoes and can go in to the bar and enjoy my friends birthday. I offer my new friend a shot and a beer to thank him for the shoes, and we get to talking about school, career, etc.

I forget exactly how it came up, but my new friend mentioned something about being a part of an internet community. At that point I had a smug little grin on my face because I had a hunch that it was reddit. He tells me the name of the community that he belongs to, and yup, you guessed it, it was reddit. 

I have read a lot on these forums about redditors helping redditors, but have never witnessed it first hand, nor have I even met a redditor first hand. Turns out reddit is awesome, and so are the members of this community, online and off.

MyEFingMom: ""He's a different man, he has a son, goes to church every day...""

Me: ""Oh, he has his own now? Does he beat it too?""

MyEFingMom: ""(my name)!""

Me: ""Well then what does he feel so bad about that he has to go to church every day?""

MyEFingMom: ""It's not that he feels bad, he enjoys it, he's just a different person now.""

Me: ""Yeah, he did seem to enjoy it.""

MyEFingMom: ""I'm bringing him by for lunch sometime this weekend, he wants to make amends.""

Me: ""Ummm, no you're not.""

MyEFingMom: ""I'll let you know when so you don't have to be there if you don't want to.""

Me: ""Ummm, no I'm not.""

MyEFingMom: ""It's not your choice, it's not your house.""

Me: ""Look, just because it's not my home, doesn't negate my right to object to someone who beat me as a child coming by.""

MyEFingMom: Blank look, ""It's not your choice.""

Me: ""No it's not my choice, but let me tell you the real consequences of your choices. If you bring him into my home, he won't leave alive. I will slit his throat, is that clear? If he wants to apologize to my grandmother for getting caught beating me right in front of her, you can take her out to lunch and he can meet you. I not interested in, willing, or able to forgive to either of you. Someone who would fuck over a defenseless child and someone who would turn their head and allow their own child to be abused, deserves nothing, least of all forgiveness. What do you think I've been working out for all these years? I've been waiting for the day I can rip one of their throats out, just one of those fuckers that you forced into my life because of your inability to be alone for more than two seconds... so now that I think about it, bring him by, I've been waiting all my life for this. Now I just have to figure out the most painful and satisfying way of doing it. Did you see the movie Law Abiding Citizen?""

The only problem was that I was serious. Completely serious. It freaked me out that I had so much rage, and that it had come out of nowhere. 

I hadn't thought about it in at least 10 years. It was as though I was a shaken up bottle of liquid rage and she popped the cork with only a few words. For the first time in 30 years, I saw the light bulb go on in her eyes, if I had to describe her expression, it was something like ""oh shit... it has feelings... I didn't know that... perhaps I've been approaching this all wrong...""

Clearly scared of me, she changed the subject and I haven't heard about it for a couple months. I've never been so angry in my life. I'm not usually that way, very much opposite actually. I'm morally a utilitarian short of human rights violations, I'm a Buddhist, and pro-gun control. I meditate and do yoga regularly. I'm anti-war, and claim to be anti-violence, but I'm not sure where I fall on this anymore since apparently there are people out there that my feelings would override reason and classify as kill on sight without question or mercy. It sounds dramatic, but the point is that it caused an internal double-take at the irony of ""peace and love, but these people should die in a fire without question.""

Does that make sense? What does that make me? A sociopath? A ticking time bomb? I've never been violent, though I can have a temper when I feel I'm wronged. Like when someone backed into the side of my new GTI and didn't leave a note, I put my first through some drywall over that, but I've never directed physical aggression at a person because I couldn't bring myself to hurt another. I've wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to. That's a strange contradiction when contrasted with my uninhibited homicidal feelings toward my moms abusive boyfriends (there was more than one).

You may be wondering why I'm 30 and still dealing with this. The only reason I'm not on the other side of the planet and away from this bullshit is because the people who ended up raising me now need help. My grandparents only have a few years left and are completely disabled. They have no one to help them, and only enough money to survive month to month due to losing most of their retirement fund in the market downturn. They took me in when I was abandoned by my parents (though they had a part to play), so I can't bring myself to leave them, regardless of what I have to put up with from the nightmare that is my family. Don't get me wrong though, they're just as messed up and manipulative as the rest. They did a good number on me when I was a child by turning me against my mom, for my own good of course (gag). All our family dysfunction comes from them, but at least they took care of me rather than just getting me high or physically beating me into submission. With them it was all head games of control and fear. Grandma would use drunk grandpa as a threat, and since I was already scared of men in general, having found that each had a new and creative way to harm me, it was a very effective tool for gaining control over me. I eventually forgave them for the things they did, and even came to pity them for not being able to comprehend that their disgusting abusive actions in raising my mom would somehow impact my life. They're just very old school people who were raised under Nazi occupation. Not to mention that they're so far gone that none of it makes sense anymore. They just want to love and be loved, which is gut wrenchingly ironic since thats the bulk of all I ever wanted in a family in the first place.

As you can imagine, today, I don't do well with or trust any source of authority. I've burned through two dozen jobs because I can't shake the feeling that being an employee is equal to being a slave. Even less than a slave, since it's in the slave owners interest to keep the slave healthy and happy. In business, you get to go to the next person lining up (to be a salve) when one is unhappy of loses health. The business world is juts about who you can fuck over and how to get away with it. I speak from experience. I was tricked into resigning from an 80k/year programming job just because of an unrelated accident that landed me in the hospital for longer than my boss was willing to put up with. He brought some paperwork by during a visit that he had me sign while I was drugged out of my mind. It was a forged resignation, which prevented me from getting unemployment benefits, an act which eventually landed me living in my car and friends couches, effectively homeless. What was I going to do? Sue the crap out of a guy who has nothing and runs his business purely on credit and always in the red?

I'll close this before I completely digress. I want to learn something from all this, but it's such a blur of emotion. Anger, duty, vengeance, justice, sorrow, remorse vs selective remorse, and not being able to shake the morally disgusting fact that everyone turns a blind eye to each others brutality so long as it suits their ends. This whole world is fucked and I look forward to the day I'm free of all of it. A growing part of me wants to tell my mom and her new old boyfriend, ""I'll forgive you if you get the fuck out of the rest of my life, shouldn't be too hard, you didn't seem to have trouble at all doing it for the first half."" I just don't see myself ever being able to accept her as my mother after she shattered me as a child, nor do I feel that I should be obligated to, yet everyone in my family says I'm the one that's fucked up. That I need an attitude adjustment. That I need to forgive. 

I'm not the one that fucked me over.. and over... and over... to the point where it took me 12 years as an adult and the destruction of hundreds of friendships to figure it all out. As I see it, I'm responsible for unfucking myself, that's it. If doing so illustrates their failures, and they can't deal with it, then too fucking bad for them. I'm not going to convince myself to live a lie in order to make them feel better about themselves. Fuck their egos. They were able to force me to do that as a child, which is perhaps the reason why they continue to try and force me into that role today.

Am I nuts? Am I losing it? Am I more on track than I think? Anyone have suggestions? I'm sure I'm not the first or last to go through something like this? How did you learn to thrive in life after this kind of thing? How did you learn to trust in anything or anyone?

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


﻿Greetings Australian Government Officials, Members of Local and International Press, and the General Public. We are Anonymous.

Austrailia - 2/8/2010 - Over the past several years, we have maintained a close watch on the actions of the Australian Government with particular focus on its stance towards internet censorship.

Australia's laws on internet censorship are already among the most restrictive in the western world. Their government filters more internet content than any other Parliamentary Democracy. For some elements within the Government, including Telecommunications Minister Senator Stephen Conroy, this still is not enough. Late in January of 2009 he proposed legislature that would lead to mandatory ISP filtering for all of Australia. The stated goal is to prevent Australia from viewing ""illegal and unwanted content"" on the internet.

Anonymous' concern with this legislature is twofold.

First, the ambiguity of the term ""unwanted content"" is completely unacceptable. No government should have the right to refuse its citizens access to information solely because they perceive it to be ""unwanted."" Indeed, the only possible interpretation of ""unwanted content"" is content that the government itself does not want to be seen.

More importantly, Anonymous does not approve of the steps already undertaken by the Australian Government to control what their populous sees. Claiming to be cracking down on ""simulated child pornography,"" many depictions of women with small breasts in pornography have been banned. Officials cannot claim that they believe the models in these movies are in fact underage, as the production the titles that have been affected are heavily regulated to ensure the age of the models. Instead they are relying on earlier ambiguous wording that allows pornography featuring models that ""appear to be"" under 18 years of age to be treated in the same manner as actual child pornography. 

The repercussions of this censorship of a natural body type on the psyche of Australian women cannot be understated, but this is not Anonymous' concern. The Australian Government will learn that one does not mess with our porn. No one messes with our access to perfectly legal (or illegal) content for any reason.

We are Legion.
We do not Forgive.
We do not Forget

Expect us.

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her look up at me. She could not have been older than 11. I didn't even know books like this existed when I was that old. She asked me what I was looking for. I was quite taken aback by her question. I said, ""Oh, nothing in particular."" She remained looking at me. She looked incredibly sad, almost fed up, tired, just over it. ""What do you think about this?"" she said, holding up the book she was reading. I took the book from her. She was ghastly thin. I noticed the blue of her vein on pale white skin crawling up her arm. 
*Why People Die by Suicide*. I didn't say anything. ""I saw this book on mummy's bed for a long time. She liked this one."" The young girl looked haunted. I asked her where her mummy was. ""With my daddy."" she said.

I assumed them to be somewhere in the bookshop, and scanned my near surroundings. Empty. A hollow shell lined with books and carpeting. What followed was something that came out in a mocking tone, it sounded bitter and remorseful and it grated in her throat when she spoke. I can hear it now,  in my head, and it sounds like an old woman spiteful of the world. It's just ringing. It was almost comical, a farcical episode, but this was real and her soul was nothing but utterly and completely destroyed. 

""He shot her with a gun and then he put it in his mouth and he also died. It is called suicide. When someone is very sick.""
She directed her gaze back at the book. 

Right there, I had probably seen the most devastated, pained, lost, confused, angry and hopeless person in my life.

I'm still dealing with the aftermath of it. There's more to this story, but I need a T.O.

I needed to share, and make it worth reading.

**EDIT** Enjoyed reading the comments. Story is 100% true, although I will admit to allowing my creative juices to add spice. That is not to say that I made anything up, but that I took my time to make it worth reading I guess. 

Quick follow up which I'm afraid is not as suspensful or dramatic as some would hope....

After the cliffhanger she left me, I stood there trying to get my bearings. All I wanted to do was find a book on Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for anxieties and fear, and I now stood there, my problems suddenly seeming as serious as tiddlywinks compared to her tribulations. She reached out her hand indicating she wanted the book back. I handed it over and she tentatively put it back on the shelf, still looking at it. 

I didn't say anything more. It was not my place to, but I was still hounded by the brutal tone of her cynicism. It seemed so out of place. It felt like she had rehearsed this part. As if she had been directed to say it, sardonic, cold, cynically disdainful. 

A small, crooked older woman appeared in front of me and turned to look at the girl, telling her to get up because she was leaving. She too looked worn to the bone. Thin, pale, hagard. She looked like someone you would see representing the 'after' on a poster about Meth addiction. I watched the young girl get up. With the way the old woman's back coiled, she was as tall as her and it was a strange sight seeing them walk out the bookstore. 

I should probably just let this go but everything is still so vivid in my mind. I felt hopeless, confused and really uncomfortable the rest of the evening. This morning is a little better, but hell, I keep replaying it over and over in my mind. A very strange occurence indeed.

Though doing so is quite frowned upon in our society, as it is considered taking advantage of. Now Storytime!

I was at a party last night, and it was hosted by a girl who I really like. Like I've asked her out twice in the past year, but she declined both but I've still liked her a great deal.

I got to the party a little late, but when I did first thing she asked was to give me a tour, so I did, she brought me up to her room, got on her bed. She invited me over, then essentially pulled me down. Normally, this obviously would mean something but since she rejected my twice before I was in denial and did nothing but let her cuddle me. Eventually she starts to feel my chest, then belly, then she keeps going lower. I realize she is probably drunk though the only way I can tell is that she wouldn't do this sober. So I say no, but she keeps going. I keep saying not but she starts begging me to, saying she wants me inside her and other things. I start to think back, and I realize I didn't actually see her take a drink so I have no idea if she is drunk. But she may be and I'm not a douche so I tell her to come back when she's not at a drinking party. She then tells me she has regretted not letting me ask her out since the day I last asked her out, and she actually really wants me, not just in bed but as a boyfriend. She also says she has had nothing to drink and is totally sober. I almost totally believed it except for one thing; the only girlfriends I've ever had were terrible. They usually cheated and were no where near as good as this girl, as in I was sure I was not good enough for her. My low self esteem said no. I tried to get up, but she forced me back down, and tried for about 40 more minutes before I finally got the courage to force her off me. 

There are two worst parts to this story. First, when I got downstairs people were telling me they hoped I didn't actually have sex with a smashed girl, as she had taken shots right before I came. And also later on(today,) she texted me to thank me. And that I was right, and she was just drunk and wanted a fuck buddy to boost her own self esteem. I'm not sure if I'm happy I didn't sleep with someone who was drunk, or happy that I didn't sleep with someone who wanted to use me, or sad that it was fake. Just thought I'd share.

My mother, an EMT, had her company called to the scene. It was heart breaking and terrible.  The point of this post though is that I don't understand why people are donating money to the residents of Newtown and to the school, as if it helps them. I keep hearing about organizations donating to Newtown because of the accident, and I just want to say somewhere that they are one of the richest places in the state of CT.

""*The median income for a household in the town was $90,193, and the median income for a family was $99,192 (these figures had risen to $101,937 and $119,175 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $68,965 versus $42,217 for females.*"" (wikipedia) 

I just felt like saying this. I'll probably get disliked for this, or be called insensitive but these people don't need money. These people need *people*, not money. They need continual love and support. So when you feel the need to donate, instead, donate your time. Say a prayer. Visit a home. Send a letter saying, ""I hope you're having a good day!"" ...or something. I haven't thought that out yet.

Which is a bummer because he doesn't understand that it doesn't come on that day. I'm looking for interesting promotional stuff I can sign him up for. Anything really would work but it would be nice to find something elaborate and colorful. I know this is a bad example but Marlboro used to send us these really complexly folded coupons that he enjoyed opening. My parents spoil him rotten so there's a good chance of them actually spending money on some things. So If you work for or own a business with promo materials, lay it on me.

If you're wondering, he doesn't speak very well compared to other downs persons because he was born deaf but eventually developed healthy hearing in his teens. He's 27 now. 

edit: This is a great response and I really appreciate all the suggestions, however I won't be giving out his address just yet. We'll see how the stuff I've signed him up for already works out and I'll ask our parents about having him receive more personal things.

edit2: You guys have all been great and he is going to go nuts with all the stuff he's going to get. I originally told our mom that I would sign him up for a couple things but I think I'm gonna go ahead and sign him up for as much as possible and just take the dirty looks. 

I was most surprised by how many of you want to make a personal gesture to my brother. I think this is really great and I'm sure it would mostly be a blast. However, my biggest fear isn't injuring my mail man or even the internet having his address, it's that he might open something that he doesn't understand and that we would be unable to explain. For that reason I have decided not to provide the address, I'm really sorry.

I was recently visiting home and, as I was making a grilled cheese, I commented to my dad the cheese wasn't melting like it usually does. I was wondering if Kraft had changed their recipe or something then decided it must be because I recently had been using Kraft with 2% milk... 

My dad started laughing and informed me that for the past 10 years, he has been buying generic cheese and putting it in the Kraft cheese wrapper because he didn't believe my mom, sister, and I could really tell a difference between generic and Kraft cheese. Apparently he also had been slipping the peanut butter label of the Jiffy peanut butter too! I was the first one to notice and hadn't noticed when I actually lived here.

He isn't cheap, he just thought we were making up that we could tell a difference when it came to peanut butter and Kraft, which I still maintain I can. 

TLDR: My dad has been putting generic cheese in the Kraft cheese wrapper for a decade in order to prove the women in my family can't really tell a difference between Kraft &amp; generic American Cheese.

Edit: I am amazed by how many people care that I eat processed cheese! FYI: I use ""real"" cheese for all of my cooking needs except for when I am making a grilled cheese. I prefer the ""fake"" cheese when it comes to a grilled cheese. It is a conscious choice, I haven't been fooling myself into thinking I'm eating the best of the best, or even ""real"" cheese, when I choose Kraft. I simply prefer it.

The female character Sam had apparently ruined her boyfriend Freddie's application to some camp he wanted to go to. Freddie said it was a dream of his and that it would have made him a lock for the college of his choice. His girlfriend apparently did this simply because he did not know what time it was when she asked him. Freddie is understandably pissed and doesn't think that a simple ""I'm Sorry"" from Sam is acceptable. Then the title character swoops in and tells Freddie to just accept the apology and that this kind of behavior is to be expected from Sam.

From Sam that is some seriously psychotic and/or bi-polar behavior. They should be taking her to a doctor, not just shrugging it off. Also from Sam's nonchalant attitude about all of this (very little shame, passive simple apology) and Carly's backing her up they are basically telling young women it's ok to be crazy as long as you are cute. Then there is Freddie. Why would he continue to be involved with some girl who might horribly fuck up his life if he simply doesn't know what time it is? Or continue to be friends with people that feel this kind of behavior is par for the course in relationships?

I know it is just a show and I may be overreacting to the situation myself.

More importantly, I was losing the photos and memories with my family, or pictures of my dog Gizmo who died last year, or of my first meetings with people who would later go on to become close friends.

I had a photo backup, but in an unfortunate turn of events, that drive crashed about a month earlier and could not be recovered. I eventually let it go, but if you’ve ever wondered why I try to stay so consistent with documenting my memories online, this is it.

Yesterday, however, I was going through my trove of external hard-drives in search of an old recording and I stumbled upon a hidden folder.

She knows that I have been going to a jeweler for a while so I let her overhear a ""conversation"" that I was disappointed a ring was on backorder.  Little did she know that it was already in the house.  The next morning I stole her claddagh ring while she was in the shower.

She went through her normal routine for the rest of the morning and finally went to get her ring and began to flip out.  She was looking everywhere, and yelling at the cat (who tends to push things onto the ground and hide them).

Finally, I put the new ring on her chest of drawers and told her I thought I saw her claddagh ring there.  She was checking under it at the time and stood up, saw the box, and froze.  

She opened it as she turned around, I was already on one knee right behind her.  It was a good thing I was because her knees literally went out.

I didn't realize anything different about my eyes, save for the patching we did around age 5, which I loathed - especially when I bumped into trees while playing outside - and my realization at around age 7 when I discovered I was different and legally blind in my right eye.

Hand/eye coordination was always hard, and it still is today. I'm a pretty good table tennis player, but it took a lot of time to even get to an average skillset. Basketball, for me, is still pretty much up in he air, literally. But one thing that really helped with the hand eye coordination was video games, I spent hours playing my favorites until I beat them, and back when I played often, I was one of the best players in my group of friends. But hand-eye coordination never came easy, it took time and diligence.

Fast forward to around age 14. We had moved around a lot and I was displaced from the friends I had made through school. This final location that we moved to was very rural and only 3 or so families in town had kids in my age range. Meeting people meant traveling an hour down the mountain to the nearest big town. Bored and with too much time on my hand, I did what any rebelling teen would do - I got into a lot of trouble. On one particularly rebellious night, my Mom and my Grandmother were talking with me, trying to find an apt punishment for staying out late with my friends. My grandmother, with a few drinks already rolling through her system, in a particularly harsh tone said something like ""straighten your eyes, you Mom paid good money for that surgery."" This was the first time that anyone had said anything about it, and it struck me, hard. It was painful, particularly so, because I was already dealing with all of the physical modifications puberty has to offer. This stuck with me, as if I had any control over the situation, and to this day my grandmother and I still do not have the same relationship we had before the incident.

But it just kept getting worse and worse. Sometimes I would talk to people and they would ask ""Are you looking at me? Or, are you talking to me? Which felt like a sharp knife to the chest every time someone would say it. It also made it hard to meet new people, because generally, people avoid people that are ""different"" or that sympathetic ""your handicapped"" looks washes over their face. 

So I had my solutions for a time, to hide my affliction in any possible way. I'd wear my sunglasses all of the time, even at night, you don't know how many times I'd heard that freaking 80's song sung or whistled in my direction. Or I'd use the muscles in m eyes that I had and cross my eyes, and this worked somewhat, until I'd forget, or I'd blink, and the eyes would move and freak people out. I thought I was doomed to living like this for the rest of my life. Unfortunately, no matter how hard I tried or what I was able to accomplish, this would be one thing that defined me.

Until it wasn't. About a year and a half ago, my eye doctor and I were talking about me moving to California - which I was mulling over at the time. He said that they have a great eye program at Berkeley and that they may be able to help me out. HE also said I could get the surgery that I had as an infant again to realign my eyes. Well, this got me thinking, why would I need to wait to move to California? I had insurance, surely there was a professional around here that could do it. And so I began to look for a physician in the area, and I found one that was rated excellent all over the Internet. 

He mostly worked with children, because parents are concerned, of course, about their kids, and it seems adults just usually are okay with one surgery, or they just deal with their condition. It was a little crazy to think, after 28 years, that I could get this fixed. He took a look over the eyes, ran some tests, and said I was a good candidate for surgery.

Surgery happened 3 months later, I was nervous of course, but not terribly, I was looking forward to not being defined by the way I look. The surgery was done in 2 hours. I got up walked to the car, took it easy for the week, and by the next week, I was back to work.

It wasn't painful in the least. The muscles felt ""tight"" for a while and my eye was red for about 2 months, but now most of that has subsided. The stitches came out after a few weeks and were itchy and irritating, but I think that was the most discomfort I had. The cost? Somewhere around $5,000 which insurance covered for about 60% of it. The drawback is that I may have to have surgery again in another five years or so, time will tell.

Seriously, if you have a lazy eye, take some time to look into the realignment surgery. I gained confidence back that I had lost, I feel better, and I can now look into people's eyes without the fear. And I don't have to wear my sunglasses at night anymore.

But her health has been failing, and she's not out shoveling her walk or cursing the neighborhood kids these days. So this is a bit of an ode to cranky old Blanche. 

A few random things to know about her. She's an old Boheme, and knows a stunning array of racial epithets. She talks a bit like a toothless pirate with a mouth full of cotton and she generally doesn't like women, including me, though she loves my husband, and would often say to him, ""If I were younger, I might have gone for you."" This statement would send my husband into a fit of shudders, mostly because Blanche is not known for her hygiene. So, to make him feel better, I would say, ""You know, she's dry and crumbly as a mummy down there.""

Sometimes when we did a favor for her, she would knock on the door, a plate of roast beef and potatoes in hand. It would always be a serving for one. If I happened to answer, she would push it toward me and say, ""Give this to the man."" (I am referred to as ""The Girl""). 

All in all, Blanche is rather like a crazy bag lady who actually owns house.

I was getting rid of some landscaping blocks and advertised them for free to anyone willing to carry them away. A lovely woman responded, and she and her male friend spent a good bit of time putting them into an SUV. The woman and man, it should be noted, were black. 

Blanche turned her trusty lawn chair so it faced our backyard, and watched with scowling disapproval. I told them quietly to ignore the old woman, and that she'd passed many hours staring at me as I gardened. I thought nothing more of it, until I happened to look out the window. 

The man was at the fence chatting with Blanche, and I knew she’d waved him over to insult him. No good could come of this. 
Later, I told him that whatever Blanche had said, he should please disregard it and I hoped she didn’t offend.
 
He recounted the conversation: 

“The Girl let you come in her yard?” Blanche said.  

“Yes ma’am.” 

“I don’t like the blacks. Can’t trust the darkies one bit. Got that one trying to be president.”

“Yes, I believe I’ve heard about that,” he said.

“Course the blacks are better than the Mexicans. Goddamn Mexicans all over this neighborhood. Don’t do a goddamn thing, the spics. Least The Girl’s got you working to carry away rocks.” 

Embarrassed, I started with apologies, but the man just sort of smiled, held his hand up and shook his head. “No need to explain,” he said. “There’s one in every family. I’ve got an old uncle the same way about whites.”

I am thankful he found the matter amusing. After these many years, we’ve chalked up a healthy number of Blanche stories and I say with a bit of melancholy, they seem to be coming to an end. Her edge has worn away with her health.

1309537357.0,297,self.self,ieb9w,3 weeks ago I traded my sit-down desk for a stand-up desk. These are my observations.,pingsmoth,486,189,207,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ieb9w/3_weeks_ago_i_traded_my_sitdown_desk_for_a/,"I recently started using a standing desk at my office job after having a traditional sit-down desk for almost two years.  For the past 7 months I have used an exercise ball as my chair, but even though I liked the increased motion that offered as opposed to a regular desk chair, I still wanted more.  Three weeks ago I started using a [standing desk](http://www.geekdesk.com) and these are my observations after standing up for three weeks eight-hour workdays.  This is not a peer-reviewed study or professional journal article, so don't take my observations as definitive conclusions, but I thought it might give some insight for those who are wondering about switching to a standing desk.

**Physical Health**
I move around more.  Before this desk, each time I had to go somewhere or get something, even if it was right in an adjacent office, there would be a twinge of hesitation.  Do I really need it enough to justify getting up from my sitting position? Often the answer would be Yes, but more than I would like I would just remain stationary, thinking ""I'll get it later.""  Now there is no barrier to me getting up from my desk since I'm already on my feet.  I just walk over and get what I need and come back.  I also find myself shifting back and forth at my desk far more often, whether it's moving from side to side to get to different computer screens or just shifting my weight.  Before this I would often have parts of my legs fall asleep from inactivity due to excessive sitting. 

My legs hurt.  Perhaps this will abate with time, but right now my calves and soles of my feet are sore at the end of the day.  We have carpeted floors in my office and I wear comfortable shoes with good support, but they're no match for eight hours of standing.  In high school and college I worked at a grocery store where I was on my feet for 8+ hours per day and my body adapted pretty well, and I was only sore after very long shifts.  I assume my body will adjust once again to being in a standing position all day, but high school was more than a decade ago and I'm not getting any younger, so perhaps the soreness is just a byproduct of age.

I feel hungry more.  Studies on how much energy is required to stand vs. sit all day come to various conclusions, but all seem to agree that standing burns more calories than sitting.  I used to snack out of boredom, reaching for some chips or candy simply because it was there.  Now when I do munch on food at work it's because I'm actually hungry, and by the end of the day I feel just a little more worn out than I used to.  Mind you, I don't exactly move around a whole lot at my office job, and I'm not comparing this to a manual labor job which requires constant physical activity.  But I can certainly tell a difference between using a standing desk and sitting all day.

Stairs are a breeze.  Like I said, I'm in my lower 30's and it's not like they were difficult before or anything, but when I have to go up 4 floors I don't feel a thing anymore.  Previously my legs would feel just a tad wobbly and I would be a little out of breath, but now I can bound up those stairs like it's nothing.  I have to stress that correlation is not necessary causation, and it's entirely possible my standing desk has nothing at all to do with climbing stairs easier.  But it is something I have observed, hence its inclusion here.

**Physiological Effects**
I am more alert, especially in the afternoon.  Prior to using my standing desk, I would feel a wave of tiredness come over me after lunch that would be difficult to dispel.  Not sleep-inducing tiredness, but a general sense of lethargy.  I would move slower and generally not be as productive as I could be.  Now I feel much more alert and active throughout the day, just because I'm standing instead of sitting.  I also find it easier to concentrate on one thing at a time, but for tasks that require prolonged intense thought and focus I think a sitting position is better.  That's just me, though, and your results may differ.

I can multitask easier.  I don't know why, but I find myself more capable of handling multiple tasks at once while working at my computer. Here's my theory: when I was sitting, I tended to compartmentalize things.  ""I'll work on this for 5 minutes, then that for 10 minutes, etc."" Now I can more easily slide between multiple projects at once, giving my attention to a variety of activities without losing focus like I used to.  If I had to guess I would say this is due to increased awareness overall since I am standing and more alert in general.

**Interpersonal Communication**
Conversations with people have taken on a whole new dynamic.  Maybe this is just me, but I always felt awkward sitting down when people came into my office to ask a question, get help, or just chat for a bit.  I would often stand up so I could be at eye level  but that felt weird too, as if I had to pause what I was doing in order to talk with someone.  If I needed to show a coworker something on my computer, he or she would have to lean down and look at my screen while I sat there, and it just felt a little strange.  Now, conversations have taken on a much more natural quality.  Again, this is probably just me and your mileage will vary, but I feel much more comfortable and relaxed when having conversations with people. There's no visual interruption when someone walks into my office, and people will come over and rest an arm on my desk as we discuss a topic or I help them with a question. We can spread documents out and examine them together without the awkwardness that comes from one person standing and one person sitting at a desk.  It has made interpersonal interaction much more enjoyable and natural.

**Conclusion**
I realize plenty of people have jobs that necessitate standing all day but for anyone who works at a traditional desk, I highly recommend some type of work surface that allows you to stand up.  Even if it's just for just part of the day, you will likely notice an increase in your mental activity and feel far more energetic at work.  There's probably a lot of stuff I forgot to include here, and I'm sure other Redditors who use stand-up desks will have their own opinions too.

**Edit 2**: Some commenters have mentioned the idea of sitting down at various points during the day. The desk I have is motorized and allows the user to raise and lower it throughout the day.

About a year ago, I discovered my ex was cheating on me with an ex of hers located out of town (but close to her mother, whom she would go visit).   We went to a marriage counselor - but the ex wanted to stop going because she felt the counselor was ""on my side.""  She would not take the counselor's advice to find a doc to talk to about her depression (she has never really known happiness).   When I discovered she was still talking to her ex a few months later, I found a mediating divorce attorney (a mediating attorney = a lawyer for both of us.  She was recently unemployed, so if I had found my own divorce attorney, a judge would make me pay for one for her too).

California is a community property/no-fault state.    With her unemployed, straight down the line of family law (without another agreement in place), she would be entitled to ~40% of my pre-tax salary for 21 months (1/2 the term of the marriage at time of filing) as well as half of any stock options &amp; 401k I earned.     Debt accrued is totaled and divided in half.        

I made the agreement of giving her a more-than-half specific amount of stock+401k in exchange for all of my salary (monetary values were roughly similar) as well as a few other things to avoid unexpected surprises to her finances, such as any veterinary bills (for the dog I dearly miss) for 1 year.

A few weeks after the agreement was signed, I drove a moving van for her with all of her stuff in it back to where her mom lives... then flew home.  It was good closure.

In CA, it takes 6 months from filing for a divorce to be final - and that day happens to be today.

I did enjoy being married and am not cynical about getting re-married.   My advice is simply to trust your instinct.

The socks I've been looking for my entire life.  I post [exhibit A](http://imgur.com/FF4ON) (there is no B)

These were made under the kirkland brand and sold at Costco stores.   They were so good, I gave them to friends who also agreed that they were the sock of all socks.   I rounded up every other athletic sock I owned, laundered them, and then gave them to a homeless guy that hangs out by my office. I then bought 40 pairs of these beauties.  Lo and behold, after 2 years, my supply has dwindled and Costco doesn't carry them anymore....opting for a much thinner, inferior sock.  

Does anyone know where to get more of these? How about suggesting a suitable replacement that has the features outlined in the above photo?

Google has left me empty handed.   

Help me reddit, you're my only hope

EDIT: [GodOfAtheism](http://www.reddit.com/user/GodOfAtheism) has provided me with a link that seems to be the real deal. I have provided him with a small gold token of appreciation.  Why I couldn't find that after searching google is beyond me.   It's painful that there is a $20 premium over what I bought them for, but isn't that just the way of life?   If anyone finds them cheaper than $33 a bundle, let me know, and you may also receive a little surprise in your inbox. 

EDIT2:  I've received quite a few comments and PM's about how I could use up socks so quickly.  As I've explained, I spend any non-outside moment in socks, so I'm rough on them scooting around work and home all day with no shoes on.    Only a few were lost, the rest were simply worn out.  It's been slightly over 2 years.   Roughly about 700 days.  Now if we concede a fairly generous sock attrition count of 4 pairs lost to dryer fairies and hamper elves we're left with 36 pairs.  Based on a loose count, I've burned through about half of those.  (The slightest hole or tear is cause for an immediate discard)  So I've used up 18 pairs in 700 days. This means I wear each pair about 39 times before I wear them out.  The socks I wore before were lucky to make through 20 wash/wear cycles.  What made me come here was the realization that as the number of good pairs starts to dwindle, the wear cycle doubles for the smaller available pool of socks.   I'm not sure if the wear-out rate is a logarithmic function, but it definitely is accelerating at an alarming rate.  I'm sure the more math savvy here could graph this function in their spare time.

Edit2: When I've clicked on qkme.me links from home, my Avira anti-virus has blocked things coming from the site. Separately from the office I've had another anti-virus software kick in when clicking on the site. So I can only conclude the site is the problem and needs to be better maintained.

I was in a relationship for ten months with a guy who was verbally and sometimes physically abusive. He was a classic case: he told me that I made him angry, he got upset over the slightest things, and he had a nice sob story ready whenever I threatened to leave him.

I've spent the past couple of years wondering why the fuck I stayed with him for so long, and I've finally figured it out:

**I thought that being a grownup means being able to forgive and forget, and to resolve relationship issues by talking about them. While this is completely true for good relationships, it's a very bad idea in abusive relationships.**  

I thought that grownups were people who could man up and love someone despite the occasional violence. And I wanted to be that kind of grownup person. I'm glad I know better now.

When a relationship is abusive, being a grownup means having the balls to leave your partner, no matter how tragic their sob story is.

If you're in an abusive relationship, please don't see it as a ""project"", as a situation you just have to face with a mature attitude, or as something you just have to bear for your partner's sake. Instead, **get the hell out.** Just do it.

1345212442.0,292,self.self,ydkre,Today my Brother was declared terminally ill. I ask Reddit to share this story and show him support ( PICS ),coltonomnom,484,192,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/ydkre/today_my_brother_was_declared_terminally_ill_i/,"It all started 13 years ago when my brother was just a kid at the age of 4. He started getting headaches, double vision, lack of balance- all text book symptoms of brain tumours. Days later, we come to find out from an MRI that he had a benign tumour located near the brain stem ( an area extremely risky to operate on ). Cutting some of the story short, he received 2 major brain surgeries, chemotherapy, and radiation before we had stopped this benign tumour from growing. Finally, doctors had informed us that it was stable after we finished his go at radiation in Toronto at the sick kids hospital at the age of 13. 

Fast forward to this last September. He started getting strange symptoms and sensations on the left side of his body that included numbness, weakness, a weak muscle to mind connection. As the whole family was paranoid to begin with, we went for an MRI scan. We sat down to talk with doctors and again received some awful news.

Your son has cancer. 

To me this was horrible news. The absolute worst, to be quite frank. Now, this time, the tumour had actually grown into and around his brain in the thalamus area which plays a large role in all motor skills. As the tumour grew, his whole left side of his body started to deteriorate to the point where he was not mobile. He was forced out of going to the gym, tracking and field, running, lifting weights. He lost all quality of life at this point being an active teenager. 

Again, cutting the story short. We tried chemotherapy. After weeks of him taking these medications like candy, his symptoms started to subside. He was getting better each and every day as his left side was getting stronger and stronger.  Now, to most, this would mean his tumour was shrinking, relieving pressure around the thalamus. But after yet another MRI, the tumour had actually grown even more, but the chemotherapy had actually taken down a good portion of the swelling, relieving some of the symptoms.

Next step was radiation. Seeing as he had it once before, doctors were skeptical because of the serious long term side affects involved in this procedure. After being off the chemo, his symptoms, again, were getting worse. He was at his all time worst during the first treatment of radiation. I can't explain how bad his symptoms had been. He had told me in the hotel they were staying at, he was hallucinating about the whole room being a large chess game, and each piece of furniture was a chess piece. His left side of his body was having tremors from the swelling being so bad. After a couple weeks of daily radiation, his symptoms started to become less prominent, again. He was getting progressively better, again. 

Few weeks after radiation, things had been going extremely well. He was back to his old self aside from some residual weakness on his left side. 

So, once again, we go back for a scan, seeing as thats the only way we can see what is going on upstairs. Doctors were astounded. His tumour had completely shrunk to the size of pretty well nothing. Although, some scar tissue left, that was all that was left. They told us he was cancer free. We went home with absolute joy, it was like nothing could stop us now. We beat not 1, but 2 brain tumours? One being cancerous?

Nope. Recently his left sided symptoms had come back. Being absolutely paranoid by this point, we scheduled another scan. And surely, the cancer is back. Growing at an even faster rate than it had been before. They declared him terminal today. Time frame is unsure at this point, but time will only tell.

Now, i'm sure he will be reading this, and I don't want to get into any deep details. But I want reddit to be completely aware of how strong this kid is. Year after year, treatment after treatment, heart ache after heart ache, he never complains about anything. He puts other people before himself. Even today, being told he is terminal, he finds a way to add that positive swing on it. He has done so much for the hospitals, whether it be fundraising, raising awareness, any time of volunteer work when he can. He did public speaking for schools, hat days, balloon releases, you name it. The kid is an absolute champion. He had to drop everything- sports, going to school to become a civil engineer, friends lost because of being to and from hospitals. And yet, he is OK with it all.

I just want to raise awareness to his story. And how hard it has been for everyone, not just my family. He has become an inspiration for so many people. I'd love for this story to make the front page, just so people can get a sense for how lucky they really are to be living a healthy lifestyle. I'm sure there are many reddit users out there that have been in the battle against cancer themselves, or for family. And I would love to hear from them. And like I said, i'm sure he will be reading this story, so be sure to send lots of love his way.

Thanks so much reddit.

It seemed to interest people so I thought I would give it some better publicity.


""The Onion""


I will keep this story shorter for the sake of posting so forgive the lack of gravitas in the delivery.


When I was in High school me, my friends, and all of our dads would rent a houseboat at shasta lake in california every summer. During our junior year trip we took the houseboat way up one of the arms of the sacramento river and while the dads were in the boat my friends and I were all being dragged behind on rafts/tubes/etc. As we rounded a bend in the middle of nowhere we see a houseboat with possibly 6-10 fully naked women sunbathing.


There were some life vests buckled onto some of the rafts for handholds and as we are cruising past one of them became...unbuckled. We moored maybe a quartermile upriver and immediatly the dads were discussing who would take the speedboat to go get the lifevest back. Upon their return with the vest they told all of us hormonal teenage nerd boys that the boat was indeed ""covered in naked women."" We decided to immediatly set out for a closer look.


Unfortunately the shore was quite steep and covered in shale so while my friends left with a pair of binoculars i turned around, hoped onto one of the 3-person rafts and began paddling towards the nakedwomanhouseboat. Upon rounding the bend separating our boat from theirs I suddenly started wondering what the fuck I was doing. Here I was, an overweight, nerdy, star wars obsessed high schooler with little direct woman skillz and i am paddling a beeline for a nakedwomanhouseboat in the middle of nowhere with all of my friends watching an no plan to speak of.


I began thinking, what possible excuse could I use to get closer to this nakedwomanhouseboat and I remembered our plan to make spanish rice for dinner. Maybe I could borrow some salt like a good neighbor would? No, how would I get it back to our boat paddling in the middle of a fucking lake? I needed to borrow something that could be transported easily, not sound rediculous to borrow, and be an ingredient in spanish rice.


AN ONION.


I looked back and saw my friends watching through the binoculars and commenced paddling. As I neared the nakedwomanhouseboat it briefly occured to me that I must look fucking rediculous paddling with my hands up to this boat while lying on my belly on a 3-person raft. Didnt care, I was so damn close to seeing more naked women then my mind could comprehend.


I paddled up to shore and walked up the plank to the ""front door"" of their boat and knocked on the door.
I have to say this now, this story is true. If I were telling it to you it might be exaggerated slightly, but typing doesnt give me that luxury. I just want you to keep this in mind as I wind this story up.
The door was opened by an absolutely gorgeous and quite naked woman. In hindsight the whole situation played out as if everything was completely normal. She asked me who i was with a smile and I told here about our spanish rice conundrum. She turns to go find an onion and as she is BENT OVER looking through the cupboards and cabinets I see a couple of other woman just kicking it. They act like I am the second person that day to ask to borrow an onion and go about their business. I think one was reading a book.


Right as the nakeddooranswerer says she found an onion one of the doors in the nakedwomanhouseboat opened and a man and woman, who were later established to be having sex from the evidence at hand, poked there heads out and asked me whats going on.


""Making spanish rice, needed an onion.""


""Cool""


Im given the onion, I thank them, hop on my raft and paddle away.
We ended up not making spanish rice and I kept the onion inside of one of those clear, plastic baseball display cubes until the day it was attacked by ants and I was forced to part with the only physical evidence of one of the best stories of my adolescence.",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_efj6q,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/efj6q/the_onion_my_nudity_story_from_an_askreddit_post/,

I'm using a throwaway account here as my GF is also a redditor and sometimes likes to use my computer to browse.


Let me start off by saying I'm not a very emotional person. When things go wrong, I'm not entirely opposed to speaking to others, I just prefer to try to deal with it myself and not in some macho-jock way...it's just the way I am so I am a bit uncomfortable in doing this at the moment. Right now though, I feel like I just need somebody to turn to. 

Here goes. So my girlfriend of 4 years hits me out of the blue this morning with ""if something might be seriously wrong with me, would you want to know now or wait until I know for sure""...I know, a bit of a dumb question as obviously I will want to know now. 

She tells me that she hasn't been feeling all that great lately so she went in for a physical. They did an ultrasound on her and found 'something' on her pancreas. They say it could be a number of things including an infection, mineral deposits, pancreatic cysts...or cancer. They told her all are equally likely but she is presenting all the symptoms of cysts, an infection or cancer (all 3 of these have similar symptoms). I'm sure the vast majority of you know, but pancreatic cancer patients die within 5 years 9/10 times if not caught early.

She already had an MRI and will get the results on Monday at the latest and will also get a biopsy on Monday. They told her the MRI might be able to tell them what it is but there is no guarantee other than the biopsy results. She doesn't want to talk about it more than she has to right now and she doesn't want anybody we know finding out about it just yet (understandable). 

I'm not looking for this to get very much traction, I am just very scared and I feel like it would be nice to talk to a couple of people right now. Maybe even somebody who knows a thing or 2 about this type of thing who can answer some questions?

I’ve watched the [TiR](http://www.reddit.com/user/Trapped_in_Reddit) account over the last few weeks wondering what this individual (individuals? robots? aliens?) was up to and last night the user [tencents](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/v6tbs/oh_dog/c51wuch) linked a post/comment that tied to the one at hand. This got me thinking, so after checking only one more post/comment and finding a match, I jumped at the opportunity to share what I was able to confirm.

I jumped the gun.

I don’t know how this account amasses so much karma, but using the method that TiR admitted to was only used (as far as we can tell) a handful of times. Nowhere near enough for 500k+ comment karma. Many of TiR’s comments are contextual or personal in nature – there’s definitely a human being in there. Amongst other devices or people? Who knows.

Bottom line: by its own admission, TiR was experimenting with Reddit users for a handful of comments on reposted pictures, netting a few hundred comment karma. That’s it. That’s all we know for certain. This does not invalidate what the account has accomplished in way of community contributions over the last two months.

Karma is an odd thing. It’s an imaginary or arbitrary reward given to users of the site by users of the site. It is not redeemable for anything and more often than not is the product of chance, but it keeps us coming back for more all the same. At the end of the day it’s bragging rights at most. Most visitors to the site don’t even comment or post, making it even more of a niche feature to those of us who participate on a daily basis. Whatever the end-goal of the TiR account, it should be obvious even before this took place that it is just here to observe the community and its reaction to various comments – what works, what doesn’t. I’d have to imagine that the person behind the account takes great pleasure in participating and joining in the fun – the absolute last thing on Earth I’d ever want to do is be the catalyst to taking that pleasure away. Least of all instigate a witch hunt.

I humbly ask that we let this one go. Begrudge, fine. Feel a bit taken advantage of, okay. But this is not worth asking someone to end their life over. This is not worth sending messages filled with hate. Try to find some perspective here. We’re all here to have fun, expand our minds, and participate in the Reddit community. What that might entail is something completely different to absolutely everyone here.

I feel that I owe an apology to the Reddit moderators and administrators. In the heat of the excitement over the last 24 hours, there have been posts/comments made by myself as well as others that had been removed from various subreddits. The reasons were sound in almost all cases, mostly due to being off-topic from the respective areas in which they were posted. This was our own fault for not reading each area’s posting rules close enough and I apologize for any flak caught by the areas’ respective moderators. Specifically /r/todayilearned and /r/KarmaConspiracy: moderators had removed initial posts with good reason – they had absolutely no business being posted in those subreddits. Any other removals I’ve found to be for a good reason one way or the other, especially anything targeting the TiR account in a negative way. Please do not target moderators or administrators either. They are looking out for everyone’s best interest and just want to keep peace.

Can we please get back to our normal Reddit viewing positions?

EDIT again - why the hell is there a strikethrough on the title? Sorry Reddit.

Jack Layton's final letter to all Canadians:

Dear Friends,
Tens of thousands of Canadians have written to me in recent weeks to wish me well. I want to thank each and every one of you for your thoughtful, inspiring and often beautiful notes, cards and gifts. Your spirit and love have lit up my home, my spirit, and my determination.

Unfortunately my treatment has not worked out as I hoped. So I am giving this letter to my partner Olivia to share with you in the circumstance in which I cannot continue.

I recommend that Hull-Aylmer MP Nycole Turmel continue her work as our interim leader until a permanent successor is elected.

I recommend the party hold a leadership vote as early as possible in the New Year, on approximately the same timelines as in 2003, so that our new leader has ample time to reconsolidate our team, renew our party and our program, and move forward towards the next election.

A few additional thoughts:

To other Canadians who are on journeys to defeat cancer and to live their lives, I say this: please don’t be discouraged that my own journey hasn’t gone as well as I had hoped. You must not lose your own hope. Treatments and therapies have never been better in the face of this disease. You have every reason to be optimistic, determined, and focused on the future. My only other advice is to cherish every moment with those you love at every stage of your journey, as I have done this summer.

To the members of my party: we’ve done remarkable things together in the past eight years. It has been a privilege to lead the New Democratic Party and I am most grateful for your confidence, your support, and the endless hours of volunteer commitment you have devoted to our cause. There will be those who will try to persuade you to give up our cause. But that cause is much bigger than any one leader. Answer them by recommitting with energy and determination to our work. Remember our proud history of social justice, universal health care, public pensions and making sure no one is left behind. Let’s continue to move forward. Let’s demonstrate in everything we do in the four years before us that we are ready to serve our beloved Canada as its next government.

To the members of our parliamentary caucus: I have been privileged to work with each and every one of you. Our caucus meetings were always the highlight of my week. It has been my role to ask a great deal from you. And now I am going to do so again. Canadians will be closely watching you in the months to come. Colleagues, I know you will make the tens of thousands of members of our party proud of you by demonstrating the same seamless teamwork and solidarity that has earned us the confidence of millions of Canadians in the recent election.

To my fellow Quebecers: On May 2nd, you made an historic decision. You decided that the way to replace Canada’s Conservative federal government with something better was by working together in partnership with progressive-minded Canadians across the country. You made the right decision then; it is still the right decision today; and it will be the right decision right through to the next election, when we will succeed, together. You have elected a superb team of New Democrats to Parliament. They are going to be doing remarkable things in the years to come to make this country better for us all.

To young Canadians: All my life I have worked to make things better. Hope and optimism have defined my political career, and I continue to be hopeful and optimistic about Canada. Young people have been a great source of inspiration for me. I have met and talked with so many of you about your dreams, your frustrations, and your ideas for change. More and more, you are engaging in politics because you want to change things for the better. Many of you have placed your trust in our party. As my time in political life draws to a close I want to share with you my belief in your power to change this country and this world. There are great challenges before you, from the overwhelming nature of climate change to the unfairness of an economy that excludes so many from our collective wealth, and the changes necessary to build a more inclusive and generous Canada. I believe in you. Your energy, your vision, your passion for justice are exactly what this country needs today. You need to be at the heart of our economy, our political life, and our plans for the present and the future.

And finally, to all Canadians: Canada is a great country, one of the hopes of the world. We can be a better one – a country of greater equality, justice, and opportunity. We can build a prosperous economy and a society that shares its benefits more fairly. We can look after our seniors. We can offer better futures for our children. We can do our part to save the world’s environment. We can restore our good name in the world. We can do all of these things because we finally have a party system at the national level where there are real choices; where your vote matters; where working for change can actually bring about change. In the months and years to come, New Democrats will put a compelling new alternative to you. My colleagues in our party are an impressive, committed team. Give them a careful hearing; consider the alternatives; and consider that we can be a better, fairer, more equal country by working together. Don’t let them tell you it can’t be done.
My friends, love is better than anger. Hope is better than fear. Optimism is better than despair. So let us be loving, hopeful and optimistic. And we’ll change the world.

All my very best,

Placed my order totaling $69...(giggity)...anyway the flowers arrive at her work and they are pathetic, they look nothing like what I saw online, they were brown, wilted, filler was sparse and just down right embarrassing.

Anywhere I can reach (US destinations are easier, but I would go far and wide), **I'll go if you have a challenge/event of some sort!**  Ideally I'd like to spend two to four days per city/country/location.

Give me events to do!  Want me to hand deliver a letter to someone across the country?  Attempt to help you with homework?  Volunteer at your organization for a day?

This would need to be planned out to make an itinerary so I don't end up doubling back across the globe repeatedly.  If there's interest we could make a temporary subreddit for it (like the Jetblue guys)-- although I'd rather someone else moderate it so you guys know I'm not picking and choosing events.

Since I've returned and been discharged after serving out my contract, I've started my life over in a new town, making new friends, and basically, putting the military portion of my life behind me.  In my time overseas, I saw some really not good things, with which I have reconciled mentally.  I don't identify with my time of service, and it almost never affects me.

Anyways, last night, I had a dream about Iraq for the first time since I'd been back. Nothing too specific, I was just *there.*  I woke up with the same knot in my stomach I had when I first arrived.  I was eventually able to go back to sleep, and forgot about it until early this morning on the train to work, where I think I had a flashback.  I smelled something, I can't put my finger on what it was, that triggered a memory of being out there.  Once again, nothing to specific, just desert.  I was concerned, but went to work regardless.  About an hour ago, I was jolted into another memory, where I could see the face of one of my buddies who get pretty seriously injured on patrol one day.  I was there, I could smell, hear, and see everything like it was actually happening live.  It lasted for about 5 seconds.

I've never had any psych issues while I was deployed or since I've returned.  And I don't want to.  I can't really talk to any of my friends about this, very few people know I was in the military and almost nobody knows that I was deployed, and I kind of want to keep it that way.

I tell them there is a kitten under their car and they freeze. I go around to the back of the car and see it under the tire.

First a little background.

A few months ago I approached police after becoming aware of a group of guys molesting kids. One of these people was a police officer (&amp; a senior one at that). I believe the investigation was a sham &amp; the matter is currently before an anti-corruption body.

I have since moved, but am convinced these people know where I live.  I am seriously concerned for my safety, and frankly, due to the seniority of the officer concerned, am not convinced I can rely on the current investigation into the police investigation.

Here's the thing. I have in my possession a recording of these people discussing having me killed (yes, I am serious). Unfortunately there is a hell of a lot of background noise &amp; it is unintelligible as a result. The initial investigating officer refused to look at it.

I have been looking around for quotes for forensic work. I can't afford it! I am broke (unemployed).

I realize this is an odd request, but if someone here could help me out with this (&amp; do the community a service as well), I would be very very thankful.

This is not some pathetic troll or conjob. I am serious, terrified &amp; desperate.

I have uploaded some snippets from the audio (as wav files), to a mediafire account. No malware, upload to virustotal if you wish.

http://www.mediafire.com/?wsim33rgx6h2x

If anyone can help me with cleaning these up... well I may just owe you my life, &amp; you may help nail some assholes in the process.

UPDATE - OK so people are asking how i came to know this info. Fair enough question. I will not lie, but please read this whole update and try to think rationally about it.

I have had serious psychological issues since i was a kid. When I was a child I sexually acted out against other children. Luckily their was intervention before any real damage was done. You can probably guess why I was acting out like that, I'm not going into that. Midway through university I had a nervous breakdown as I was still attracted to kids. I was diagnosed with severe Borderline Personality &amp; an anxiety disorder. I have self harmed many, many times (several overdoses), mainly due to my sexual issues. I became homeless a few years ago &amp; found accommodation in a ""group"" home. The house next door was managed by the same organisation. A guy next door ""Malcolm Sporle"", picked up on me somehow. I have no idea how, we just talked a few times about my general history. I thought at first I'd found someone who would really understand me - then he started revealing his history to me. The guy had been abusing kids since his 20's. I talked to someone I trust about what to do, &amp; was advised to anonymously tip off the cops after I moved into my own place (which I was already on the waiting list for). So there you go - I guess you could call me a ""pervert"", but I have NEVER acted out as an adult &amp; was repulsed by what this guy revealed to me. That's why I wen't to the cops. Please try to understand, I hate myself because of these feelings, &amp; as my dad said to me, in a way I felt I had something to prove (by going to the police). please try to understand these feeling are not my choice &amp; have ruined my life :(

UPDATE2 - Here's a screenshot of a blog post I saved about this guy before I went to the cops. It's now been taken down. it says EVERYTHING about him &amp; his mates.

http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/4581/72137588.jpg

UPDATE3 - OK thanks for those who are offering useful advise/trying to assist. Doesn't look hopeful as far as what I was initially after. To the amateur psychiatrists out there - I think the professionals I have been seeing for the last 10 odd years have a better idea about what's going on. Then again I know everyone online is an armchair expert.

UPDATE4 - OK so heres the link to the full, original wma file. As I've explained to those I pm'd it to - ""Full file is about 50mins, the part needing restoring is about the first 20mins. The only part that is clear (around 23:53), is where one of my former flatmate's gives ""Trevor"" (one of the pervs), the key to my door. These guys had been doing they're best to convince David/Mark whom I was living with that I was the molester. In fact, ""Trevor"" attempted to convince Mark to harm me. Pretty smart on their part, trying to get a guy with schizophrenia to harm me, even if something went wrong who would believe poor Mark? This Trevor guy defiantly also said, nearer the end of their conversation however that it was better to ""stay away from kids"", which with the rest of it, would screw them. If it is salvageable that is.

I had to leave Barrett (my BIG red mix-breed) at home by himself for a looooong day.

The people I was interviewing had several dogs at their house. A couple of really cool ones too. I played with the dogs a little as I was getting to know the family before the interview. I patted them on their heads. If they brought a toy, I threw it. No biggie.

Hours later, I get home from work. Even later than usual. (Went out bowling with friends after work). Barrett hears me and comes clomping across the living room, the swish of his tail audible, even in the dark. 

""Oh man, I'm so happy to see you Travis! This is, like, the best time ever! What are we going to do together? Are we going to go outside now? Maybe you could feed me first before we go out? Oh man, it's ok either way, I'm just so happy you're here!""

I put down my bag and reached to pet him, but before my hand could reach his head, Barrett froze.  

He stopped cold, halfway through a tail wag. 

I held perfectly still as he creeped in, sniffing me up one pants leg. Slowly. Deliberately. Then down the other, sniffing even more intensely. Then he took a step back, paused, and looked up at me with an expression I've seen just once before.

""You cheated on me, Travis. I know.""

He lowered his head and walked out of the room. Around the corner, I heard him lay down. He looked as utterly heartbroken as anyone could ever be. It's the saddest he's ever acted.

""Damn, dude...""

So I slide a bowl of food into his spot, and he comes meandering in, and eats unenthusiastically. 

As soon as he's done, I take him out back and after he does his thing, I pull his ball out of my pocket. (A knobby rubber one. His favorite!) His ears perk up. I throw it, he brings it back. I throw it again. He brings it back. He *always* brings it back...

We're a team! He's my big dog! He gets the ball, never poops in the house, and has the courage to walk up to all the pretty girls at the dog park so I can attempt a conversation. I feed him, pat him on the head at the appropriate times, and let him sleep in the bed on really cold nights. 

A few more throws, and my betrayal has been forgiven.

We come back inside and sit down. ""You my big dog, big guy?""
He walks over and lays his head in my lap. I scratch him behind the ears. 
""Yeah. You're my big dog...""

Back story: My parents met when they were 22, got married at 23, and had my older sister at 24 (1983). During their entire relationship, my mother would cheat on my dad if he did anything wrong - For example: ""You stayed late at work and left me with Daughter1, you're worthless."" And she would go find a boyfriend. 

My dad refused to leave her for 3 reasons: 1 - if he left, my mother would get custody over my sister and she would never let Dad see her. 2 - he was raised to believe that when you take your wedding vows, they are forever. 3 and probably the most important to this day - he was and is completely, head over hills, in love with her. 

He was never perfect, who is? He was late for everything and got mad a little things. But he did everything for us girls, and my mother. Nothing he ever did was good enough for her. So she left without fully leaving - she became a travelling nurse and moved around the country. I barely saw her during my teen years.

Back to now, I'm 23 and my sister is 28. We've both moved out. My Dad is still going out of his way to do everything, anything, whatever it takes to please my mother. He was late paying the phone bill this month and the phone company called her. She called Dad, screamed that she didn't need to deal with this, and hung up. Then, 4 hours later, sent him a text message saying, ""Why don't you love me?"" (Note: My dad and I are very close - we talk about everything.)

I was just on Facebook and saw that, like a stupid teenage girl, she changed her relationship status from ""Married"" to ""It's complicated.""

Honestly, I couldn't care less if they got divorced. I think it would be better for them both in the long run. My greatest fear is that Dad, who already suffers from severe depression (bet you can't guess why...), may hurt himself. I'm terrified. I live over an hour away, but I'm considering going to stay with him for a few days.

tl;dr: My mother is a horrible wife and broke up with my dad over nothing via Facebook.

I was lit up, and then pulled over. I put my window down, removed my keys from the ignition, put them on the dash, turned my cabin light on, and placed both my hands on the wheel. I asked the officer the reason why I was pulled over. I was asked by the officer if I was aware of the speed limit. I replied ""no comment"". I was told I was doing 57 in a 45. (I'm sure I was not speeding) I was asked for my license, registration and insurance. I told the officer I could not furnish my license. He inquired as to why I did not have it. I informed him that I had mistakenly left it at home in my wallet. I furnished my registration and insurance information. I was also asked for my DOB because I did not have my license. 

The officer left and then came back a short time later. He then stated that I needed to perform some tests for him. He then put his thumb and forefinger in a ring form and asked me to repeat his actions. He then proceeded to use his thumb to count from one to four via touching each of his digits with his thumb, and then from four to one until he got back to his forefinger. I was nervous. He asked me to complete this action three times. I did so without stumbling; without incident.

I also finished that task without incident. I was then asked to count backward from 79 to 43. I completed this task without incident as well. 

After that, I was asked to step out of the vehicle. I was asked if I knew why I was asked to step out of the vehicle. I told the office I did not know. The officer stated that he could smell alcohol in the vehicle. (I was coming back from the store with my brother who had purchased beer, but had not opened it. He did smell of alcohol as he had been drinking before we left for the store.) Next, I was asked by the officer to stand still and without moving follow the end of the officer's pen with my eyes. I completed this task without incident. The officer asked if I had had anything to drink. I told him that I had not had anything to drink, then corrected myself and stated that I could not drink, and explained my medical situation. The officer then stated that he had seen alcohol in the vehicle and asked if I was trying to hide anything as he had seen my brother putting beer under the seat. (There were not any open containers in my vehicle.)  I was then asked to stand on one foot with the other sticking up 6 inches from the ground and count ""1000-1, 1000-2"" and so on. I completed this task with out incident. I was then told I could leave. 

**No ticket or warning was issued for doing 57 in a 45.**

Three days later:
**Traffic Stop 2**

I was going to a friend's house, and had not noticed that I was doing 31 in a 25. I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed that there was an officer behind me. I slowed down. At the traffic light I noticed that the officer was looking down at his console. *Oh shit. He's pulling my plates.* I thought. I then turned onto the main city road. Once I had done that, I was lit up. I proceeded to turn into a restaurant parking lot. Next, I put my window down, removed my keys from the ignition, put them on the dash, turned my cabin light on, and placed both my hands on the wheel. The officer approached my vehicle with flashlight in hand and asked the following:

**""Sir, do you own this vehicle?""** *What!?*, I thought.

""Yes sir, I do."" I responded. 

He replied, ""I searched your plates, and the vehicle does not exist in the DMV database. Can I see your license and registration."" I furnished my license and registration. Once he saw my registration, he said that he had asked for my license to be run and that that was standard procedure. I replied that I understood. He stated that I probably was not in the database because I had just purchased the vehicle and that it takes time for that information to arrive at the DMV. (I registered the car 6 days before this stop.) He then proceeded to applaud by professionalism with the stop. He also stated that my ""mother should be proud"" and that I had been ""raised right"". After there were no hits after running my license, he said I was free to go.

**No mention was made of me doing 31 in a 25.**

**TL:DR Traffic Stop 1**: I was pulled over and had to do the Field Sobriety Test even though I can't drink, haven't drink in the past three years, and passed the first three test in my car with flying colors.

**TL:DR Traffic Stop 2**: I was pulled over and asked if I owned my own car.

In my third year in college, I was taking some difficult classes. I'm one of those people who loves to calculate my grade when I should be studying, so I did this often. When I got my grades back, I was shocked - there was no way I earned a 2.67. I asked all my professors what my grades on the final exams were, plugged that into the formulas, and realized that TWO out of THREE gave me a lower grade than they should've. My grades were corrected and I ended up with a 3.23 that quarter, which is about what I expected. And then, I was horrified. I was almost in my final year of school and realized that for three years, I had just accepted my grades without question. Professors are human, with hundreds of students to evaluate even when they're tired and want to get done so they can enjoy their breaks. I wish I had verified all my grades in all my classes from the start.

I have some paint cans, thinner, etc. at my house (I live in Southern California). I have about 30 cans of varying sizes ranging from one 5 gallon can down to the little 1 quart cans- it all fits into two medium sized moving boxes save the 5 gallon can. I want to dispose of them the correct and legal way. BUT, to do this, I either have to go to one of those e-waste/hazardous waste get-togethers that occur about once every 3-4 months and are usually about 20-30 miles from my place or I have to go to one of those permanent disposal facilities also about 30 miles away. OK, this sounds simple enough- but here's the rub. You can only transport up to 15 gallons at a time. As I mentioned I have more than that. Fine- I'll make two trips. But wait, you can only dispose of 4 items at a time. That means I'll have to make about 8 trips of about 60 miles (30 miles each way) to dispose of the waste that would only take up about 1/4 of my truck bed if I could legally take it all in one trip.

I would be happy to pay any dumping fees or excessive waste fees or whatever fees they want so that I can dump the stuff legally. But this just makes me want to bury it in my trash can under my regular trash just to get rid of it. I won't do that, but it makes me want to. 

Thanks for your time. If you have any recommendations for how to do this efficiently, I would be much obliged.

We found out my mom had cancer of the vulva almost 2 years ago. Everyone said that it wasn't serious that my mom was going to be fine so I moved out and my mom and I had a bit of a falling out. (I started to develop a addiction to opiates and I dated an abusive guy).

I dumped the boy and addiction and my mom and I started being okay again. She still resented me for leaving but we were okay. Now its been a year since we found out my mom had cancer. And it went into remission. 

I went to study at Job Corps. I had not yet obtained my GED and I took the Trade, Business Technology. With in the first week of me getting there, my mom finds a lump and she gets tested and figures out she has cancer again. I went to Job Corps for 7 month because i got told everything was fine. This was not serious at all.

I graduated March 23rd, about a month of me moving back home we find out the cancer was terminal. Stage 4 and all that. My mom looked fine though, they had to be mistaken! She had no hair at that point but she was fine. She had to have more then 2-7 months. 

My dad at that point had already taken all the paid leave that he could have and we needed his paycheck more then anything I could ever think of making. So I shouldered the responsibility. I am 20.

So at first my mom was fine but looking back at it she deteriorated fast. and I will not bore you with the details but she was pretty much lost her ability to communicate with us 3 weeks prior to her death and she lost her mobility about a month and a half before she passed.

So lets fast forward to about 4 days ago when I was watching my mom. She had been having some incredible days. I even got a nice picture of her smiling. She had been in a lot of pain lately though and was acting weird.

She then sneezed 3 times and started having a seizure and I realized she was bleeding out. She was bleeding from the tumor in her tummy. I freaked out and got my dad. I keep seeing that in my mind every time I see my mom.


Fast forward one more day. My dad wakes me up a 5am and tells me that my mom is gonna pass soon. I come down stairs and her eyes are rolling back in her head and she looks so scared and pale. There are tears brimming her eyes and she looks at me with almost pleading eyes. I looked into her eyes as she stops breathing. I can't get this image out of my head either.

So here we are today. 2 weeks before my 21st birthday, momless, and a little hopeless. I just needed to tell someone. Thank you for listening.

**Long story short** I helped take care of my mom and she is now gone and I am lost.

Hey Reddit. This is my first time posting anything on here. My boyfriend got me interested in this and I see that you guys give awesome advice a lot so I figured I would see if someone could give me some advice. My name is Jennie. I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer back in April. April 15th to be exact. My mom (whom I'm not speaking to anymore) told me that she was going to be taking care of my medical bills. When I was in my 3rd round of chemotherapy, she stopped working. Her boss told her that she had until September 17 to go to work or she would be fired. She never went, so I lost my health insurance. I have been done chemo since August, but I still get tests done, and I still have bills. She never told me that I had lost my insurance, and I had a surgery to get a port taken out. Also, there were collection jars around where she lives, (we live in different towns) and she was collecting the money and using it for herself. She told me that she was paying medical bills, but I called all of my doctors and no bills have been paid. A woman, donated 50,000 dollars for me to pay for schooling and medical bills. Her boss donated it, and my mom was using it to buy furniture for herself so they took the money back. As of right now, I have medical biulls to pay plus I need to pay for a surgery in full, and I have no health insurance because she decided not to go back to work. Im just looking for advice on what to do. She lives in Exeter so I went to Exeter police, and they sent me to norristown police. I called to state police and they sent me to norristown police, and the norisstown police are sending me back to exeter. No one wants to help but my mom has stolen money and committed fraud. I just need advice.

For anyone who wants to check the creadibility on this, Im not sure what you'll find. I had my treatment at Abington Memorial Hospital in Abington PA. I had some surgery done at Reading Hospital in Reading PA.

If anyone can tell me what another route to take would be, I would be so greatful. Im not trying to get my mom in jail, I just want my medical bills paid. Im only 18, I dont want the debt for this.


EDIT* I dont know how to show you guys that this is not a troll. I took my picture. You can clearly see I have no hair. I'll look for something around my house that will have written proof that I'm not lying.

ALSO Im not asking for money. I dont know if that helps but If I was trolling I would be asking for money. Im not. Just advice.

EDIT* For anyone who is looking up my name, here is the background on how I went from pregnant to cancer. (In yahoo answers) I was taking positive pregnancy test and the doctors didn't know why. They couldnt find a baby and the linning in my uterus was to thin to hold a baby so but they did see a mass on my left ovary. They set up surgery to remove the mass and an eptopic pregnancy but there was no eptopic pregnacy. The mass was a tumor and it was so large that my body thought I was pregnant and was producing the pregnancy hormone. I woke up from surgery and was told I have ovarian cancer.


EDIT* Im getting to everyone's comments as soon as I can. Im sorry for taking so long.

",justapuppetguy,511,232,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/pem38/hi_reddit_i_make_puppet_videos_and_my_puppets_are/,"A friend and I have been creating puppet [video blogs](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB68C543E6A2BCC74&amp;feature=plcp) for nearly a year now.  

The puppets have twitter accounts, and through twitter I noticed that a few people nominated us for the [#VideoBlogger category](http://shortyawards.com/category/videoblogger) and that we were in 31st place, just a few hundred votes behind Justin Bieber's DJ.

It seemed like an insignificant category as most people were going for [YouTubeStar](http://shortyawards.com/category/youtubestar) and other categories, so we figured it would be funny to [create a campaign video, to try and beat Bieber's DJ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=345_7NgPLx0&amp;feature=youtu.be).

But [Mr. DJ has 260,000+ followers](http://twitter.com/djtayjames), and we have just a [little over a thousand.](https://twitter.com/#!/fafagroundhog)  So we made [another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EC6zLtiGR5o), and actually took the lead.

This is when Bieber DJ decided to [fight back](https://twitter.com/#!/DJTayJames/status/165114423407689728) and actually [VOTED FOR HIMSELF,](https://twitter.com/#!/DJTayJames/status/165168879117668354) and offered to follow his ""Beliebers"" if they would vote for him. 

It's nearly impossible to stay with him, being that at any given point he is trading ""follows"" for votes, but we've been holding our own by releasing a new video every week.  [Our latest video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=P63T5ei9n68) sums up the whole story to date.  

So basically, we think it would be hilarious if a groundhog and a little red dude both knocked Justin Bieber's DJ off the top spot.  We don't have the numbers to do this, but I've seen Reddit do some amazing things.  

And if we do win, we plan to [sled down a mountain in a Porta Potty.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=345_7NgPLx0#t=189s)

 So if you have twitter, would you please **vote** for [Mario](http://shortyawards.com/MarioGlove) or [Fafa](http://shortyawards.com/FafaGroundhog)?

I am having an utterly shit day in work - it's a crazy busy day and a ton of our staff are out at a conference. I'm handling a ton of calls on my own and I'm totally swamped!

Next I hear a frantic ringing of our door bell - so I pop down to see who it is, and a well dressed guy in casual clothes is standing flustered on the doorstep.

""Hi can I help you?"" I asked,

""Oh... er... [*nervous laugh*] please.. yes... can you please, PLEASE help?"" he asked shyly

""Sure! Come on in and sit down!"" We're a charity, so sometimes we do get people on the doorstep in a crisis, so I didn't thing anything of someone needing to talk. I led him in and sat him down.

""What can I do for you? Are you ok?"" I asked wondering what the matter might be.

""I just.. er... "" he looked embarrassed, but his desperation overcame it. ""I work about two hours away from here.. but I live about 45 minutes drive in the opposite direction.."" he began.

""I tried to buy a train ticket to get home, but my card wouldn't work... and I could only afford to get as far as here and... er... I don't know how to get home.."" Despite clearly having worked here for a long time to sound native, the guy seemed like he might be from abroad since he seemed not to know how to get around too well. It's Northern Ireland, it doesn't take much to explore it, but it's a funny layout so it can take a while to get use to.

He continued; ""Well... I didn't know what to do, I just bought the ticket as far as I could go and that was here... does anyone in your office live where I live? Could I catch a ride home with someone? I could leave my laptop so you know I'll come back...""

I was flabbergasted - the guy thought he'd need to leave 'proof' that he wouldn't hurt someone for a lift home... I know we live in a scary world sometimes, but that was just unbelievable... 

""You seem - very understandably stressed out!"" I said -""Would you like a cup of tea? coffee?""

""Erm, I'd like a glass of water if that's ok?""

""Sure - By the way, home much is it to get home?""

""Oh.. erm... £6.50"" he looked embarrassed again in case I'd assumed he thought I was thinking he wanted to ask for money.

I got him a glass of water and checked my purse. As if it was meant to be, I had 6 pounds 60 pence in my wallet. I brought it to him.

""Here - it's your lucky day! I just had enough."" I smiled.

He looked genuinely shocked, ""Thank you... thanks... I'll bring it back tomorrow, I'll stop here on the way home.... My girlfriend normally has the car, but it's not working lately...""

""No, not at all, no need... they say something in Mexico (REDDIT lol) that I've always liked... ""Today you, tomorrow me""... So Next time you can help someone pretend it's me!""

""What's your name by the way?""

""Jennifer""

""I'm Tony""

""I'm sure we'll meet again Tony - Good luck, get home safe and enjoy that beautiful sunshine!"" 

""Yeah... thank you - thanks""

He left, but I was pleased that I finally got to help someone... I guess it's a tiny little assistance and it's not like I gave someone on a motorway shoulder a tire, but it made me feel really good that I got to take a break from my day to help him out when he was clearly so scared about how to get home... It made me all the sadder to think that he may have already experienced treatment that made him think because he may not look or be native that he couldn't get that help.

Least I got to do something nice. Brightened my day. Just wanted to share. =)

My daughter is the small percent that didn't respond to the treatment, her doctor at one point told her she probably will be dead in ten years, eight years ago. 

She's fine. I want her to live life to her fullest and she does. She has a wonderful partner and they travel and enjoy everyday.

He mentioned he had a tax exempt card, and he just needed to find it. So he got out this big ass wallet and started looking. I didn't really mind, I went back to stocking the bags at my register.

Suddenly this other customer walked up with a bag of charcoal. I could tell be looking at the guy he was off. I'm certain he had some mental issues. He set his bag of charcoal down *in front of* customer 1. Closer to my register. Customer 1 didn't say anything, he was still looking through his wallet so I figured customer 2 must be his son or something.

I work in the Lawn and Garden department, so my register is sort of at the end of the store, so he turned around and ran back to the store, towards the front registers. I mean RUNNING! I was so confused! Customer 1 was still looking through his wallet (It was a HUGE wallet and the tax exempt card is just a small piece of paper). He still didn't say anything.

I tried reasoning it out in my head, I figured Customer 2 definitely had some mental issues, and I figured he was just getting his dad a cart or something. 

Get this: He came back a minute later empty handed! He walked up the the register all casual, and Customer 1 allowed him to check out in front of him, still looking for his card. The guy bought his charcoal no problem, and then left.

Customer 1 finally found his card and looked up and asked where his stuff went. I asked him if he knew Customer 2 and he said no, just didn't want to hold the guy up. I was flabbergasted, I didn't know what to think. I was trying to reason it out and figure out what the hell the guy did with his stuff. No one had any idea where the guy ran to when he ran back into the store or what the heck he did with Customer 1's stuff! We just re-shopped for him and he paid for it and went on his way. It was the strangest thing. Some other customers ended up behind Customer 1 by this point and they were just as confused as I was. 

It was a weird day.

All of a sudden, I hear the slamming of a cardoor and shouts from the street. A little girl, I recognize her as my neighbor from the building next door, is frantically repeating, ""Give it back, give it back mommy, give back my book!"" After a couple minutes I turn around to investigate and promptly see this girl's mother holding her book not three inches in front of her daughter's face essentially leading/taunting her to the door. As they reach the sidewalk, without missing a beat, the mother drops the book on the ground and continues to the door with every bit of ""immature"" written all over her. The girl stops, huffs, grabs her coloring book, and continues on her way. 

Now, I wouldn't be so terribly infuriated if not for the fact that this family is pure and simple ignorance.

It started off just walking together from one terminal to another but - realizing we liked each other's company - become the wait for the flight, and then finally we got her seat swapped so that we could sit next to each other the entire flight. We talked for several hours, and then there was a moment where we looked into one another's eyes and i knew it - I was totally head over heels for her, and - i strongly believe - she liked me just as much. 

The problem: I'm married with kids - and a good home life to boot. And though nothing happened (ok, she fell asleep on my shoulder), a deep part of me wishes it had. Since I've gotten home, my stomach is in knots, I can't focus, I think about her constantly. I haven't felt like this since I was 14 and had a crush on my best friend's 17 year-old sister. And while I am happy to say that I was faithful (physically) - not kissing her on one of the many, many opportunities i had the chance to will be one of the things i regret most in this life. 

This has struck me to my core. This person that I spent 8 hours(!) with, I would give deep consideration to leaving the life that I have spent 12 years building. I know this is a head/heart issue. My head cries, ""Dumbass!"" and my heart cries, ""Destiny!"" And I feel alive and crushed at the same time. 

And I tell myself that it's not - and can't be - love. That love flowers over time, and what I am feeling are just those initial neurochemical poison darts that just say, ""Hey, you guys dig each other, that's beautiful baby."" But still, but still, but still...

My wife knows none of this. I love her and two weeks ago, I would have said that there was no one else in the world for me but her. But that feels like a lifetime ago, and here i am now completely at sea. 

I don't know if I am looking for advice, or pity, or angry ravings about my lack of fidelity - knowing you guys, I'll get all three. But I needed to say it out loud, since the one person that holds the rest of my secrets is the one person I can't talk to. 

tl;dr I accidentally fell in love with a woman other than my wife. fuck.

**EDIT:** Thank you, all of you. I think the first and most important thing i needed was just to get this off of my chest. Seeing your responses - both positive and negative - was refreshing and helped clear my head. 

Just to be clear - I do love my wife, and there is no question as to where my loyalty lies. But you sit with a problem long enough by yourself and you start second-guessing answers that you know are right all along. Add in the difficulty your own emotions being entangled in the problem, and it quickly becomes a pea soup of ""Does this mean something?"", ""What should I do?"", and ""How can i trust what I am thinking/feeling?""

Not so anymore. Americans tend to celebrate and rally behind the dumbest people they can find. They seem endeared by stupidity and drawn to it...perhaps they relate to it just a bit too much?

Regardless, the idea of idiocracy isn't funny anymore since it's become reality.

[It even got bestof'd](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/1jyai7/coochiesmoocher_explains_the_psychological/). Many thought it was an accurate portrayal of middle life. Some thought it was complete rubbish. The one sentiment I saw expressed over and over was depression.

I didn't set out to say that getting older is terrible. I was just giving the OP a few things to think about vis-a-vis his parents. I'd like to share a couple points about middle age that will raise your spirits and invite other mid-lifers to do the same.

For me personally, my mid-40s are the best time of my life. My wife [owns her own business](http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/12u3kk/my_wifes_most_recent_interior_design_job_a_large/), my kids are healthy and beautiful, I have a great house, working vehicles, and my back porch - whoa. That place is the shit. It took years to get that porch to where it is now but it's finally coming together the way I wanted. I just love sitting on the porch on a cool evening and just watch the trees sway in the breeze.

I work from home making a decent salary so I get to take my kids to day care, the doctor, and even visit them for lunch occasionally. My schedule is flexible so I can just about come and go as I please. The company I work for is growing fast and I can see great things coming down the pipe.

A couple years ago I got a trainer to help me get in shape. Within a few months of working out and changing my diet I was in the best shape of my life! These days I don't worry too much about being competition-ready but I haven't let myself go... too far.

After the kids go to bed I watch a TV show with my wife or maybe play EVE Online if she has something else to do. I have a kegerator, so I can pour a cold mug of beer anytime I want. We live in a great neighborhood and many of the neighbors are friends. We regularly get together at different people's houses to let the kids play and the adults get to have a cocktail and chat.

Of course I've been through stuff. Some of the things I talked about in my original comment I do think about. The decade of my 20's was probably the most difficult time of my life. [My mom is gone](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/yr0ap/my_grandmother_insists_on_calling_newspapers/c5y3inz) but my dad is doing well for now. My brother and I don't talk but we don't hate each other. I pay a ton of child support for two older children. I look back at my life and [wish I'd finished college and become a fighter pilot](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1jkfnu/what_phase_did_you_go_through_when_you_were/cbfqx37) like I always dreamed. 

The truth is: Dreams change. Goals change. You learn more about life and your limitations, then you adapt and move down a different path. There are going to be times when you're upset about where you've been and the direction you're heading, but you pick yourself up and chart a new course. Things change, you change. Take those changes, bring them close, and make them work for you. Be happy.

I call him and he promptly explains that it would have been better had I just read about his death. I explain that the past is exactly where it needs to be and that I hold no ill feelings and say good-bye.

One month later he calls and we begin our relationship for the first time. It starts with him simply saying, ""I'm sorry.""

He died 5 years ago today, one year after we began our father-daughter relationship. I have no regrets, no resentment and no demons.

I hate my job, denied an ultimatum, and will probably be fired. (just a meaningless rant)",Just_Venting,413,147,189,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/qft07/i_hate_my_job_denied_an_ultimatum_and_will/,"I've hated my job and employer for a long time.  I've always gone to work, done more than was ever asked of me, took up new responsibilities, improved the way several things were done, saved them a lot of money on several occasions, etc.  Not 1 sick day at all. I even keep my mouth shut about their borderline following of the employement laws (looks o.k. on paper, not always so much in practice).

Last fall they gave me less than a day's notice of when I had to come in on a Saturday (I work M-F; 15 hours notice actually).  I did it, but I told them I wouldn't do that again.  I made it very clear in an e-mail to several managers and HR.  No one said anything about it.  Fast forward to last night.  They've known for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or 2 that they would need someone later today during my shift.

My immediate supervisor told me I had to come in and I told him no one told me, so I wasn't.  I told him no one gave me prior notice of having to work.  His response: ""We're not required ot give you notice"".  Legally true.  My response: ""I require notice"". His reply ""You work when we tell you.  If you don't show up there will be consequences."".  He didn't apologize for his failure to do his job and set a schedule and ask me to come in.  Simply owning up to his mistake would have probably gotten me to agree.  His horrible managing skills are why so many quit anyways.


I'm sick of ""shutting up and being grateful to have a job"", which is what everyone has always told me any time I complain about my job or where I work.  Somewhere a line has to be drawn and you have to make a decision about self-respect; take a stand.  I may be replaceable, but I doubt they will ever find someone that will do as much as I did above and beyond what was asked of me.  I had enough respect to do all that I did for them and if they can't respect me enough to do the only thing I asked of them, it's not a place I want to work anyways.  I can't help but think that if I were a single mother who had to take care of her kids on the weekend, they would have told me far in advance, if not gotten someone else to do it altogether.  My time is just as valuable to me as anyone else's is to them so I should be afforded the same thing.

/rant



**Edit**: I didn't expect anyone to read this, let alone reply.  I just expected it to be a therapeutic rant that would get buried.  That said, let me clarify a few things:

* I have enough money saved up for a couple of months, so getting fired will not be a heavy sting.  The company also pays 2 weeks late (this weeks pay was for the work I did 2 weeks ago), so I would still get 2 more weeks pay.

* It's a small trucking company, I just happen to work in the office.  I would not ever consider using anyone there as a reference.  They get all new employees first from a temp agency and hire them on after several months.  It will take them 2-3 weeks to get a replacement for my position anywhere near up to speed (assuming the person doesn't quit).

* My supervisor does not set a schedule as some other jobs do.  I have a set shift that never changes, M-F.  They don't normally operate on the weekends unless certain manufacturing plants are operating (sometimes 2-3 times a month, sometimes they will go over a month without working a weekend, and then only Saturdays).  It's at that time that management is supposed to decide who is working those days and inform them.  Even then they can't seem to get it right.  A couple of months ago they just told the lady that does what I do, but on 1st shift, to decide.  That pissed me off.  There are 2 managers there that are supposed to do that and neither of them can do such a simple thing?

* They require ""as much notice as possible"" for any employee who wants a day off.  I think asking for 24 hours notice is reasonable.

* I work 8-9 hours per day, on average, with no meal breaks.  They claim they aren't required because I have a desk job, but I'm the only person in the front office during my shift and people are coming in and going out all the time, phones are ringing, e-mails, paperwork, dealing with truckers; the only time I ever find time to even eat anything is around an hour before I leave.  Sometimes there isn't any time at all.  Company policy states I am to get two 10 minute breaks, paid, per shift.  There is never anyone there to cover that, so I have never gotten one.

* Unemployment pay is not a factor in my decision.  I think I would probably get it (I've never lost an appeal in the past), but it's not my concern at the moment.  I'm not an idiot.  I have everything documented in e-mail.  And saved just in case I need it.

For the skeptics: I know this is a controversial issue, and it is not nearly as black and white as the media has portrayed. My issue, however, is  that the administration has been so uncompromising in the policy's implementation - especially considering that it is based on opinion and qualitative survey responses (I have included the references provided by the school board below).

It is also worth nothing that I have received a lot of (anonymous/confidential) support from current teachers.

This is how I'm getting over it.

* **Music is your best friend or your worst enemy.** All of those songs on your computer are going to stick with you through this breakup. You can hit shuffle and find something that you love and it'll love you right back. Beware though, you've got a lot of tunes that might break you down to the lowest form. I've found that Will Smith is your best choice for any and all occasions. Just keep in mind that ""Just the Two of Us"" is about Jaden not Jada and you're good. It's hard not to be happy when ""Wild Wild West"" is on. Play it louder than hell.

* **You have friends.** Your friends are right there. They want to help you. Your single friends think you're better off. Your taken friends feel bad for you. Hang out with your single friends. They will show you what you've been missing out on.

* **Go out.** Go. Nobody is going to take you out. Nobody is going to make you leave the cave of moping that your bedroom has become. You are your own event planner. Go wild. Line things up. Concerts. UFC at the bar. Parties. Whatever floats your boat. Just go do something. You used to go out and not think about your then girlfriend. You still can. It feels good and will take your mind off it. Sitting at home is not good for you or anyone. 

* **Drink.** Buy yourself a handle of something you might not typically drink. Maybe something a little too expensive for a normal week. Have a cocktail or two and ease your nerves. Don't overdo it like an asshole. Nobody likes that person. 

* **Hook up with something random.** This is for confidence. Go out. Find somebody cute and go for it. If you succeed your confidence will grow exponentially. No more thinking you're just some piece of shit. No. Now you're Don Juan and you know it. Even if it's just some smooching, you know that you've still got it. You have your groove back.

* **Don't post your sob stories on social media.** Nobody fucking cares about your sad-sack status update on facebook. Nobody wants to be friends with some mopey cry-baby. Express yourself in person to friends. Want to post something on facebook or twitter? Make it awesome. Show people that you're awesome. Fake it til you make it.

* **Enjoy the weight loss.** Your appetite might be screwed because you're so sad. Whatever. Turn it into something good. Throw those weights around and use it to your advantage. Pretend like you're cutting weight for the big fight coming up. You'll look awesome. You'll feel awesome.

* **Grow a beard.** Because fuck you.

* **Don't contact your ex.** Just leave it alone. You know that it's only going to make you feel like crap. You want it to be different. It's not. Just leave them alone. If they want you back*, they'll contact you. Even then, be wary. They dumped you. Just because they're having second thoughts doesn't mean they wont just dump you again in a week.

This is how I'm doing it. There are hard days and there are good days.

I hadn't been able to find work locally, still can't, and was set to go to College in May and at the rate I was going, I was going to be homeless by April and be screwed. So I tried to freelance, and you know, I made *some* money but not all too much. Just enough to pay off my credit card for the stuff I needed to buy to make this crappy motel room livable.

Into my second and final month of rent that I have settled, I got the miracle I needed. I scored a contract that pays for all of April and will be recurring every month. 

Fucking. Finally. I was so afraid I wouldn't get lucky, that I'd get screwed and need to either live on the street or go crawling back home and be a college drop out before I ever began. Trap myself back in a home and environment I so dearly hated. 

Things are different now. Everything is different. My goals, my plans, my future are all possible now. 

I can't even describe what I'm feeling. This is the first time in my life that something has gone in my favour. After almost 19 years, chronic illness, a shitty childhood, horrific parents, and an extreme lack of friends and self-identity, things are pointing in my favour now. 

Posting it to this sub-reddit because honestly, I have no one else to tell right now and I need to tell *someone*. Who better than thousands of strangers on the internet that have no context? I'm sure I can break the news to the friends I've made since I began giving a damn in June soon. When they wake up or are available. God damn.

I have beaten my weight problem, after reconciling my atheism and fear of death my anxiety and depression are gone, my abusive junkie mother is dead and I have about 20 grand in the bank after paying off all my debt. Problems just splash around my ankles and drift away after what I have conquered. 

I think I may actually be the most confident well adjusted person alive, I feel like I am leagues beyond everyone I come in contact with emotionally and mentally. ( Edit: Should I have added a wink, nudge-nudge to this? It's hard saying things without body language.)

**Edit: By popular demand, my story... (Please in advance forgive me my grammatical errors)**

I am a Irish-American male. I grew up in the suburbs of south eastern MA, my family was actually very wealthy and affluent in the prior generation but some drug abuse as well as a few untimely deaths lead to a quick decline. My father ditched at an early age (like 6 months old) and is somewhere in southern Florida with a forearm full of some choice Columbian contraband I'm sure but thats neither here nor there. He couldn't do much damage while he wasn't around. My mother on the other hand *could* do damage, and damage she did.

I was raised by a computer screen and used food to comfort myself, my mother was an opiate addict, a drunk and a child. She used to go into fits of drug induced rage and beat my step father to a bloody pulp, I used to try and push her off and help him hold her down and calm her while she scratched at our faces and screamed like a banshee. It must have looked much like an exorcism. Another thing my mother was very good at was guilt, she would tell me and my sisters that life was bad because of us and that she had to sacrifice her happiness so we could eat. 

I was not *crazy* fat but I was fat [enough](http://imgur.com/vnhYX.jpg) and awkward enough to merit torture from children my age throughout my public school career. Since everywhere I turned in my real life was painful I became really anti-social and lived through the interwebs and blizzard entertainments fine products.

Fast forward a few years...

At about 15 I realized I had been lied to my entire life and that no happy shiny man in the sky had a plan to make everything worth it. Key horrible mind numbing depression/nihilism. Also being the only atheist I knew, I began to develop the feeling that I was alone. That every other person on the planet was an absolute fool. For the next three or four years I drowned myself in [philosophy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLrMVous0Ac) , [pseudo science](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYB0VW5x8fI) , [amazing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfbOyw3CT6A) things and anything I could wrap my brain around to add meaning to life and existence.

Fast forward--------------------Loved and lost---------------------Fast forward

The fear of death was the hardest thing to deal with, and I don't quite know how I did. I eventually just accepted that reality was so fascinatingly, mindbogglingly strange that it was worth being here no matter what. By now I had been in the army national guard for a few years so boot camp, as well as the lifestyle, had cured me of my excess [matter](http://imgur.com/NsggI.jpg).

I volunteered for deployment since in the national guard if you want the best education benefits you need to go to war at least once. I have been on a regular exercise regimen, taking dietary supplements, paid off all my debt and saved a boatload of money.

Me: ""Let me get my shoes on.""

I head over to where the cat was seen, and the two cops are waiting there and ask what any decent person would: how long it was missing, was it a boy or a girl, is it an indoor/outdoor cat.

I was even more surprised when one of the cops helped me look for ten minutes and spoke with a few of the neighbors, asking them to keep an eye out for my cat.

I haven't found her yet, but nearly wept when I said goodbye to the officer.

Here is a list of 'open access' journals, I would imagine that the rate of scientific and technological progress would just be astronomical if we could drop these barriers to knowledge. 

Why does an advertising based revenue model fail for scientific literature? Why would scientists not boycott any publication, regardless of prestige, which would not share their work to the public? What is the benefit of this?

As a non-scientist, I'd really like to know everyone's thoughts on this, but seems a strange way to run the journals, central as they are to scientific progress. How much do the editors need to get paid for the work they do? Are the journals really driven as profit making entities?

I put my hand up and admit I know nothing about the scientific publishing world, but just find it surprising when I'm looking into a specific area and have to pay $$ for a single pdf. How is this justified?

Why does everyone not use a model as seen here, ""Open Access"" journals. Why isn't this the de-facto standard for academic publications? 

Honestly, I'd love to know and stand to be educated on why this is so.

Someone bought up the land around it and eventually the site of the cemetery then the county bisected the site with a road, digging up many graves in the process. 

I was told by the local Black History museum that the land had over 100 people buried there. There are now 17 that are still visible, 2 of which are WWI Veterans. Many of the above ground tombs have been broken into and several of the regular grave sites have been dug up entirely. The family that owns the land the cemetery is on has said that he isn't preventing the families from visiting, but he's considering putting up a fence to prevent people form accessing the property. 

[Here](http://www.wesh.com/news/central-florida/volusia-county/Neglected-cemetery-left-in-ruins-by-vandals/-/12983450/19144046/-/pk6wd5z/-/index.html) is the link to the media coverage I got for the site today. I called the local news channel and had a correspondent meet me there. At least it's gotten that far. 

The families have expressed to me that they have absolutely been prevented from visiting the site for over 15 years. They took this all the way to the State Capital and were turned down there as well. They just want to have the remaining bodies exhumed and reburied at a cemetery. 

What can I do legally to help the families? 

UPDATE: I found new info, so here's a bit of an update for those of you interested.

Oaklynn Cemetery was created in 1929 for use as an African-American burial area. Apparently the other local cemetery was asking too much money for their plots so this was the only other option at the time. Anyway, the land has obviously changed hands several times over the years, but originally the land was described as being square and ""470 feet on each side."" At some point the county built a road through the lower southwest corner of the site, though there is some speculation as to whether or not anyone was buried in that area at the time. The county has said that there were over 300 plots on the property but only 26 were documented, so there could very well be a lot more graves, we just don't know. The first burial happened in 1929, the final burial (documented) was in 1969. There are 3 Veterans buried there, 2 WWI vets, and a WWII vet. 

I've written an email to the Mayor, and several to various state organizations and I'm considering writing the Governor. The owner of the property has gone on record saying he wants to put up a fence to keep everyone out. According to Chapter 497 of the Florida Statutes, he is required by law to maintain the site, despite whether he knows it or not. 


I'm still fighting this battle, guys. It's just going to take a little more time than I thought. I'll update again when info becomes available. 

UPDATE Mark II: I contacted the Veterans of Foreign Wars today and they were a little more than pissed that 3 of their own were laying in the middle of the woods somewhere. The story has been passed to a Veteran that's running for president of the VFW and I have it on their authority that something will definitely be done. What and when are still a question, but I think I've done all I can at this point. 

I'm currently sitting at the local police department waiting on the Deputy I spoke with earlier to come talk to me about what will be happening next as far as the city is concerned, so here's hoping something good will come of this sooner rather than later. 

**UPDATE**

[This](https://sites.google.com/a/oaklynncemetery.com/oaklynn-cemetery/home) is the link to the new website that has been put together for the cemetery. It's in it's infancy, but there is a decent bit of info there if you're interested. Please share the link, especially if you live in Florida. 

The landowner, after granting permission to go in and restore the site is now saying that the families now have to show proof that they have family in the cemetery and they're only permitted to clean off the graves of their own family members. The problem here is that there is at least 50 years of pine straw and tree debris covering the full 6 acres of property. For anyone to know *exactly* where their family members are is impossible. We found 4 graves we didn't even know were there at the entrance of the site yesterday afternoon under 9 inches of soil. The more people we can get on board with this, the easier it will be to restore Oaklynn Cemetery.

Like countless others, I have no idea what to write here to avoid being downvoted like crazy. I haven't cracked the magic formula despite lurking for six years and posting sporadically for the last four.

I am in a moment of need, however, so please bare with me as I hope my cake day status will grant me a moment of your time.

In less than 33 hours, a [Kickstarter game project](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/vigeant/do-move-say-0) I worked very hard on will expire and there's a good chance that it will not reach it's goal - almost $4K is still needed.

Let's start with some videos.

* [Play-testing compilation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wR2Rq3lvxw)
* [Union Square play session from a couple weeks ago](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBthNjfXK8s)
* [Me acting silly in Union Square](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6aShAFJb6w)

The game is called Do Move Say, a live-action card game for 10 to 40 players. Past players have called it the Apples to Apples of live action gaming, since it's incredibly accessible and you can pick up and play in less than five minutes.

The game was inspired by Chris Hecker's Spy Party, and has the support of some of my mentors in gaming like Eric Zimmerman, Frank Lantz (creator of Drop7), Greg Trefry (Come Out and Play) and Nick Fortugno (Playmatics)... as well as [these people](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/594084262/pants-by-bluff-works/posts) that [blogged about it](http://derbswords.tumblr.com/post/27371295645/do-as-i-do-and-move-says-i) or [wrote about it](http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/725530/nerdsourcing-trial-of-the-clone-super-retro-squad-do-say-move/) purely in support of the project (in other words, I have no idea who they are but love that they support me). 

* There's a $5 Print and Play option and the full game with all mods is $25 (which includes shipping and handling anywhere in the US). $5 extra bucks gets you shipping across the entire planet.
* The game is production ready and we'll have the files to a printer on Wednesday (if this goes through) so we can have high-quality plastic-coated cards, similar to standard Bicycle playing cards. The price and goal may seem a little high, only because these cards cannot have be compromised in quality - players handle the cards for an entire game, so they must be durable, strong and resistant to sweaty palms.
* I've been testing this for over a year and a half with hundreds of players, both at festivals and private game tests. In addition, I have sent dozens of copies to camps and other groups for ""blind"" play testing and it's been a great hit.

So all I ask is for you to check out the [project](http://www.domovesay.com) and pledge if you're interested. If you're not interested, maybe you know someone that would be - like an educator, a theater professional, a camp director, a LARPer...

Thanks so much.

**Update #1**
25 hours to go. Since I wrote this post, nearly $1,000 has been pledged. I have $3,000 to go!

I estimate that I'll need about 100 more backers, as my average pledge is about $31. Thank you so much for helping me get this far!


**Update #2**
10 hours to go. $2,500 still needed. There are almost 400 pledgers, though, which is really awesome!

I never realized how much money was just disappearing every month and going straight to credit cards.

Finally, she asked if my wife was doing this on her own (i.e. paying for it out of pocket) which she was.  The lady then said good luck and that was that.

After the copies were done the wife and I went to look at something else in the store and then the lady came over and said, ""I paid for your copies for you.  Good luck this year!""

It came out to about $30 which is a good amount of money for: copies; a teacher; the spouse of a broke-ass grad student.

Things have been going pretty well. We share a lot of interests and we have good sex. It is nice.  I haven't dated for quite a few years and at first I said to myself ""how silly it was to deny myself this? I should have been more aggressive years ago""


But today I remembered why. I haven't heard from this girl for about 5 hours (and still haven't) and started to get progressively more concerned. I sent a phone, text, and email with no response, and was getting progressively more paranoid about what she might be doing and if it meant she would reject me. I started wondering if she was on a date with someone else and I pulled up her match.com profile to see when she had last logged in. I started to have a physical reaction as well. That is when it clicked that something was off.

So I started clicking through wikipedia and looked at ""codependency"" (not sure if it is quite that) and specifically the ""low self-esteem [patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency#Patterns_and_characteristics)"".  

It isn't the first time I've realized that i have a self-esteem problem, but it is the first time I realized that my general need to feel superior to others was at the core of it. I seek approval while not wanting people to know that. I show indecision, perfectionism, and definitely have difficulty setting priorities even when I intellectually know that I am making a mistake. 

This is when I had that moment of clarity and realized that I was allowing my own ""esteem"" to depend on outside factors. I was (am) allowing my achievements, the approval of others, and my ability to make myself feel ""superior"" to others drive my ability to happy. I was allowing self-esteem to be the ""variable"" in the equation. I suddenly realized that those with high self-esteems have their high value as ""fixed"" in that equation, and therefore actions should follow from the person's status as a valuable, lovable person. For example: I would previously think that if I didn't eat right or didn't exercise that would mean I am worse of a person (again, making that the variable). Instead, by assuming you are an amazing person, you should make decisions worthy of such a valuable person. Get it? I *think* I believe it.

So back to me and this girl. Maybe we will end up being right for each other, maybe she will dump me tomorrow. I am trying to continually know that my value is not dependant on that outcome. If nothing else, her involvement in my life helped me realize what I have tried to describe in this post.

While some of the gripes have been legitimate, I think redditors who have never cycled in traffic don't fully understand what urban cyclists go through, causing you to blame us for things we can't control. So I wanted to share some events from my fairly typical 4 mile bike commute through downtown DC today:

1. On a 3 lane one way street. There doesn't happen to be any vehicle traffic at this time. I approach an intersection where I have a green light. A horde of pedestrians decides to cross the street right in front of me, even though I have a green light and they have a don't cross sign. I slam on my brakes, barely stop in time, and smile at them politely. None of them seemed to see anything wrong with the situation. Indeed some looked at me as if *I* had done something wrong.

2. 45 seconds later on that same street. Right lane is full of parked cars. Middle lane has two illegally double-parked vans in it directly in front of me. Left lane has lots of high speed vehicle traffic approaching from the rear. There's a sizeable gap between the illegally double parked vans and the parked cars, so I decide there's no reason to hold up car traffic. Instead, I ride slowly through that gap, keeping a close eye out for drivers opening doors and pedestrians sneaking through. As I am just getting past the second double-parked van, a vehicle turning right into a driveway from the left lane at about 25 mph comes within inches of hitting me. I avoid an accident only by swerving wildly onto the sidewalk. I look back-- it's the first double-parked van - the driver swung around the vehicle parked in front of him and made a blind, high-speed right turn directly into me. Then he slammed on the horn and told me to watch where I was going.

3. A few minutes later on a different, two way street, 2 lanes each way. I'm in the right lane. A car is in front of me, stopped at a red light with a right blinker on. I'm going straight, and since I don't want to get hit by that car when it turns right, or any other car turning right, I wait behind it in the center of the right lane. An SUV coming the other direction down the road makes an illegal, middle of the block U turn and tries to fit behind me, but he doesn't have space to make the U turn, so his car is perpendicular to the direction of traffic. He decides to blame me for his illegal maneuver and honks at me repeatedly, motioning me to cut around to the right of the car in front of me. I do my best charade rendition of ""I don't want to get hit when that idiot turns right without looking, and maybe you should have thought of this before you made the illegal U-turn"" but I'm not sure the message gets across.

Like I said, this was all during a single, fairly typical 4 mile commute, of which all but around a mile took place in bike lanes. I'm sure everyone who rides in a city has similar stories. The point is, no matter what we do, right or wrong, someone is going to criticize us and maybe almost kill us. So that tends to lead to something of a lack of patience for driver complaints about cyclist behavior.",,False,,t5_2qh96,False,,,True,t3_dw5a1,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dw5a1/always_in_the_wrong_place_in_partial_defense_of/,

1371494509.0,258,self.self,1gj57q,Two years ago I did an AMA on my chocolate chip cookies – I was inspired by redditors’ feedback and today we’re shipping thousands of pounds a week! Thank you-- here’s an update!,begreen123,342,84,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gj57q/two_years_ago_i_did_an_ama_on_my_chocolate_chip/,"I’m Bart Greenhut, the modern day cookie monster.

When MY former, favorite cookie, the ORIGINAL Famous Amos sold out to a large corporation (late 1980’s,) the the Keebler elves pulled a switcheroo and the previously delicious cookies transformed into bland, oversweet, masses of dough. (my opinion) 

I did an AMA in 2011. I'm doing this AMA as an update and so that I can answer any questions you may have about being in business or starting your own company.

So, here’s a little guide on how to succeed without selling out!

Lots of redditors’ responded to my story. BUT, the real benefit to me was *the how the positive feedback actually inspired me to continue. *  Per redditor suggestions: we improved our cookies; made them a little less well-done and a little larger, made buying them through our website easier and, upgraded shipping to USPS Priority instead of 3rd Class mail.  ***ALL THESE CHANGES and more, WERE THANKS TO REDDIT feedback and inspiration!***

Through 2011 we continued to perfect our cookies while adding distribution to about 100 more, mainly natural food stores, in California. All of this led up to BIG changes in 2012…

Normally, we write Resolutions during new year’s eve dinner, however, in 2011 I felt I needed to postpone until we could get away from the daily chaos. 

So in May, 2012, Judy and I wrote new year’s resolutions in Paris! 

At the time of my original reddit AMA I didn’t seriously considered expanding because I was fearful that the reality would somehow end up crushing my vision.  *** I mean, even Ben and Jerry, former paradigms of idealism sold out!***

The feedback I received from redditors’ opened my eyes to new possibilities. 

We knew people loved our cookies, however, sub-consciously, I always factor-in that 12 years earlier, I had survived a rare disease and I was already older than my father was when he died.

MY big question was whether I had it in me to essentially begin a new career at an age when most people were winding down.

My advice to many redditors’ two years ago was to **“march fearlessly into the future,”** –I realized at that moment that I would be a hypocrite (and not very proud) if I let my fear get in the way of heeding my own advise! 

Judy's question to me was; what would I enjoy most? That was easy,***propagating happiness, through our cookies, for as long as possible!*** That’s when Judy and I decided to go “all-in”.

***“The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies In The World” is much more than a provocative brand name and it’s not hype, we take it seriously.*** 

We are committed to always be true to our ideals, so we always make sure that we earn our name. So, in June we began taste-testing top-in-class ingredients from around the world. Our study concluded in August and since August we’ve used only ***Belgian Chocolate*** (hands down the best) and ***French Butter*** (also, hands down the best) blended with our favorite American Butter . *Today, I believe that it’s virtually impossible for anybody, to qualitatively surpass our cookies. * Some people think we’re nuts. We know we’re not normal. 

Our business plan isn’t normal either:  ***“Spread happiness, control everything, consider every decision as to its implication on our mission, provide only the best to our customers and, never exceed our means.”***

Today, growing any business is a challenge. We are lucky to have long-term, trusted employees, great suppliers, own our own equipment and produce everything in house. Inventory soaks up cash so we bake-to-order, and ship fresh. Much better for cookie-lovers and gives us an important distinction in the marketplace. 

***I believe that the enemy of every idealistic enterprise is needing outside money.*** To most investors, money implies control. Investors are interested in short term ROI not changing the world. We do our best to insulate ourselves from needing outside money. That way, no one can pull our strings. ***When we wanted to introduce a superior gluten-free, cookie, we went the more arduous route of developing our own better, flour rather than simply employing a common, commercial gluten-free flour.*** Most investors wouldn’t be happy with that.

Personally, *I believe that people are ready for higher quality alternatives to commodity, national brands* No matter what you are buying, you deserve the best and in reality we’ve found that the cost differential between quality and commodity is typically less than 15%! In the future we want to challenge the status quo and sell against Famous Amos and Chips Ahoy.

It strikes me daily how fragile life is and how fortunate we’ve been. So… ***before another moment passes I want to thank all you Redditors for supporting us and our unconventional cookie business. Thank you to everyone who believes in what we stand for and especially to those of you who actually search out our cookies and recommend them to friends, a big THANK YOU!***

We’ve learned a lot since our last AMA mostly we learned the process of changing the world, in our case it’s one cookie at a time. 

Thanks to you all, AMA, Bart

P.S. If you guys have the interest, we’ll post some videos of our operation and people.

Edit: So much awesome advice from everyone. 
What I've learned. 

-Deep Freeze. We had Deep Freeze but switched to Clean Slate. Deep Freeze was not playing nice with other programs that we had installed. The head IT dude could explain why this was happening much better then I can. Should we switch back? 

-There are awesome options for handling this. Thank you for the posts and PM's about these. At this point I start to wonder what is the best option, because there are differing points of views offered by many. 

TechSoup, acronis image(wat?), cloning, Couldn't you achieve a similar effect by simply setting up a Scheduled task to robocopy from a restore?(wat??), group policies, whitelist, SteadyState and more. Honestly, how do you pick? What's the best? When I said I'm the Assistant IT person, it means that I help troubleshoot broken printers, why doesn't my USB stick work, or why can't I log in to my email(/frustrated old person shaking a fist at me). The very worst... teaching someone how to use the mouse. Those are the IT problems I deal with. 

I'm a librarian first, but I want to be able to handle situations like this. It's kind of necessary in a small library that I have the skills to do this. I'm also young enough that I WANT to be able to do this. I didn't grow up playing with computers in that way, nor go to school, or have since played with computers to learn how to deal with something like this.  When shit like this comes up, my automatic response is, ""Fuck... now what do I do."" And my mind goes blank. I get so worried about fucking up the machine, that I don't let myself try things.

I'm not going to worry about being cool for redditkin, I know my limits and knowledge base. You guys broke out shit that I've never heard of or understand. And holy shit! Thank you for all the great information! Hopefully between cataloging library materials, I can work on getting better at system admin/troubleshooting stuff. 

How did I handle it today? I unplugged the offending machine from the network, uninstalled steam and TF2, ran malwarebytes, and then I'm leaving it to be ghosted. And with the ghosting, what I did delete, does it even matter? Right? 

""So what's the real lesson here? Don't leave things in the fridge.""

At the beginning of the semester, I told myself ""you know what? I'm gonna get a 4.0"" and I never lost sight of that. It was the first semester I actually set a 4.0 goal.

But then I got sick. They don't really know what happened, and they still don't really know why. Horrible, horrible pain. Debilitating pain. For weeks, I had such terrible abdominal pain that I couldn't move. I missed 3 weeks of classes. My advisors told me to consider taking a leave of absence, so that I could go home and heal. But I'm a stubborn mofo so I refused. I wasn't going to give up. 

I kept in close contact with my professors and TAs, who were all really understanding. I kept up with my work, my studying, even classes whenever I could. Through continuous use of narcotics, through surgery mid-semester, through everything, I refused to give up. And it paid off.

They don't know why I had so much pain, and unfortunately they expect me to have more episodes as life goes on. We'll hopefully figure out how to manage it, but until that time comes I'm going to keep stubbornly holding on to everything and refusing to give up. 

**TL/DR: After debilitating illness, still got a 4.0 and I'm so excited I'm shitting glitter.**

He dated my sister in H.S. and just stuck around after they broke up.  At the funeral, my (biological) brother was introduced as his best friend and my sister as his first love.  He and I weren't quite as close, but both my bro and sis said it was one of the worst days of their life.

He had some problems.  He had a job he hated...he worked long and hard night shifts to make ends meet.  He had a couple of wonderful young children, but had a lot of stress and was battling depression.  On his way home, he lost control of his car and was killed.  Poof.  One of the most genuinely good people every to walk the Earth...gone.

But that's not the point, is it?  We tend to focus on the death, but we don't spend enough time focusing on life while we're living.  My bro and sis, still shell-shocked, called and told me we need to see each other more.  Famous last words, right?  They are in my family.

It took the death of a close friend for my siblings to realize it, but I've known it for years: we're wasting our lives hustling.  I have a wife who I adore and a wonderful family.  I have a number of hobbies.  [But I'm not as happy as I could be because I multitask so much.](http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Midmarket/Brain-Limits-Capacity-for-Multitasking-Report-Finds-467567/)  My job and life has destroyed my brain.  I can't focus or concentrate and when I get home, I have no energy to spend time with my family and I no longer enjoy my hobbies.  We're so concerned with the destination that we fail to appreciate the journey. My *job* saps the energy I need to live my *life*.  That's fucking backwards.  I can't even *read* anymore because my brain is so conditioned to scan that I have to work hard to read for comprehension.

I have a very high-pressure, professional job, but it dawns on me that the happiest people I know are laborers and the most unhappy people are ones with jobs that require them to multitask all day (read: healthcare, management, etc.).  It's only a matter of time before you burn out.


Michaelangelo was asked how he carved a lion sculpture and he said, (and I paraphrase) [""I just carve away anything that doesn't look like a lion and I'm left with a lion.""](http://mymindmagazine.com/?p=1547)  So, Reddit, I'm in the process of changing my life.  I'm about to change job as I have a couple of opportunities that will allow me to do more meaningful work in a way that doesn't crush my soul.  I'm saying no to a lot more family commitments to make room for my wife and kids. I'm taking my life back. 

Like Michaelangelo, my life is a solid block, but I'm determined to carve away until its a masterpiece, because that's what its all about, IMO. When you're 80, how will you look back on the best years of your life and say? Worse, what if youre called home in your prime and never het the chance to live because you've been putting it off? 

Sorry for the mini-manifesto, but I hate how we live in the US. We work so hard to do and have things and in the process we sacrifice everything that matters. 

**tl;dr: Never settle.**

I suffer from depression and anxiety which I would say plays a large part in all this. I have a fairly decent job as a film editor for a videography company, which i enjoy, but its not what I want to be doing for the rest of my life. I am looking into Community College and i am meeting with an advisor at my (former) school tomorrow.
