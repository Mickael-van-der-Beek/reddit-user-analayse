Most importantly...**we need to keep this non-violent.**

They are all lawyers. A cop would not do anything if we ""detained"" them by blocking their way, but no physical contact. 

Surround highway 34 as they would be most likely coming through there, any other roads would be good too if they try to get around. Our intent is to block them from both sides so they can't go anywhere. Ideally, a mile or so away from St. Rose of Lima. 
If you guys get any updates, post them up, and I'll do the same.

The idea is that each top level comment should be a restaurant recommendation in the format:

""Restaurant Name - Town - Cuisine/style - $$* - Brief description or why the poster likes it.""

Up/Down votes will bring the most popular restaurants to the top creating a list of highly recommended places to eat and why. If this goes well we may branch it out into regional threads. Please keep your top level comments limited to one restaurant per comment. Please keep any comments about an already posted restaurant out of the top level and post a reply to the top level and vote accordingly.

I am asking for the mods help to keep the top level comments clean and I thank them for their assistance.

*price is denoted by the standard 1 to 4 dollar sign based on the price of a meal per person as follows:

$ = Cheap, Under $10

$$ = Moderate, $11 - $30

$$$ = Expensive, $31 - $60

$$$$ = Above $61

This is going quite well. I would like to point out that anyone looking to eat in a specific town can just CTRL+F and search for the town name. 

I'm going to see if the mods can add this to the sidebar now.",,False,self,t5_2qji0,1357859718.0,,,True,t3_166zyw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/166zyw/ct_restaurant_recommendation_thread/,

[Proof](http://www.greenwichtime.com/news/article/Democrats-nominate-Dauplaise-for-36th-District-3575271.php)

My opponent voted no (only one of 7) on the bill to legalize gay marriage, voted no on the bill to outlaw the death penalty, and voted no on allowing Sunday liquor sales. Here's his record:

[L. Scott Frantz's Voting Record](http://votesmart.org/candidate/107349/l-scott-frantz)

I am a former NYC School teacher, 10 year veteran of the volunteer fire service, and a current law student. I believe the policies that my opponent has supported with his votes are inappropriate and wrong for Connecticut. I will fight for progressive values, oppose regulation on the internet, push for dollars for education, infrastructure, and fight for my district in a way that treats everyone equally, not just the hyper wealthy.

Connecticut's CEP Grant Program requires 300 individual donations and $15,000 to qualify for a $100,000 grant. I have already started campaigning and have knocked over 1000 doors and made thousands of phone calls.

Even a $5 contribution would be huge help. I know the internet is commited to progressive values. PROVE ME RIGHT!!

I understand the problems recent graduates have, with the increasing costs of education and declining opportunities for jobs - I lived it. There was even a point when I stopped including my UConn education on job applications to avoid being sidelined as overqualified.
This is why my number one priority is to make CT a more hospitable place to do business. The cost of doing business is high, especially for small businesses in my district. When we can lower those costs, small business can grow and expand and CT becomes a more desirable place for bigger business to move or open new branches here. I know too many people who fled Connecticut once they finished school to search for work in other states both because this state doesn't appeal much to young adults and because there isn't a great number of opportunities here. If we can make this state a more attractive place to live, we can keep the talent here, and keep Connecticut thriving! If you have any questions feel free to ask away, but I'll be pretty busy today so I'll get to them all when I can. Thank you so much for reading!

EDIT: Should have mentioned that while I am 23, I'm not inexperienced. I currently serve on a town advisory board, am a member of the Granby Prevention Council (coalition of town leaders, business owners and school officials to prevent substance abuse among Granby's youth) and affiliated with the Lion's club. I do what I can to serve the community that raised me, but know I can be a better advocate for us in Hartord.

He was from Vivint.

I have a pretty good ADT system, but I figured I'd hear the guy out.

My wife and I let him in, and he gave us a sales pitch.

1. Our house was chosen to be a sample house.  This means that installation was free (a supposed ~$1,600 value), but we had to display a sign and be used as a reference.

2. The technology did seem state of the art, and better than our current set-up.

3.  We would have to sign a 60 month contract.  It was $69 a month, including the cell line.  (I inquired about the long term contract, and he was hazy on the cancellation terms).  This was my first red flag.

4.  He could have a technician at our house ASAP.

So at that point, I noticed it was getting dark and I had a lawn to mow.  My wife said she'll continue, because we were interested.  I get about 1/2 my lawn done, and my wife signaled me to come in.  She had signed the contract, but is now getting second thoughts.  

The technician showed up in less than 20 minutes in an old ford Taurus.  No decals, no signs on the vehicle.  Second red flag.

I tell them to wait to do the installation, because we want to do some research.  We cancel the contract.  But apparently they already charged our card $175!

Luckily, my wife was smart enough not to give our checking account number to them, and the charges will be reversed.  A quick Internet search revealed some dubious reviews, and an even quicker call to ADT shed some more light on the story...

Apparently Vivint used to be a contracted company named Apex that ADT used as salesmen/installers.  ADT cancelled the contract due to immoral business practices.  Apex changed their name to Vivint, and has the same owners - but apparently the same practices.

Now, I'm not saying that the salesman and the technician were doing anything illegal.  But I'm telling home-owners in the area to be wary of them.  Every time I tried to delay the process, I was met with excuses and reasons why it had to be installed ASAP.  Frankly, they didn't want us to do research.

We will not be buying Vivint security.  Also, ADT is offering all of the state-of-the art tech for about the same price, and it 's coming from a trusted company.

TL;DR: be careful with Vivint.",,False,self,t5_2qji0,False,,,True,t3_1ewuqh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1ewuqh/vivint_salesperson_came_to_my_house_yesterday/,

I know I am not the only CT resident who feels strongly about the information coming to light concerning the NSA, PRISM, Boundless Informant and the violation of our 4th amendment rights (to name a few salient topics).

Edward Snowden has risked his livelihood, family and life to reveal what he believed was a total dismantling and disregard for the constitutional rights of US citizens. The least we can do to repay his sacrifice is to ensure that it results in actual change.


**Some updates:**

I was thinking of finalizing a few details. Let me know if you all agree.

Location: Hartford CT - No location will be more visible and ripe to show up on the CT state government's radar than the capital itself. That is, if we agree that we need to direct this rally at our stated representatives, as Winoeatsgrapes stated, than I can't of a better location. Specifically I was thinking of Bushnell park due to its proximity to state buildings.

Date - July 4th - Holding the rally in sync with countless cities across America will only serve to strengthen our cause and legitimize our message. Not to mention that the Media will probably have a field day due to the obvious independence connotations.

Time - I'm not yet sure, I believe that it would be most effective to begin as early as possible (within reason). I was thinking sometime around 8:30 AM - 9:00.

As soon as I get some kind of agreement from people I will start working on a special permit application for the city of Hartford.

For awhile it felt like /firstworldproblems, but after a couple nights it turned into one of the most unpleasant experiences I've gone through. I got to see a lot of people at their worst, and some at their best, sadly more were savages than saints.

In front of my house, a possibly live wire had fallen and with their resources stretched thin, left a Subaru with a CL&amp;P worker to guard it for 12 hours during the day, then another worker would take a 12 hour night shift for 2 and a half days. Learned quite a bit from this fellow. I was also able to get some privy information from some city workers, and apparently this state was **STILL** cleaning up from hurricane Irene when the storm hit.

The fact we received several feet of snow across the state combined with all of the leaves still on the trees, created an unfortunate situation that caused trees to buckle under the sudden pressure. The aftermath of this will take several months to completely recover from.

For myself and my fiance, we did not have it as bad as most. We spent the first night with a bottle of vodka and remnant heat before power failure. The second night we tried to find a motel room near the shore which was relatively untouched. We came to find that virtually every room in every hotel/motel was full up through at least Springfield, MA. Not only was everything full, but a lot of places were gouging their rates by several hundred dollars because people will pay to not freeze. We had to return home and endure a below freezing house with mountains of blankets. The next few days were spent driving the state to see what had power. Some malls were open, anywhere and everywhere there was power there were huddled masses surrounding every power socket, charging their laptops, ipods, phones, etc. We managed to find some friends with power and spent days hopping from friend to friend. It was an uncomfortable week, but we endured and thankful it is over.

For those wondering why everyone is to blame, here is what I have learned:

* CL&amp;P laid off half of it's workforce recently, mainly the older and more experienced workers that were unionized. We have a lot less working on this mess than we should have.

* CL&amp;P did not pay everyone from out of state when they came to help with Irene. Some companies sent out only a small fraction of what they sent a few months back because CL&amp;P played the ""oh we didn't pay you? Let us go over our books again"" card.

* CL&amp;P's unofficial strategy was/is to return power back to **commercial** districts first, **then** people's homes. In addition they have been focusing their priorities to percentages, not bulk numbers. They are trying to avoid as much bad PR as they can, so they are trying to bring whatever drops their percentage the fastest.

* Individual cities and negligent home owners are also to blame for the sheer number of trees that fell due to a lack of trimming, and a further lack of enforcement of such ordinances by the cities. The majority of downed lines, at least in my area, were from trees overhanging power lines on private property. My town in particular had actually gone through earlier this year and cut swathes of trees near lines and did a good job of it.

* The work is also slowed due to each town having only 1 master coordinator to direct workers where to go. A lot of folks have generators, and a lot of them are ignorant of how to operate these devices. Whenever a CL&amp;P worker begins to address the next downed line, they must first check with the coordinator to verify that said line is down and safe to work on. Once the ok is given they have to test the line again, because people with generators will sometimes not turn their breakers off, thereby keeping their home connected to the grid and pumping power back out.

* A lot are already aware that some are so uninformed that they were bringing their generators and grills **inside** their homes. Multiple cases of gas poisoning have been reported throughout the state. Governor Dan Malloy was so frustrated with these people being so careless he actually went on the radio and said ""Do **not** bring your gas-powered generators or grills indoors, **you** will die, your **children** will die, and your **neighbor's children** will die.""

* Too many people on the road still do not understand what it means when power is out at an intersection: **IT BECOMES A 4 WAY STOP!!!** A lot of accidents have been occurring statewide due to negligent and careless drivers plowing through these temporary 4 way stops. These have been tying up much needed emergency services all week.

Those are the main issues with why this has been as terrible as it has been. I'm sure I'm forgetting something but I'm just now orienting myself from what a long and crazy week it's been.

One last thing that just personally irks me is the ridiculous army of self-entitled herp derps complaining online about how they were personally affected and demand compensation, complaining about everyone they can name-drop, and doing nothing to help. What people don't realize is that every aspect of this cleanup is handled by a different agency that has to work together very intricately. All power lines are handled by CL&amp;P, all trees are handled by city workers, traffic by local police, etc. If you are or know people who are complaining like imbeciles, please point this out to them.

On a final note before I head out and resume damage control, please enjoy my responses to some of the more stupid complaints I've read so far.

* Your tax dollars have nothing to do with CL&amp;P, they are the ones that are paying for most of this, they want to get this over with asap. The longer they don't give out power, the more they're losing both financially and publicly.

* also you will not be getting a credit on your account from CL&amp;P, it's called NOT PAYING FOR THE ELECTRICITY YOU'RE NOT USING!

* AT&amp;T has nothing to do with this, sorry bub.

* The worst complaints were people bitching that they had power...but no internet. To that I just say fuck you with the sharpest object you can find",,False,self,t5_2qji0,False,,,True,t3_m2if1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/m2if1/i_was_also_a_power_refugee_for_the_last_week_and/,

I'm in my late 50s, but have many friends and family in the state and visit often. When I visit, I often hear people talk about leaving the state. The property taxes, for instance, on my sister's house are $4,600 a year and she can barely afford the bill. It won't be affordable in retirement, and that's the truth of it. It's a simple ranch in Northern Connecticut. I hear my friends complain as well. They think about leaving. Since moving, I've gotten much more familiar with the mid-Atlantic states and how they run themselves. They do some things better than Connecticut. I don't mean to be  negative. There's a lot to like about the state. It is beautiful. But there are bunch of things the state can do to reduce its tax burdens and run more efficiently. Here are my recommendations:   

1. Move to county/regional services. It's an incredible waste of money for towns and cities to pay for their own administrations, finance, information technology, police, fire, etc., for small geographic areas. This duplication contributes to high local property taxes. 

2. The taxing system and economic development effort should be regional. Take New Britain. When the factories closed, it lost its downtown to West Farms Mall. That's a simplification, but there's truth to it. Farmington gets New Britain shoppers and most of the property tax benefit. To compensate for this lack of a regional tax system, the state waste money on economic development projects in the urban areas that actually end up accomplishing little. Hartford has been an economic development sinkhole since Constitution Plaza.  

3. Get rid of property taxes on cars. It's absolutely the most horrible tax. 

4. Adopt a homestead tax provision. If you live in your home, DC reduces your assessed value by $38,000. It's a significant savings. The trade off may be higher income and sales taxes.  

5. Adopt alternative means of transportation. Connecticut's bus system is a total joke. Many communities lack sidewalks, and forget about bike lanes. The state is overly car dependent, and that makes it very expensive.

Gaming/LAN party, ""bad"" movie night, beer tasting (that usually just ends up as a drunkfest), etc.

I know it's going to take a bit of effort and work to coordinate anything, but since it's CT we're at an advantage where most of us can get together within an hour's time.

I moved back in with my parents/roommates so sadly I wouldn't be able to host anything at my roommate's house (unless we call it a early night around 1am or so), and most of my friends here are either parents now, have moved out of state, or want to go out to and get wasted.

Looks like the winning dates were Friday 2/15 and Thursday 2/21, but to be honest, the special on Fridays sucks (it's just that prime rib is available), plus I don't know if people voted certain days to correspond with their bar choice (like if Fridays work best for someone but Corleones, the bar they voted for, have cool specials Thursdays so they only voted Thursday... stuff like that.)

Since prime rib doesn't sound cheap, I'm thinking Thursday, but tbh, I work, and Saturday (2/16), Monday (2/18), Tuesday (2/19) and Saturday (2/23) all got 7 votes, so we'll just go with whatever you guys think in the comments and I'll post that as a definite time and place.

I'll try to keep the list updated, so people don't need to read through the comments for everything, but I can't promise speed on this.

If you're looking for a specific activity, remember that Ctrl+F is your friend!    
    
    

**Fairfield County**    

* Waveny Park: New Canaan. Great place for picnics, frisbee, baseball, running, soccer, lacrosse. Nice paved walk-ways for cycling, rollerblading, dog-walking, walking, hiking trails. It's very peaceful and safe and beautiful! This place is great for groups of people [It's a public park, so there's no parking fee]
* Cranbury Park: Norwalk. Hiking, playground, the monkey tree.
* Huntington State Park: Redding. Mountain biking and hiking.
* Mianus River Park: Stamford. Walking, Dog-Friendly, trail running, mountain biking.    
    
**Hartford County**    

* Crescent Lake
* Ragged Mountain: Berlin (West Lane entrance) has wonderful trails for hiking/biking.    
* Talcott Mountain, Heublein Tower trail    
* Farmington River Trail: Collinsville.
    
    
**Litchfield County**    

* Bear Mountain/Lion's Head (Appalachian Trail): Salisbury
* Haystack Mountain: Norfolk    
* Dennis Hill State Park, Norfolk: Great views(Formally epic views, but they ripped out the widows walk) and good short hikes
* Pagnut State Forrest, Torrington(Burr Pond and surrounding area) - Really good hiking and fairly well maintained
* Mohawk State Park, Goshen: Hiking. Lots of hiking. And bugs. But the hiking is worth it.
* Harwinton Conservation Area: A few loops of varying difficulty, culminating in around a 3 mile hike or so at it's longest. Very dog friendly.
* Mt Tom State Park, Litchfield: excellent hiking, decent swimming, and really good views from the top of the surrounding area. The tower(Like Haystack in Norfolk)hasn't been open for awhile, but frankly, never stopped me.
* Peoples/American State Forrests: New Hartford/Barkhamsted: moderate hiking, and excellent fishing on the farmington river. Honestly, this is just a nice area. You can just park on the side of the road somewhere and go for a walk and enjoy Barkhamsted/Riverton/New Hartford.
* Colebrook River Lake area: Big resivoir/state land area off Rt8 on the CT/MA boarder. Fishing, boating, hiking, pretty much all of it. And just an interesting place to go when you realize there's a whole town at the bottom.  
* Kent Falls State Park    
* White Memorial
* Rand's View: Falls Village

**Middlesex County**    

* Chatfield Hollow State Park    
* Devil's Hopyard    
    
**New Haven County**    

* Sleeping Giant: Hamden. Great all-purpose park with easy trails and picnic locations    
* Lighthouse Point Park, great view of the New Haven skyline with a century-old carousel you can ride on for like fifty cents or something. [Like most beaches, the parking is very pricey, but you can park on any side street off of Lighthouse Road as your drive in and walk five minutes into the park.]    
* Chaffinch Island State Park (Guilford). A quiet little shoreline park, with access to walk out onto the rocks at the water's edge, and plenty of grassy area for picnics and reading.    
    
**New London County**    

* Salmon River State Forest. Visit the cool wooden bridge.    
    
    
**Tolland County**    

* [Nipmunk Trail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nipmuck_Trail)

On this particular evening, they are holding a battle of the bands and the winner of the contest is going to get a spot to play at the Mayhem Fest when it comes to Hartford in August.  (We're probably going to be the LEAST metal band playing that evening.  I didn't really care that we weren't playing to our ""demographic"", I just want a chance to play a huge festival!)  The catch is that the  evening's winner is determined by the number of people who come for each individual band and I know it's a bit shameless to go and ask for this kind of support on Reddit, but I know that if there is any group of people that could give us the support we need, it's my fellow Redditers.  

Here is the link to our website:
[The Autumn's Official Band Page](http://www.intheautumn.com)

Even if you don't end up going to the show, download our music!  It's all there on our webpage and **THE MUSIC IS FREE!!!!!**

Here is the link for the Facebook event we made for the show.  
[The Autumn - Battle for Mayhem Fest](http://www.facebook.com/events/119359394870767/) 

You'll see in the description how you can get discount tickets.  **These are crucial** if you do go, as this is what determines the head count for each band playing that night.

I don't know about you, but I think it would be nice to spend a night making new friends and diggin' on some local music.

See you this weekend at the meetup!!!

I left my number with the lifeguards at the beach, but I know nobody will ever find it and if they do, I'm sure they will keep it.

I sent this to him at: https://forms.house.gov/larson/contact_new.html

Your cosponsorship of SOPA is damning enough to warrant your removal from office.

You must not have read the bill because it's the equivalent of someone storing something illegal in a bank box and the government being then able to shut down the entire bank and all its branches as a response. To show just how ridiculous this bill is, here's a whitehouse.gov petition that includes a copyrighted image. If SOPA passed, the whitehouse.gov domain would have to be taken offline.

This would kill the free flow of ideas and liberty that is what makes the internet one of the most important developments in human history. I have already taken the step of moving my domain names from GoDaddy who supports SOPA. Business is flowing out of the US every day due to this bill. Just google ""godaddy losing customers"" to see the tens of thousands per day that are leaving in response.

I would like a formal response to why you are a cosponsor and for your removal of cosponsorship and rejection of SOPA.

Thank you

That said, I'd like to do what I can to help parents to talk to their children about what happened.

* Turn off the news. The constant coverage isn't going to do your kids any good- the negativity will only make things worse.

* If your children have seen the news, or if they're somewhat older, you may want to watch the news with them and talk about what happened. Try to focus on anything positive.

* Make them feel safe- reassure them that whatever happened is over, and that they'll be safe.

* Maintain perspective. Help your child to understand that this doesn't happen very often- in spite of the constant news reporting of the event which may give your child the opposite impression.

I've got a collection of about 75 games in their original packaging with all original manuals, etc, ranging from recent to not so recent. I'm selling the entire pile for $150, enough for two all weekend passes to CT-Con at the door and a bit of spending cash. :)

The newest game is Far Cry 3 to give you an idea of what's in the pile. I also have lots of AAA titles from the past few years in there. With an average price of $2 per game, you can't go wrong. With time and patience you could make money on this deal by selling on CL/Amazon/Ebay/whatever.

Our finances took a hit this summer when my dog unexpectedly needed surgery (and a few redditors helped us boost her fundraiser which paid for about a third of it!!!), so that's why I'm trying this crash-course sale to raise funds for the convention.

Some highlights from the collection:


* Far Cry 3
* Bioshock 2
* Dead Island
* Gears of War 1, 2, &amp; 3
* Ghostbusters
* The Orange Box
* Dishonored
* Deus Ex: Human Revolution
* Halo 3
* Halo ODST
* LA Noire
* Sleeping Dogs
* Mass Effect 2 &amp; 3 (1 is on the hard drive so can't include it, sorry)
* Borderlands 1
* Battlefield 3
* Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3
* Call of Duty Black Ops 2
* BulletStorm

But I'm interested in what folks do here?

Here's how I've been passing the time:

- walking/jogging the ~mile loop at Cove Island Park in Stamford, CT
- hanging out at various bars in downtown Stamford (but avoiding Alive@5)
- finish the night off at Bull's Head Diner in Stamford, although I think they've changed their name
- Stand in line on Summer Street for DQ, totally worth the wait
- Do brunch while sitting at the side windows at Chocopologie in Norwalk, and watch as they make various pastries and tasty treats
- Oyster Festival in South Norwalk (just for a day, never two)
- Take sailing classes at Calf Pasture Beach in Norwalk
- Eat along the water at Sunset Grille in Calf Pasture Beach
- Stew Leonard's. Need I say more?
- Randomly decide I need more stuff from Bed, Bath, and Beyond on the Westport-Norwalk border.
- Driving down Boxwood Road in Norwalk between Thanksgiving and Christmas, to see the guy who decks out his entire house (and next door land) in Christmas decorations
- Drive down Old Huckleberry Lane in Wilton, and take in the sight of the South Norwalk reservoir.
- People-watching at the Starbucks in New Canaan (across from the train station)
- Breakfast or late night breakfast at Orem's Diner.
- Driving up the Merritt (at least past Hamden), and picking a random diner to eat at.

I've had some success in the past and there will be at least 2 of you fellow Redditors there. My thought was either Cask Republic or Firehouse in New Haven but am definitely open to suggests or other locales if everyone isn't 21. 

Let me know what you guys think.

Edit: 

Great, sounds like we'll have a good turnout. Cask seems to be the preference so I think we'll meet there. We can always pick Firehouse next time. My original thought was 8 PM but it seems there's interest in earlier and getting dinner too. I don't mind hanging out later if people want to do both. So let's say this:

**6 PM for dinner and 8 PM if you just want drinks.** **Saturday**

If you guys can give me a heads up as to which you'll show up to that would be great. I can PM you my number once you're confirmed to help coordinate meeting. I'll try to message everyone too in-case people don't check back.

Edit 2: I'll be sending out my number to you guys shortly. If you haven't noted whether or not your getting dinner, let me know so we can get the correct size table. Also, I'll be wearing a bright red shirt to make me easy to find.

Edit 3: I think I've gotten all you. I did from my inbox sorry if I missed you, just let me know. we've got 6 for dinner so far.

Also, I don't have a working printer if someone wants to print out a Snoo to put at the table.

No arguing with them, no BS. Just a fact that for every member of their church that shows up in our state, GLAAD will be getting ten bucks. So I am trying to get others on board. I am trying to get others to pledge any amount to donate to a LGBT friendly organization for each member of the church that shows up in CT. Bluffs are also accepted :) The most important part is that the WBC sees that if they show up, they are working against themselves. Tweet them, call them, email them your pledge. I want them to realize that the most beneficial thing they can do is to stay home. These people feed off controversy and that is why I spelled it out rather simply for them. Them showing up = money into GLAAD's pocket. The most important part is to tell them directly. If their twitter accounts are flooded with this then they might get the point.

So I recently noticed this twitter account due to it getting retweets from people I follow. It claims to be owned by a parent of a victim of the Newtown shootings, with a son called Ryan. But checking the victim lists (http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/dec/15/newtown-shooting-victims-full-list) there isn't actually a victim called Ryan.
Once I realised this, it became clear that this person is taking advantage of the tragedy and of people's guilt with phrases like 'ignore if you don't care' on it's pictures in order to get retweets, and I think something should be done about it. 

It violates twitter's 'Impersonation' policy (https://support.twitter.com/groups/33-report-abuse-or-policy-violations/topics/148-policy-information/articles/18366-impersonation-policy), and so I think we would be doing a good deed if we got the account removed.

I'm a smart guy, a pilot, 2nd lieutenant in the CT Civil Air Patrol, and have years of experience making television commercials for people all over the country. I'm also a martial arts and self defense expert. 

I'm also strong- 6'4"" 250, I am very healthy, and could probably lift 100 pounds over my head all day long without really being bothered by it. I'm willing to do any job that's out there, whether it's sitting at a desk all day, or working my tail off on the side of the highway. 

I know that people hiring aren't interested in desperate people looking for jobs, but I have tried almost everything except honesty during my job search, and now I just need to get busy. I don't care. 

I have a clean driving record and NO criminal history. I'm a good person, fun to be around, and a reliable human being you can count on to do whatever you need. Thanks for your time. Please PM me if you would be interested in hiring me!

Rhode Island is okay too. 


* **EDIT: I figure I should post what I'm good at/know how to do.**

* I am totally fluent in Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, MAC and PC. I know how to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. Here is a link to my work on Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/user6273524/videos

* I am familiar with basic IT roles- networking, probably on an entry level basis.

* I am a good graphic designer, although I don't have too much to show in regards to a portfolio. I've been designing websites since the dawn of the internet, back in 1995. While I'm not a ""web designer"" per se, I can manage and do upkeep on websites. I'm very knowledgable in online marketing (PPC, and SEO). I can show some recent examples of all of these things. 

* I have lots of experience as a copywriter, writing tv commercials and web content. 

* I'm a pilot, so am comfortable around heavy machinery and high pressure situations with very expensive utilities.

* I have a general knowledge of carpentry, demolition, electrical, and painting skill sets. I'm very, very handy and can build/repair almost anything easily. 

* I'm a fast learner! I can learn anything in under 30 minutes. I've done so many things in my life, from being a bartender back in college, to directing national tv commercials with celebrity stars, to landing behind a 737 in a 1500 pound cessna with a 200 foot ceiling at an international airport, to framing houses with hammers and nails, that I don't need much hand holding. My current situation is a product of this recession, and I'm no longer going to be bummed about it. I'm going to accept it head on from here on out and hope that someone can find the kindness to give me a chance.

I'm late 20's, married with 3 dogs, live on the shoreline, have 2 car payments, and lots of student loan debt. **I'm not going to give up.**

I was wondering if there were any abandoned places to explore around Connecticut.  I like to read up on the history of long forgotten places and then visit to take pictures.  I've been to the Sunrise Resort (people actually walk their dogs there all the time which is crazy) and the insane asylum in Belchertown, MA.  I got some pretty good pictures too. I hear there might be something in Storrs, CT?  

I wouldn't mind if the place is all locked up and I can take pictures from the perimeter of the grounds, I just like looking at new places if anyone knows of any around CT.

On a different note, I would say I could also use an exploring buddy, but I'm pretty sure ""hey, you don't know me, but let's meet up and explore an abandoned place way out in the middle of nowhere"" is like a 10 on the creepy scale.  (However, I'll let the offer still stand.)

Anyhoobles, I'd be quite grateful if anyone had any suggestions. :)

~lehmongeloh

**Edit:** Thanks a bunch for the super fast suggestions *and* exploring buddy offers.  That's way cool.  I'll try to plan some stuff out, but if not well at least there are other people on this thread who you know are down to do some exploring. :)  

Also since some people have PM'd me [here's](http://imgur.com/a/pbJyM#0) the photos from Belchertown, MA I took and [here's](http://imgur.com/a/oE9eO) the pictures I took from Sunrise Resort and now [here's](http://imgur.com/a/nNeIZ) the photos from the Seaside Sanatorium.  I'm not a photographer so they aren't very good, but you get the idea of what it looks like.  Hope that helps for people who wanted to explore the area.

She is not eligible for unemployment because she wasn't drawing a paycheck from the shop.  We live in the greater Waterbury area, and if the travel is not too much, I know she would drive it.

Every Wednesday in July, the Bethel High School track team hosts races for kids, starting at 6PM.


Children of all ages and from any town can participate in 50m, 100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, and mile heats.  Adults can run the mile too!  Ribbons with times are awarded to every finisher, so kids can keep track of their improvement throughout the series.  Each runner also gets a popsicle!


After the races, kids get the chance to learn a field event - a different one every week, from discus to high jump.


The point of these races is to keep kids active, get them interested in track &amp; field, and have fun!  This has been going on every summer for the past several years, and we have a great community that's involved.


There's a weekly $2 participation fee for each runner.  Registration starts at 5:30PM, at the white tent on the Bethel High School track.  The series runs July 3rd, 10th, 17th, 24th, and 31st.

Due to the economy and fewer listeners staying with a “niche format” according to our owner, he decided to widen the station’s appeal by including bands we haven’t played for the 14 years he let us do what we wanted.

1354563110.0,20,self.Connecticut,147r7n,I want to file a complaint about the Connecticut Post. Any one know who to complain to? Story in text box.,dontbthatguy,23,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/147r7n/i_want_to_file_a_complaint_about_the_connecticut/,"So last year my girlfriend signed me up for a 3 week trial of the CT Post paying 15 bucks on the spot. I said awesome but, hey, I have the internet and really don't need the paper. So we canceled it shortly after.

Fast forward to October, I get a letter from the Simons Agency Inc. [This](http://i.imgur.com/EWj5I.jpg?4) is the letter I received. I blocked my info and the employee and employee ID's of who I spoke with throughout the two month ordeal. 

My first complaint is that I was referred to a collection agency threatening to report me to the credit bureau without first sending me any notice what so ever. 

Second is that I spoke with 6 people over 5 phone calls spanning 2 months without the problem being solved. All customer service employees were helpful and kind (except for one) but the process it self is flawed and despite talking to them today saying I have a zero balance, the problem still isn't over because the collection agency has not heard from the CT post yet.

The first 2 times I called I was told the problem was taken care of. I requested an email confirming that, but never received it which prompted me to call back.

The 3rd time I called I spoke with someone telling me there is nothing she could do and I had to wait for employee X to call me. Employee X never called me, so I called again the next day. I was told again to wait for employee X. I asked to speak with employee X directly and was told that isn't possible. I asked for employee X's number but they did not to give it to me. After waiting till today I called back. 

Today I was told today that as of 11/10 my balance was $0.00 So apparently some one took care of it but never told me. 

So I called the credit agency. According to them I still have a balance. I was told to email them explaining what had happened (I sent them what I have said before but with every employee's name and ID numbers.)

Now I am waiting to hear from the credit agency wether or not they can zero my balance based on the email I sent them, or if I have to call the Post again and have them contact the credit agency. 

What angers me is we aren't dealing with an erroneous bill or a past due notice. This went to credit agency threatening my credit history. Yes I know it would take a lot for any of this to get reported to the credit bureau, but that isn't the point. I was respectful on every occasion and could not get a single person to even e-mail me back.

I've been interested in meeting people from reddit because I'm constantly amused and amazed by people on here. Since I went back to school I pretty much dropped 50 percent of my friend base mostly due to the fact that I had no more time to be in my 20s and pretend I was still a teenager. The friends that I have left are insightful and smart.
So, to satisfy my curiosity and to just meet new people, lets do a meetup. I would prefer the new haven area but I'm no stranger to travel and would go to any major spot except the quiet corner. Suggestions?
The time I'm shooting for is Sunday evening.

Edit: we are meeting at The Outer Space in Hamden. Its in the same plaza as
The Space music club

Edit: 7pm Sunday

Edit: anyone want to contact me directly, you can pm me, I'll friend you on facebook and we can chat via that. I'm going to ttalk to the user that suggested the outer space and see if we can reserve a table or two

Edit: I will print out the reddit alien mascot and tape it to the side of the table

Edit: there is a door cover of five dollars that goes to the band (we will be sitting outside though). The owner said that the reddit meetup doesn't have to pay so he wants a headcount.

“Rough Around the Edges” III

An Exhibition of new and emerging artists

WINDSOR, CT — Passion is the theme of this year’s artistic extravaganza, “Rough Around the Edges.” This vibrantly colorful and eclectic event brings together some of the most talented and prolific native Connecticut artists, along with invited guest artists from both coasts.  The annual Rough Around The Edges show, this year at Windsor Art Center,  has appeared and been acclaimed as one of the Hartford Courant's top picks in 2011. Narrative paintings, figurative drawings and prints, abstract and moody works in addition to some thought-provoking and fun sculptures, photography, short art films, an installation and more combine to make this event yet another potential sell out and well-attended opening. The opening reception features a filled evening of live music both indoors and outdoors, including folk, instrumental world fusion, and psychedelic dream-rock featuring John Parson, Heirlooms and String Theorie adding to the unique flavor of the show. Keep an eye out for the opening night ever-popular Lucky Taco Truck bringing Tex-Mex pork carnitas tacos, beef picadillo tacos, portabella fajitas and tasty burritos to the Windsor Art Center!

Those that appreciate art, self-expression and the creative process will not want to miss this exciting, albeit rough around the edges creative project. Find out what passion looks like this summer. So get off your computer, get out of the house and join some of your fellow humans and explore the essence of humanity, anti-apathy and sincerity.

What's more, after the meetup, there are a number of things for both the &lt;21 and &gt;21 crowd afterwards. The question that remains is, what is best for you?

From the ct.gov website:
&gt;Through the program, called SelectCT ID, people verifying will get a gold star on the license or ID card. Those declining will have one stamped ""Not for Federal Identification.""  The difference could be extra screening under a proposed federal program slated to go into effect in 2017 for airports and federal buildings and also use for possible commercial transactions. The program stems from national security measures and federal identification standards resulting from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S.

After being seated and ordering drinks, the waitress came back and carded everyone once more.

1355973979.0,16,self.Connecticut,155bo3,I went to Sandy Hook and Woodbury today to see what I could see. This is my recollection. (100% non-political),soral,30,14,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/155bo3/i_went_to_sandy_hook_and_woodbury_today_to_see/,"I figured I'd share with as many people as I could my experiences of the day.
I consider most of you people to be decent humans, so here it goes.......

I decided around noon that I would go to Woodbury with a teacher friend of mine who had the day off, and had heard that the Westboro Baptist Church would be protesting the funeral. I thought to myself, this is just the worst of the worst and I want to do something if I can, plus, it's only the town over... But most of all, I hadn't been over to that area since the mass murder, and I wanted to pay respects and reflect on the whole thing.

I never even met up with my friend because she actually knew the Principal and people who taught there, so she planned on going just before, and attending the funeral. I decided to pretty much go right away. I ran home, dropped the dog off, grabbed the good video camera, and hit the road.
(I should have brought the dog, as there was a nice grassy area where people had dogs...... dogs always cheer people up)

I decided I had 2 places to go from what I read
~Woodbury for the funeral, where the WBC was said to be going
~Newtown HS, which was suppose to be either a gathering/rallying point, or at least have some nice displays or something. 

When I got to Woodbury, there was probably 500-1000 people (plus a constant stream of large groups walking up all the time) just standing outside along the road and in a nice quiet park across the street from the funeral site. 
This group of people included all walks of life; cops, military, teachers, parents, grandparents, motorcycle clubs, construction workers, fancy suits, college kids, a few OWS people, and everyone in between, all there with two clear purposes.

#1. To remember, pray, and pay tribute to the dead.
#2. Protect, anti-protest, and make sure that if Westboro Baptist Church showed up, it would be a large error on the part of the WBC.

This is the only decent picture I took, and it doesn't do justice to the size of the crowd
http://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-glyiKCMAAkhYv.jpg

I left there after about 30 minutes, and then drove to the High School which took forever with the traffic. I arrived, and it was pretty much empty. There was nice display of flowers, candles, signs, etc in front of the High School's sign, but that was pretty much it, which was rather disappointing and unexpected. Some of it had been blown over from the wind, so I did what I could to put the displays as visible as possible. Then I got in the car intending on heading home.

I decided to drive through Sandy Hook instead of taking the highway on the way home.... I am so glad and heartbroken that I did. 

I arrived in the tiny downtown area of Sandy Hook with my mouth hanging open. I found a spot on the side of the road, parked, and stayed there for a very long time.
What I saw was just completely heartbreaking and the saddest thing I have ever seen. It was also a great display of what humanity can be all about.
Prayers, flowers, signs, displays of all sizes, flags, and a million other things covering nearly every square inch of the entire little downtown area. 
Strangers were hugging and crying on each other, anyone with a uniform was thanked, there was only sorrow...... and love..... and nothing else.

It was too emotional to even explain properly. I felt worse than when I visited Ground Zero (when it was still Ground Zero), and 9/11 changed my outlook on life.... this was worse.

*However.........*
I did videotape all of this, including the things that made me cry while at Sandy Hook. I haven't done anything with the video yet, but I will get it online sooner than later to share with everyone.

It was a rough afternoon, **and I was just an observer**. I can't even fathom what these families, kids, and the teachers and their families are going through.... 

Then as I was leaving, I saw something that just made me cry with awe and joy and most of all, hope.
*
I had my video camera out, and was filming a Newtown Elementary School Bus driving up to the highly decorated memorial street corner I was standing at.
I recorded the bus approach, and then in each window, kids with huge smiles, giggling and laughing and waving at my video camera as they drove by.*

 
As a wise master once said, ""Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.""

/I did take video of the entire day, and will post once I get the emotions to watch it again and do some editing and such

The abandoned highway (it's basically as epic as it sounds), is an abandoned stretch of Route 9, including the massive stack interchange you drive under on 84 through Farmington. The entire stack isn't abandoned though, a couple of the interchanges still carry traffic. There's some really cool graffiti up there definitely worth checking out. Anyway, you get there by driving down Tunxis Road in West Hartford/Farmington until you find this massive monastery on the south side of the road. Drive all the way to the end of the parking lot and park. Walk around the stations of the cross in a counter-clockwise manner, and right after the sixth station (may be fifth, I can't remember) is a path leading into the woods. Take it, and then you'll have to climb over this massive log, and then you're on the highway. It's a pretty well kept secret too. Just be careful it's not unheard of for police to be there (been there over 10 times and never seen po myself). I'll upload some pictures in the comments, if there's any interest.

He let me scoop him up, get him all cleaned up, and he is happily napping now. Thank you to everyone who had advice and offers to help!*** 

Quick version of the backstory: There's an incredibly sweet boy kitty in my neighborhood who is very obviously non-feral. He was either abandoned or otherwise lost. We have been feeding him for a few weeks, and have decided we want to take him to get an exam, fixed if necessary, all his shots, flea/tick/mite/worm treatments and bring him into our home.

I have an appointment with the T.E.A.M. mobile alteration/vaccination unit on Monday so that all of these services can be rendered. Now I just need to get a hold of the guy by then! But so far, I haven't seen him over the last few days since we made the decision - I've just seen his food going down. Which I suppose could be any little animal that stops by but I'm hoping it's him.

I'm looking for a hav-a-hart or similar humane trap that I can set up starting tomorrow with food bait and water, in the shade and covered as recommended, and only while I am home and can check it at very regular intervals. I know the heat is terrible out there, and I would not be leaving it unattended for long periods of time. He comes around at night mostly to nosh on the food we leave out for him, and I think he'd be okay in there for a couple hours at night but again, I will have my alarm set to check at regular intervals.

My plan is to get him inside for a bath and de-flea situation. He would not be ""stored"" in the trap until Monday, it's just to get a hold of him so I can bring him inside. He also needs to go without food for 24 hours before surgery, so if I could get this trap set up tomorrow and cross my fingers we get him and not a raccoon by Sunday morning, that would be great.

If anyone has one of these, or knows where I can borrow one, or even rent one if it's necessary - especially in the Central CT area, I'd appreciate the information!

WTF do I do since I've got no proof of purchase and how can they require proof of purchase if there was no requirement prior?

Is there a park, point, restaurant, building, store, house, street, someplace that you would like to see? Maybe in a certain style like tilt-shift, panoramic, long exposure, black and white, etc? Even what time of day that you would like best. Let me know and I'll go and shoot as many as I can, the best I can.

I want to know how you all feel about Facebook events being made for any submission to /r/connecticut that specifies date and time.

Even if you are a [Mr_Snarky_](http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/u1uzp/for_anyone_still_interested_in_a_beer_or_two/c4rsk0g) type, I figure a working calendar with date, time and location might actually increase the odds that the kindred can coalesce.

tl;dr Would CT Redditors approve of meetups, events, happy-hours (anything with date and time mentioned in submissions) being made into a Facebook event? Or will event notifications suck? Maybe mods can implement a calendar in the sidebar so RSVP's can be anonymous vs linked to facebook accounts.

*if mostly positive I will just start creating facebook events and hope others will too.

Put simply, I intend to hire a car, and drive around. I'm planning on sticking to the New England area, partly because it'd take so long to drive elsewhere, but mainly because it seems so damn nice! I'm not bothered about visiting cities, I can do them as separate trips. On this trip I want to see the America that exists outside the cities.

So what I'm wanting to know is, are there any nice places I should go, things to see etc? I realise most people here will just comment about things in CT, but that's cool.

A couple of things I have planned already are going to a baseball game at Fenway Park, going to see a NASCAR race (there's one scheduled for end of Sept in Loudon, which is handy!), and going up the cog-railway on Mt Washington.

I'd also really like to see the famous New England fall foliage. I think late Sept is probably just late enough to see it, but would appreciate local knowledge on this and everything else.

I might go a bit out of New England and head down to Gettysburg, or even across to Niagra Falls, although those would involve significant drives, so they may not happen.

Anyway, any advice you can give, or help with places to go, would be much appreciated! :)",,False,self,t5_2qji0,False,,,True,t3_meq19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/meq19/going_on_holiday_to_new_england_next_year_can_you/,

Some questions &amp; advice needed.",supersecretness,20,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Connecticut/comments/1j5cm4/ct_native_now_living_in_houston_looking_to_move/,"Hi all. So I grew up in the Southeastern Connecticut area (Groton/New London) for most of my life. After graduating college, I moved down to Houston with my wife (also from CT) to work for Hewlett-Packard. Our life in Houston is great (low cost of living, awesome house, lots of entertainment, job is great), but there's part of me that misses home. Our daughter was born last week, and raising her away from both sets of grandparents, and the majority of our family, is less than ideal.

Houston is a great city, and if it weren't for family in CT, we would stay here. However, family is family, and it's important to us that we raise our children around our family. CT is beautiful, and I miss the snow, mountains, and seasons. Anyhow, this brings up sort of a predicament, and some concerns I have:

* Job Market - The technology job market in Houston is strong, while Connecticut seems to be lacking. While I may be able to transition to a work from home type position here at HP, it's not a definite. Can anyone provide some insight into tech companies or places to look in the Southeastern Connecticut area? The only things that come to mind are the casinos, and General Dynamics. I'd be open to commuting to Hartford, or the surrounding area, if I could find a good fit somewhere (my background is in server design, systems/test engineering &amp; project management).

* Building a Home - I realize there are a lot of variables here, but, this is something that I've never done, nor ever thought about. I'd assume this is a long, drawn out process. Does anyone have any reliable, reasonable contacts for a home builder in the area? I would imagine our beautiful, 2400 sqft home here in Houston would likely cost us double in CT (139k in New England won't get us much on a 3-4 bedroom, new construction home).

* Cost of Living - We all know CT is towards the top of the list in ""Most Expensive Places To Live,"" and while it's been 10 years since I've technically lived in CT, I know how pricey it can be. Have things been getting worse? Housing prices going up? Gas prices? Any insight here would help.

* Schools - Nothing can be worse than Houston schools, plain and simple. While I know New England as a whole tends to rank quite highly, I'm not sure where CT stands today. With a newborn here, and school just a few years away, this is something I'm going to have to start to care about. Any thoughts?

I know this isn't a whole lot of detail, and I may be rambling here, but I'd really appreciate some advice from some current residents. Ultimately, it's a decision that we'll have to make on our own, but whatever advice, tips, or suggestions you guys can provide, would really help.

He was totally gungho about moving in and so I stopped looking for other potential roommates.  We went over our expenses, figured everything out and determined that it was more than feasible for us to afford the house I currently live in.  My current roommates are moving out next Wednesday and I have enough money to cover a whole month's rent on my own but I need to find someone fast because it is not something I can sustain.  

I live in Monroe, right on Rt. 25.  It's easy enough to get anywhere as it's a main road, but far enough so that we get our privacy as well.  I really don't want to lose my house as it is really the best place for me to work on my music and commute to my day job.  A super nice, quiet neighborhood...you never have to worry about crime in this area.

We'd split the rent and bills down the middle.  Altogether, it would cost you $650 a month.

If anyone can seriously inquire about taking room, I'd be most appreciative.  I'm available if you want to check it out any day after 5 PM.

Also, the salary is 47k (before taxes), and I've seen that this is one of the most expensive places in the whole country to live.   Is decent housing available or would I be in someone's basement eating ramen noodles?  I've seen one bedrooms around 1k/month, but does anyone know of a better deal?
