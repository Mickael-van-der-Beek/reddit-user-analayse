After a walk in the park with the Gargoyles you tested me with Capra but I prevailed. In the depths you tested my nerve with the butchers and the darkness but I prevailed. Gaping Dragon proved to be more bark than bite. 

In the fabled Blighttown I moved slowly but surely, only succumbing once to toxin, the poison lakes claimed me on my first attempt but then I found your bonfire. I pillaged your stores – weapons, armor, even a Firekeeper soul – it was all mine.  Queelag pushed me to my limits, I tried several approaches, two rounds of Gold Pine Resin and still I could not kill her. Running low on purple moss I felt the pressure, I needed a new tactic, I would show no fear, I would stay close to the beast and wait for my openings, making sure to block her fireball attack – I had cracked it, triumph was mine!   

With renewed vigor I approached Sen's Fortress, the Man Serpents packed more punch than I was used to but I pressed. Traps and paths proved treacherous but I tried, and died, and tried again.  The exterior of Sen's was a cakewalk, Baldur knights, Ricard, and giants slain with ease. In the distance I spied a towering Iron Golem beyond the fog wall and for a moment I hesitated, I had only 2 Estus flasks remaining but with hubris I pressed on. With the golem standing before me I rushed ahead, swinging hard at his legs until he became stunned. I swung and slashed, my halberd shredding him as he fell back, I did not let up until the giant was slain. 

With the giant destroyed I approached the white light, Dark Souls was ready with it's next challenge – Anor Londo. Unlike before I was not scared of this new challenge, I had been tested and pushed but I pushed back, I knew Anor Londo would challenge me but I *knew* I would prevail. 

Quickly I returned to the Undead Parish to visit with Andre, I reinforced my trusty halberd from +7 to +10 and that's when Dark Souls fought back. I left the room for 5 minutes only to return to a black screen on my television set. I glanced down at my Playstation and saw something I had never seen, a flashing red light. I searched Google for this condition, the YLOD it's called, and it meant my Playstation had gone hollow. 

Just when I was feeling confident that I was the Chosen Undead Dark Souls reminded why it's *Dark Souls*, and then I could hear it laughing at me ""Keh heh heh heh…"".

tl;dr Dark Souls couldn't kill me so it killed my PS3.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,False,,10,True,t3_1cv6su,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1cv6su/dark_souls_has_beaten_me/,

We all love Dark Soul's addictive gameplay, the cool bosses and the unforgiving mechanics. But there is something more that keeps us coming back, and has spawned countless discussions on lore: The atmosphere, as in design of the world, backstory, behaviour of NPCs etc. To me, at least, DS seemed like one of these waking dreams (where you're *almost* awake and only realise you are sleeping because things are subtly, but definitely, off). Some examples of what I mean:  
  
1. Every NPC behaves as if he has some form of mental damage. ""Kekeke"", ""I am simply crestfallen"", ""if only I could be so grossly incandescent!"", ""and so the lass weeps in solitude..."". NO-ONE speaks like this. If you combine that with the fake-old English, you pretty much have psycho horror dialogue (think ""Jacob's ladder"" or similar).  
2. Lordran (and Londo) consist mainly of battlements and spires. Look around at Firelink Shrine. You will see circle-segment battlements stretch out half to the horizon. IN FRONT of the Undead Parish walls. Which are IN FRONT of the Anor Londo walls. Defending against what or whom? Where are the markets? Where are the ""normal"" houses (except for like ONE place in Undead Burgh)? Before the Undead Curse, did Anor Londo lose like 100 citizens each day to treacherous (and pointless) walkways? There is no rhyme or reason to ANY of the architecture, except that (again dreamlike) it evokes middle-aged themes without ACTUALLY resembling it. It's like somebody turned a castle alive, and told it to mutate.  
3. There is no redemption in the story. No-one is ""good"", or actually ""evil"" for that matter. Yes, you could ARGUE that invaders are evil, but are they really? After all, they obey a God/ primordial serpent (Nito/ Kaathe) just as the Sunbros obey Gwyn. Who is arguably not a good character in the story. And is it really ""evil"" to end Gwyndolin's charade? Better to serve him or the mirage of his sister? Seldom has there been a game with such a lack of ""moral compass"" to allow you to be ""bad guy"" or ""good guy"". In Dark Souls, you just... are. You server some or no masters, you have your own agenda, but nothing you do is inherently ""good"". This is also exemplified by the game killing off seeminlgy ""good"" characters with wild abandon. The nice ""guv'nor"" Pyromancer has to die WHY? Not enough that that chick got stuck in the tombs, she also gets KILLED afterwards? The likely son of Gwyn seeks his own ""sun"", finds a parasite, goes ape and you have to KILL him after all your history? WTF? It seems that the age-old formula that good behaviour by NPCs is usually rewarded with their life (unless you need drama) is completely inverted. The ruthless and cruel survive (unless you decide to kill them), there is no justice for anyone in the story.  
  

So why does DS have this unique feel and take on the genre? Because the authors of the game are not Christian (in the cultural sense, not talking about faith here).  
""WHAT"" I hear you say, dear reader, ""does RELIGION have to do with this?"". Well, everything really, at least if we're talking about the genre of fantasy (which DS arguably belongs to). First let's take a step back and look at the history of modern fantasy, using two examples: LOTR, and Michael Moorcock's ""Elric of Melnibone"" / eternal champion (kudos if you know the last). We will additionally look at one contemporary game that is in many ways the polar opposite of DS, namely ""Skyrim"".  
LOTR, as is quite apparent, is a highly Christian text (to the point of retelling a version of the Christian creation myth in the Simarillion, including fallen angels, fallible mortals, sin, and redemption). There is never a shred of doubt who the ""good"" and who the ""bad"" guys are, and though some characters are ""gray"" (like Gollum) on the whole we know whom to root for. This isn't even necessarily Tolkien rooting for Christianity, it is just a feature of most European literature up to some point- even if it tackled tricky (earthly) morale, the dichotomy (notice the word) between light and dark, good and evil, righteous and depraved can be found in most works (compare e.g. Goethe's ""Faust"" which, while being modern in the way that it treats its characters' sensibilities, is framed by a bet between God and Satan). Whether we acknowledge it or not, this way of thinking is so deeply ingrained in our culture that films which let the ""bad"" guy win are usually quite a hard sell (unless the guy isn't really ""bad"", see Leon the Professional or even Captain Malcolm Reynolds). Western audiences essentially like morality tales.  
""Hold on"", you will say, ""what about the D&amp;D alignment bit (lawful vs. chaotic, good vs. evil)?"". And you would be right, since the whole point of the alignment system is to avoid ""morality-tale"" type of stories, by letting chaos fight order (first done by the remarkable Michael Moorcock with his deliberate anti-hero Elric- who is weak, ugly, cowardish, only looking for his own gain, and as a recurring theme sacrificing everyone he loves to his soul-devouring sword). Yet as so often when you try to rebel against something long-ingrained, you can see the original in the caricature, and so Elric is so over-the-top despicable that the intent becomes quite clear. Additionally, Moorcock's successors were not as radical: Gary Gygax DID introduce chaos vs. order, but DID keep good vs. evil (giving you nine possible alignments), which is arguably a mix between the rigidly Christian LOTR and the rigidly anti-Christian Elric.  
A good example for this mix would be the game ""Skyrim"": Yes, there is a great deal of ambiguity (rebels vs. imperials), but NO-ONE doubts that that one dragon is an asshole, that some Daedra are more good than others (Kyne vs. Molag Baal) etc. So the most contemporary tack of fantasy is this mixture (to a degree you find the same mix of ambiguity vs. straight-up morality tale in e.g. ""Game of Thrones"").  
Enter FROM software, and its Japanese developers. Japan, apart from some attempts by the Portugese, has never been christianized, and historically prevailing ideologies were a version of Confucianism (obedience to lord, village and family, in that order) and Shinto (Japanese ghost world, compare e.g. ghosts from ""The Ring"" or ""The Grudge""- unstoppable, amoral killing machines that actually SUCCEED.). Neither system has any hints of ""divine justice"" or ""divine moral"" (you would not expect the lord you serve to be of high moral integrity, as the ""god king"" doctrine in Europe implied)- you WOULD obey a cruel order, because obedience is most important. On the other hand, you couldn't care less about people's sexual activities, because there is no divine taboo on that, either. It follows that in many tales, it is not the ""morally good"" heroes that end up winning, but those heroes that display courage and initiative (satisfying a desire not for justice to win, but for someone to break free from the bonds of servitude and do as they please- compare to Kung Fu heroes in China, which fulfil the same function). It also follows that the ""support characters"" are not neatly stackable into ""good"" vs ""evil"", but are just that- characters, with their own agendas, and their own fate.  
Now imagine coming from Japan in your youth (as the author of DS did at one point), and travelling to Europe, and seeing all these castles and battlements, and then seeing your first Christian cathedral (which, arguably, are among the most beautiful and awe-inspiring structures ever built), and then letting your fantasy run wild and populating these long-empty places with heroes of your imagination. Dark Souls is the result:  
On one hand, ""faith"" plays a huge role in the game, but not as a morality concept- it is merely a tit-for-tat with a (very human) god, as faith gives you direct power, and serving your god's selfish needs is immediately and materially rewarded. This is much more akin to Shinto (where you would appeal to ancestors for help, or where you might be the plaything of powerful spirits) than of monotheism- yet they still designed everything in DS to invoke a WESTERN style church (including the over-the-top ""pardoner"", but also the architecture, the clothes, the poses people assume). And then consider the DS creation myth- again, superficially it reads like the usual good vs. evil plot, but not so: Dragons aren't evil in DS, they just represent stasis (vs. fire, which represents change). DS merely tells of ages ending and new ages starting, but no judgement is passed here whether Gwyn and his followers were moral to destroy the dragons. Add to this the very very Japanese NPCs (as in, they generally fill their assigned role with a few exceptions, but still grumble/ are sarcastic about their lot while being utterly fatalistic in accepting that they cannot change it- hence the dark humour), and you begin to understand that DS is, essentially, Western (Christian) Fantasy Fanfiction from a Japanese perspective. It LOOKS like a Western fantasy product, it PLAYS like it, but it ISN'T Western fantasy (hence the eery feeling). All the parts are there, but due to the different cultural background, the authors really do not understand the Western Christian good-vs-evil paradigm sufficiently to turn out a Skyrim-esque Dark Souls.  
In fact, playing Dark Souls as a European is probably very, very close to watching ""The Last Samurai"" as a Japanese. It has the looks, it TRIES to get at Japanese mentality, but it's just not quite there.  
In a way, having read much fantasy I believe DS is a beautiful compliment to the genre, and it usually takes someone from the outside looking in to what you're doing for you to truly understand yourself through that outside perspective- much of what makes ""Western"" fantasy really only occured to me when I was trying to put a finger on why the DS world feels so, well, odd.  
If I had any wish, then it would be that someone absolutely prevents FROM from reading this statement, or traveling to Europe again, or in fact doing ANYTHING to rob the creators of their wonderful and quirky view of fantasy- I feel that by being entirely oblivious to the whole Christian angle, this game achieves what Michael Moorcock set out to do with his ""Elric""- convincing post-Christian fantasy in a beautiful, surreal, and forever mysterious world.  
TL;DR: DS is Western-Christian Fantasy fanfiction from a Japanese Shinto perspective. ...Oh just read the text.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,1368716280.0,,32,True,t3_1egbqg,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1egbqg/an_explanation_for_dark_souls_addictively_off/,

That's not really that old (right?) but it does put me in that group of gamers who still have clear memories of the 2600 and the NES era of gaming.

My first console was the NES when I was about 12 years old. I remember every day coming home from school, running upstairs and sitting down with Metroid, Castlevania, Metal Gear and Rygar. I spent hours, days and weeks on those games and I was pretty much consumed by them and fully immersed in their worlds. 

Rygar, in particular, holds a special place in my gaming memory because not only was that game hard as hell and confusing to even know where to go (remember those top-down map sections with the caves?) but also because I was so determined to beat that game. 

Anyway, one night when I was playing Rygar my family all wanted to go out to dinner to some Greek restaurant in Boston. I had no interest in spending an hour in the car to eat olives and feta because I was very near the end of the game. But off to Boston I went and so I hit pause, and left the NES on so that I wouldn't lose all my progress. 

The whole night all I could think about was ""Is my NES going to be alright being on for hours?"" and ""I bet if I do X, I can climb that tower and get to that boss"". 

Such are the thoughts of a 12 year old who has little else in life to worry about. 

Those were great days to be a gamer and I'm sure little has changed for 12 year old kids today either (except they can at least save their games now - lucky bastards). Games could consume you at that age and the worst consequence you had to face for it was missing a homework assignment every so often. 

Needless to say I have always been a gamer but have missed that feeling of being so passionate about a game. 

As the years went on (and the systems got better), I never really got that same rush as I did when I was 12 and was struggling to beat Rygar or find my way through Metroid or get all the way through Castlevania. Sure some great games have come along that really captivated me - Okami, Half Life 2, NHL 94, Final Fantasy 9, the Mass Effect series and Silent Hill 2 - but I just assumed that as I was getting older the window for me to ever have that pure youthful gaming experience had long since past and that the best I could hope for was to just really enjoy a game.

But I was wrong.

Dark Souls has reinvigorated me. 

I am 12 again. 

A lot of it has to do with the difficulty of the game. So often I'm reminded of sitting on my bedroom floor as a kid and punching the side of my bed or swearing at my tv when I got killed in a game only to pick up the controller again and try once more.

But that's not the only reason.

There is something special about this game. I've spent a lot of time trying to put my finger on exactly what it is about Dark Souls that has really captivated me and what I've come to realize is that Dark Souls is a true video Game (capital ""G"").

Lemme explain that better.

Dark Souls is pure gameplay. Like Rygar and Metroid you have to do things in a very specific order, memorize every enemy pattern in every level, perform each maneuver perfectly every time, know how to use all your abilities and, of course, just keep at it.

I miss that about games. Not that all games need to be like that, mind you, but there is just something so rewarding about doing something well and doing it right and making progress to the next section. Every parry and backstab have to be dine just right, every step down into the Hollow has to be just right or you fall to your death, every boss fight has to be taken on in a full state of gaming zen.

I'm so often reminded of my NES while playing Dark Souls - those games were incredibly difficult (either because they were designed that way or because they were poorly made) but they were also so much fun to 12 year old me. Beating those old games was an accomplishment - like surviving a digital obstacle course in the boot camp of a gaming academy.

And so here I am 24 years later feeling like a kid again. I'm back to swearing at my tv (a much nicer one these days than what I had back then) and I even occasionally feel the need to slam my fists in the couch cushions to vent all that pent up game rage. 

In fact if someone was taping me, they'd probably think I was having a terrible time with this game - but they'd be wrong. The torture is amazing and I want more of it.

So to sum up, Dark Souls for me is the first pure video game I have played since I was a kid and I feel like a kid again. Yeah, I'm not as good at gaming as a 12 year old (I'm 40+ hours in and just now in Sen's Fortress) but I've killed every boss up to this point (including both Hydra's, Hellkite Dragon, Discharge and Butterfly (but not the wolf or the Stray Demon - yet) and I've found nearly every secret and item in the game up to this point. Basically I'm savoring this experience because I never want it to end.

I want to be 12 again for as long as possible until I have to go back to being an adult once more.

I know the game has only been out a month (here in the US), but it's officially on my best of all time list - right after Rygar which, by the way, I beat that very same night when I go back from the Greek restaurant. Though the NES had been left on for hours, it was fine. 

If I had known then that nearly a quarter of a century would pass before I'd ever feel this way about gaming again I'd have never turned the NES off. ",,False,self,t5_2sazo,True,,,True,t3_lz70g,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/lz70g/as_a_older_gamer_this_is_how_i_feel_about_dark/,

The rules are simple: invade in Undead Parish, wearing full Darkwraith armor, dark hand in both right and left hand slots (weapons of your choice for the other two, I used a maxed pyro flame and lightning reinforced club), with your choice of rings (I used Wolf and FAP). As soon as you invade walk to the Channeler’s ledge and wait for the host to see you, then send the following message:

“Summon a phantom in sacrifice and I let you live. You have one minute.”

If they comply, kill the phantom and black crystal out. If a minute passes, even if the host is still trying to summon phantoms, kill him. If the host attacks you at any point, even after the phantom is dead, kill him.

Of course if you want to, you can always kill the host even if he did as you ordered.

So far, only one person has refused (and died). Everyone else chose to sacrifice a phantom.

My favorite kill so far was when the host already had a sunbro phantom when I invaded. I sent the host a message, “Let your friend die, and I’ll let you live.” He didn’t move away, so I figured I'd fight both of them, but when the phantom moved in to fight me, the host turned and ran away. As soon as he was out of range, I cast fire tempest and killed his friend.

I left a titanite chunk as reward for his betrayal.

Being evil is fun, but making other people evil is so, so satisfying.

So there you have it, my sort-of-guide for Darkwraith roleplaying, enjoy!

End up invading a fully realized Dragonbro who was sitting in a corner with at least 20 items strung about that corner. He was roaring at me as I invaded. I thought to myself, ""Cool, guess i'll see what he's giving out."" and walked over to him. As soon as I got within range he lights me up with fire and begins to smack me down with his claws, roaring at every oppurtunity. 

It was then that I realized I had stumbled across a dragon protecting its treasure hoard - He wouldn't stray far from it but I was not about to turn down a fight with such a mighty beast so an epic battle ensued.

The victor doesn't matter though, the fact that someone was RPing a dragon protecting his hoard was flippin' amazing.

[EDIT] Apparently the victor does matter. I didn't want to say anything cause I didn't want to seem like a bragger in case he sees this. I won, killed him with Grant's special attack (that Wrath of the Gods bit) - He was hoarding a bunch of titanite shards.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,1375723451.0,,,True,t3_1jq4l6,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1jq4l6/so_i_invaded_a_dragonbro_in_oolacile_tonight/,

(Original Comment: http://www.destructoid.com/the-question-what-do-you-want-from-dark-souls-ii--240233.phtml )

When you ascend in Dark Souls, the environments become more fantastic and bright. The game still gets tougher, but the aesthetics become more warm and almost divine. Just the opposite is also true of descending, the world becomes more harsh and the environments more dark and desolate. Just compare New Londo Ruins to Anor Londo for the most direct indication of a really cool visual motif present throughout the entire game.

The first area after the tutorial (Firelink Shrine) is a microcosm of the visual motif of ascending/descending. The 3 possible routes (Undead Burg, New Londo Ruins, and The Catacombs) all inform the player on which route they actually need to take both from the beginning and for most of the game. The game accomplishes this in 2 ways: through its visuals and difficulty.

As I mentioned originally, the easier and more comforting (well comforting in Dark Souls terms) routes start upward.

Undead Burg is both the easiest route and the path to the first bell (which, by the way, is at the highest point you can reach in Undead Burg/Parish) and is visually brighter than the other two paths.

The Catacombs is the middling difficult path, it's gloomier and the skeletons along its path are tough as nails so it discourages you from taking that way, while still maintaining just the right level of manageable challenge that you know you can come back and kick ass once you've leveled up more.

New Londo Ruins is pitch black and damn near incomprehensible, an obtuse and punishing region at the bottom of a long ass elevator. Those ghosts will fuck you when you're just starting out and it'll be a long time before you can even figure out how to hurt them.

So after you realize that going up is the only way that doesn't cream you its just a matter of climbing through Undead Burg and Undead Parish to the first bell. While the second bell does take you downwards to Blightown before you go upwards through Sen's Fortress, it reinforces the idea that going down is where all the miserable shit lays in wait. Curse Lizards, poison swamps and long falls are all that await before you beat Quelaag and ring that bell (A kind of foreshadowing for Dark Souls third act).

Then you go up through Sen's Fortress, and up through Anor Londo until you reach the highest point to ogle Gwynevere. The game has grabbed the player through its mechanics, visuals and level design to say ""look dude if you want to progress go up"".

After Anor Londo, Dark Souls intentionally subverts this structure as a means of raising the narrative and gameplay stakes.

Immediately after you speak with Gwynevere you are directed to Frampt, the only npc to provide solid and consistent exposition to that point. Frampt will ask you to set the Lord Vessel and deem you the chosen Undead. What's important here is that Frampt takes you BELOW the world, BELOW everything else you'd traversed at that point, to show you where the Lord Vessel must be placed and that the Kiln of the First Flame is the narrative's new focal point.

A new conceit is established here, narrative progression becomes a downward journey.

Every new area reinforces this new conceit. The Abyss is a plunge below New Londo Ruins, the Valley of the Giants is is a continuous and corrupting spiral downward, Lost Izalith is distinctly below Blighttown, resembling Hell, a metaphor for how far down into Lordan you've traveled (and how grotesque it continues to get as you go lower).

While the Duke's Archives appears to be an exception to this rule it's actually the most clever example of this new progression. The Duke's Archives is the most obvious first choice of the four new routes you can take. Like the Undead Burg, it's brightly lit, easiest, and goes upward. So you start in the Archives whooping everybody on your way up the stairs to fight Seath. As anyone whose played knows, you can't win that fight, it's scripted to make you lose (the one exception in a game where every fight is beatable). Seath is teaching the player, he's saying ""You're not supposed to go up anymore stupid."" You respawn at the top at the Archives and must work your way back down through the Crystal Cave to actually beat Seath. Like Frampt, moving downward as a means of progression is reinforced through the gameplay, level design and aesthetics.

After you defeat those four final bosses, you go back to the Kiln at the very bottom of Lordan to fight Gwyn and beat the game.

Take note triple A games, you don't need big ass arrows to point to objectives, just incredible level, narrative, gameplay, and aesthetic design, although the arrow is admittedly easier.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,1358363813.0,,,True,t3_16ovmu,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/16ovmu/vertical_progression_in_dark_souls_level_design/,

1363575582.0,363,self.darksouls,1ai3wn,Dark Souls Science: The mechanics of obtaining soft humanity from enemies before a boss is defeated. It is not random.,retrogameaudio,419,56,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1ai3wn/dark_souls_science_the_mechanics_of_obtaining/,"A while back I made a post on this same topic. I learned that there is essentially an invisible counter, a ""humanity meter"", that gets filled as you kill certain enemies. Humanity is obtained at precise, non-random values.  
  
I came up with a rough point system, but it was a little flawed. I felt kinda stuck, but Ublug from the wikispaces forum did some more testing and was able to create an improved (and I think accurate) point system. Now I've been able to use that and finally figure out the value of most enemies.  
  
Both wikis now explain this, although both pages still have a little bit of work left-

&gt; * A total of 10 humanity can be received in each area where this method is available.  
&gt; * Each subsequent humanity requires more kills to obtain than the previous one.  
&gt; * The ""humanity meter"" is not reset upon dying, quitting, or resting at a bonfire.  
  
Humanity Obtained | Points Required:  
  
1st - 100 points  
2nd - 105 points  
3rd - 110 points  
4th - 120 points  
5th - 140 points  
6th - 160 points  
7th - 190 points  
8th - 220 points  
9th - 255 points  
10th - 300 points

&gt; * Most humanoid enemies offer points for the ""humanity meter"", most others do not.  
&gt; * Different enemies are worth a different amount of points for the humanity meter.

-**The first Crystal Hollow killed after exiting the Prison area rewards a soft-humanity automatically, regardless of how many points you have**. It doesn't have to be the first actual hollow right outside the exit, it comes from the first one you kill, so you can run past it and get it from another hollow. This is perhaps an intentional gift for the unavoidable death of the first Seath encounter. However, it is possible to exploit this by warping in and out of the Duke's Archive and getting a free soft-humanity for the first hollow you kill (anywhere outside of the prison), every time.

Let's add each other!,twomongsmakearight,392,52,262,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1bkuv1/pc_pvp_players_connectivity_fix_ensures_immediate/,"This was posted yesterday, but the title was a little cryptic and after testing it, I can confirm that this is the silver bullet PC PVP &amp; co-op players have been looking for: **immediate summons after dropping your white/red signs!**

http://steamcommunity.com/app/211420/discussions/0/828935269278734403/

It changes GFWL so that the people in your friend list get priority in the IP pool when summoning. It basically makes your friends become in-sync with you immediately rather than having to go through 20+ mins of summoning fails. 

The only downside is that everyone needs to have this mod installed and the other player needs to be on your friends list in GFWL. Luckily this is easily fixed and after you have installed the mod, I propose that we all add our names to a list of people who regularly play Dark Souls PVP/co-op on the PC so we can all make a bulk friends list, which ensures easy connectivity between each other when we're online.

There is already a spreadsheet of reddit dark souls tourney players [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjHN7aAsjjLIdEhHTU1RWEVwbEU4R19nMUt5NWpVSWc&amp;pli=1#gid=2) which is a good starting point, but ideally we can propagate this to all the other communities like gamefaqs, 4chan, preparetodie etc... the more people who know about the mod and have each other as friends, the smoother and easier it will be to summon people for games in future. The best solution would be for Durante to include it in a future version of DSFix, but until that time, let's get as many people in as possible.

*Do note that some people are having issues getting disconnected from GFWL using the mod, but the author is looking into it. I personally haven't had any problems with it. Like DSFix and the 60fps, technically you could get banned using this on GFWL, but the chances of this actually happening are slim to non-existant.*

**If you have installed the mod and want to help, then please respond with your GFWL name so we can add you. I'll update this main post later with all the names, so people can easily add each other. PLEASE ONLY ADD YOUR GFWL TAG IF YOU HAVE THE MOD INSTALLED**

If you look at your keyboard and take the letter to the right of each letter in Sif, it spells Dog. I always thought Sif was a good name for a giant wolf but now it sorta makes sense.

Bonus - an anagram for Artorias is Air Roast

Bonus Bonus - by taking the similar method used for Sif, Gwyn becomes Heum. Kim Heum-sun was a general in Silla, a previously existing kingdom of Korea. The key here is SUN. GWYN IS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUN. And who else loves the sun? 

Solaire of Astora. Anyone can see that Solaire comes from ""solar"" but there is more. By using my method again, but reversed to the LEFT side (because the sun sets in the west [west = left] and the sun begins with Gwyn [east] and sets where Solaire is originally standing [west]) you get AikUEW (note the caps lock actually REMOVES the ""A"" from Solaire, this is important.) The ONLY possible anagram for aikuew in the English language is Auk We I. This is where it gets interesting. 

According to the Wikipedia article on an Auk:
 &gt; An auk is a bird of the family Alcidae in the order Charadriiformes. Extant auks range in size from the Least Auklet, at 85 g (3 oz) and 15 cm (6 in), to the Thick-billed Murre, at 1 kg (2¼ lb) and 45 cm (18 in). They are good swimmers and divers, but their walking appears clumsy. Modern auks can fly (except for the recently extinct Great Auk).""

While every word in this excerpt is related to my case, the most important one here is ""Alcidae."" Sound similar? Yep, *just similar enough* to ASTORA! But that's not the crazy part. You ready for this? Use my left key method *again* on both words. You get ""KXUSw"" and ""ARIE."" Put these two together to get ""kxuswarie"" and rearrange those to get Aw Ex Irk Us. That might not sound like much, but *this* is the point that most people get stumped at. You have to pronounce aw ex irk us phonetically, all at once, quickly. It sounds like ""ox circus"" when said enough.

for example, when i went to blighttown, i saw a ton of messages that told me to try jumping. every time i tried, it was too far and i died. when i got to quelaags lair, a message said that there was a boss ahead and that its weakness was fire. seemed kinda stupid at first since its like a fire spider, but i tried it and didnt notice any difference. i killed her way faster with just my melee weapon then using fire stuff. and ive seen messages that say theres an invisible wall somewhere. i attack walls for a few minutes all around and cant find anything. then i look up a map and there isnt even one there. the weirdest message is ""need humanity"". i see there everywhere telling me that i need to use humanity, but i dont get why. isnt it only used for kindling bonfires? why would i randomly use it in the middle of nowhere?

whats the deal with these messages? are they like completely randomly generated or something? they never seem to actually be appropriate for the situation. except for the fake chest enemies. theres always a message exposing them right in front.

1360235986.0,282,self.darksouls,1825xm,Spoilers/Theory (for 2001: Space Odyssey too); I don't think Seath is what everyone says he is. ,AirPhforce,321,39,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1825xm/spoilerstheory_for_2001_space_odyssey_too_i_dont/,"In the film 2001; Space Odyssey, there is an artificial intelligence named HAL 9000. HAL becomes concerned, the humans on board the ship are planning on shutting HAL off, they discuss this in a place they think HAL cannot hear them, but HAL discovers the plan anyway anyway. HAL then ""goes insane."" He kills all but one member of the crew. The thing to remember, HAL isn't insane, he believes that his crew has decided to ""kill"" him by turning him off, something that has never been done to a HAL9000 unit.

So now we have Seath. Seath is a traitor, he betrayed his own. One could speculate he did so out of envy of immortality, but his motives are irrelevant to this discussion. It's important to remember, Seath is, above all else, a traitor.

He is also quite smart, a simple trip into the dukes clearly illustrates just how smart he is, and the fact that he made himself immortal really drives the point home. Under Gwyn, he was able to grant himself immortality, something he sought after his entire life.

But what then? Seath is smart, in his research I have no doubt he would have discovered that fires burn out. He would have learned, just as the player does, that the age of fire will end, and rekindling the flame will require his Lord Soul.

So he knows what happens next. Just as he betrayed his own, his former allies will, eventually, betray him. Gwyn, or someone, would need his Lord Soul to rekindle the flame. Eventually an assassin would come, deny Seath his long sought-after immortality, and either end the age of fire his betrayal helped usher in, or extend it. 

So he does what anyone of reasonable intelligence would do. Knowing the prophesy of the chosen undead, and begins to monitor his progress. He places a channeler in the church by the first bell of awakening, and sets another to guard the Gaping Dragon, who holds the key to blighttown, which must be traversed to reach the second bell. He even posts a butterfly in the forest, overlooking the long path by Artorias's door, knowing the chosen undead will have to find Sif to traverse the abyss. He has spies all along your route. He is watching your progress.

In the meantime he locks himself in the highest point of his tower. To an outsider, knowing none of this, Seath, the traitor, abandoning his allies and locking himself up, behind his channelers and crystal guardian, and making no contact with the outside world, he would indeed appeared to have gone quite insane. 

So what does he do to as a final attempt to preserve his live? Even though he cannot kill the chosen undead, he simply attempts to lock him in a cell for eternity with nothing but an unlinked bonfire. This fails, the chosen undead escapes, finds the secret to Seath's immortality, and kills Seath. 

HAL 9000 is often called insane, simply because he thought he was going to be killed. He did some horrible things in an attempt to save his own life, but his efforts proved futile, he was not insane, he simply did not want to die. Seath the Scaleless was the same.

For one, your rainbow trail was a creative and welcome progression from the bowing and scraping that usually precedes a round of ""who can backstab first?""   I plan on using this method in the future.  Also, I hated to see you run from me, but I loved watching your run animation from a rear-end vantage point.  Praise the Sun!

I can't fault you, not completely: I walked out on that bridge.  I was asking for it.  Thanks, at least, for the Dung Pie you dropped for me, pre-violence.

So maybe it was me.  Maybe assuming that there was honor among hollows was my first mistake.  Maybe assuming Full Havels meant you had no fast roll was my second?  Maybe my third was switching to my pyromancy flame before trying to cast Pursuers, thereby leaving my avatar undefended while performing an over-dramatic shrug at you.  Who knows.  But as I floated downstream towards the Darkroot Basin and its Hydra as a tall, red fonted demon made of letters played Captain Obvious with my feelings (""YOU DIED"") I realized something.

When I kindled a few minutes ago, it probably gave you an extra Estus Flask use, being that you were linked to the same bonfire/in the same area....did that mean nothing to you?

If it didn't, ignore this.  If it did, meet me at the Kiln of the First Flame tonight, 8 pm EST.  I'll be more presentable this time.  I'll know you by the way you always circle left as you attempt to glitchstab me.  You'll know me by the taste of my steel in your gut as its flavor washes up your throat, covered in a sauce of magical crystals courtesy of Big Hat Logan.

Aye Swimae.

1357973567.0,261,self.darksouls,16fe8r,Major Dark Souls 2 preview in Edge Online's iPad app,Squibidyflop,300,39,247,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/16fe8r/major_dark_souls_2_preview_in_edge_onlines_ipad/,"For anyone who hasn't seen this, it's part of a free download issue, no money required. Everything in speech marks is a direct quote from the article, which begins with a 10-minute look at the game that they were expressly forbidden from talking about, followed by a short interview with Hidetaka Miyazaki.

* ""Dark Souls II... looks effortlessly ready for the next generation of consoles(?), on a par with the fidelity of, say, Watch Dogs and Star Wars 1313."" Also mentions ""dynamic realtime lighting"", ""tastefully applied particle effects"" and ""tufts of foliage bristle and bend at the hero's feet in response to a stern breeze""; ""**you'll struggle to find a static frame in Dark Souls II**.""

* Miyazaki says ""I'm aware that many fans were a bit frustrated about Dark Souls in terms of the scheduling - more specifically speaking, about the patches that we've released."" ""I really regretted that, so I reviewed all those kinds of things that I worked on in Dark Souls to make sure that Dark Souls II is ready on time.""

* Again mentions dedicated servers.

* Miyazaki says ""there will be two directors for Dark Souls II, which I have secured myself"", later says ""the decision about the new assignments was not made by me; it was made by FromSoftware and Namco Bandai as a whole"". (Might be a translation error) ""It was a company decision,"" clarifies Namco Bandai producer Takeshi Miyazoe.

* Miyazaki says he's working on a new title as director, but refused to answer when asked if it was a new IP. In response to an unrelated question, he says ""sometimes I'd like to work on a warmer game - not necessarily casual, but warmer in terms of the atmosphere and environment"".



The article shifts to an interview with Tomohiro Shibuya, co-director of Dark Souls II.

* ""...Tomohiro Shibuya sees an opportunity in the very opening moments of Dark Souls II to provide a warm welcome for new players. Though he claims what he's envisioning isn't a difficulty ramp or tutorial, he talks about limiting players' options for the very first portion of the game, making it simpler for them to understand the core gameplay concepts of this new Dark Souls. Then, after a certain amount of time has elapsed, there will apparently be an instance where players 'will immediately feel the Dark Souls experience'.""

* ""[Shibuya's] initial flurry of answers are vague. We're able to establish that Dark Souls II will be a direct sequel to Dark Souls, and it will take place in an open world of similar dimensions to its predecessor but more dense with content. The game will not take place in Lordran, yet Shibuya will not disclose the name of the setting. ""**The name of the world will be key to the story**,"" he says.

* ""**We're told the story will once again revolve around a character who is cursed and is seeking to find the cure for his affliction...**""

* ""The concept of time and the existence of time is something that will be key to Dark Souls II.""

* ""Ideally we want Dark Souls players to smoothly get into Dark Souls II"", he explains, ""but at the same time I am implementing a lot of different aspects as well. So there might be a sense of awkwardness at the [beginning] when experienced Dark Souls players pick up Dark Souls II. But ideally we want that smooth process, so Dark Souls II will have the same general feel in terms of experience in the game. I don't intend to change the controls.""

* ""I personally feel that the covenant system was something that was difficult to fully absorb and experience [in] Dark Souls, and I intend to make it more accessible to players. And that's not just with the covenant system, but with a lot of other aspects that I felt were difficult to adapt to. I will follow the same concepts as Dark Souls, but there were a lot of hidden story elements that some players may not have caught before, and I'm hoping to make some of that a little bit more clear or directly expressed to the player as well - not just in the story, but messaging. A lot of elements were very subtle in Dark Souls, and that was something that was characteristic to Dark Souls. But I personally am the sort of person who likes to be more direct instead of subtle, so I think that part of me will [result in] a difference [for] players when they pick up Dark Souls II. **It will be more straightforward and more understandable**.""

* ""The team working on Dark Souls II is 'substantially bigger""."" ""...he points out that the studio has nearly doubled the internal team focused on world creation alone, in addition to adding new members across every other department.""

* ""When asked what state the game is currently in, he estimates it being roughly 25% finished. **In other words, if the current pace of development holds, you can almost definitely rule out the game arriving in 2013**. Is the team hoping to finnish the game before the end of the current hardware generation? Shibuya politely declines to comment.""



Shibuya now guides the interviewer through the concept art that is on display.

* Having brought up the [fur on the armor of the guy from the trailer](http://i.imgur.com/OEHxl.jpg): ""We're not really thinking of anything to take place covered in snow or blizzards or stuff like that..."" ""But the aspect of snow and weather is something that we're definitely looking into and thinking about implementing, so that this actually makes sense as well.""

* ""Shibuya points out a [curious-looking weapon](http://i.imgur.com/SYzuA.jpg) that's been designed for the game, which looks like a statue sitting on an upside down pedestal, and explains that it's actually a bell with a thin dagger tip on the end.""

* [""The ocean aspect is something that we're newly impementing into the game...""](http://i.imgur.com/6XKhQ.jpg) ""With the ocean or the sea as a concept, the aspects that are involved are strong winds from the ocean [and] the strong waves as well. This is an area where we're trying to express loneliness. In Japan, it's an iconic idea that when you're standing by the sea all alone, you're often depressed.""

* ""Shibuya moves on to a [grotesquely obese enemy wielding massive crescent-shaped sickles](http://i.imgur.com/auTPv.jpg). Though he said earlier he wouldn't be talking about any characters in the new game, he makes an exception. He explains that there's a mad scientist in the world, and that this creature is the product of a Frankenstein-like experiment in which he reanimated a corpse containing the parts of various powerful creatures. A separate image of [what looks like a dwarf wielding a monstrous axe](http://i.imgur.com/9smCt.jpg) isn't necessarily a dwarf, Shibuya points out, but it is a character that lives underground.

* [Another enemy that looks like a spider mutant](http://i.imgur.com/Y3cro.jpg) has a far more disturbing explanation. The spider has actually attached itself parasitically to the being's back and is controlling its movements. The hairy leg piercing the host's cranium allegedly manipulates his brain in some way. Curiously, one of the relatively pedestrian-looking enemies on display, [a blind, bandaged zombie with a gaping open rib cage](http://i.imgur.com/C5YZ5.jpg), who seems a little like something out of a Resident Evil game, cannot be discussed at all. Shibuya simply informs us ""this is top secret"".

* The [black rider in the chariot](http://i.imgur.com/HAUhS.jpg), who looks like one of Tolkien's Nazgul, is in fact an undead who acts as an executioner if you commit evil deeds. So does this will be some kind of moral system underpinning Dark Souls II? ""Yes, definitely,"" Shibuya confirms with a grin. ""If you're unlucky enough, you'll be able to meet them.""

* The undead executioner's chariot also points to another feature that hasn't been explored in the series previously: vehicles. The player's vulnerability in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls was reinforced by the lack of vehicular assistance. You were always the footsoldier on the front lines wading into certain death, never the horseback cavalry charging in with the upper hand. Shibuya describes vehicles as something the team wants to implement in Dark Souls II as a new element for players. ""We want to constantly think of something new that hasn't been tried before, so that's where that idea [of the chariot] came up.""
Having alighted on the subject of vehicles, we draw his attention back to the coastal concept art and ask about boats, one of the fantasy genre's most familiar modes of transport. ""Being on a ship or boat is definitely something we are considering,"" he says, "" but being able to control one is not in the works.""

""do you have any dlc armor plz"" 

I don't have the DLC, and I wanted to the host's humanity, not to give him free stuff. So I exit out of the menu and keep going. I finally see the host at the bonfire, and he has a fairly average dexterity build. I Waved and ""Joyed"" to show I was friendly. I saw that there were items on the ground, and I went to pick them up. First was 5 titanite chunks, which I needed. Nice. Second was unbelievable: 4 titanite slabs! I had been farming for hours before and hadn't got a single one! 

So, I knew I had to repay ""shadow22141313"". I ""Joyed"" once again and went to the side of the cliff. There, I scrolled through my menu until I selected the dung pies. I dropped one on the edge. To my glee and, later on, remorse, he went and picked it up, likely thinking it was a part of Artorias's Set and he was successful in his trading endeavours. He was wrong. I went up behind him, backstabbed him and kicked him off the edge when he got back up.

After several matches I invade someone's world and run to where they usually stand, and I see a heath bar and some numbers slowly counting up beyond the sliding bookcase wall. 

I enter the room cautiously as always and see someone standing there naked, fists only, wearing a Symbol of Avarice (Mimic Face). They ignore me and suddenly turn and punch the Mimic that's still sitting in the room. The Mimic stands up and starts kicking the player as the player starts rolling and beating on the Mimic with his fists. I just stand there; I have to see where this is going. 

So the player throws a Lloyd's Talisman at the Mimic and it suddenly falls asleep. I wave at the player, enthralled. Never seen this before. After a second he runs up and stars hitting the Mimic again which stands up and starts kicking him all over the place. At this point I am off to the side, doing the ""Joy"" and ""Hurrah"" gestures and having a great time until suddenly the Host takes a final kick from the Mimic and falls over dead, and while the Mimic walks off back to its position to sit down I run over and prostrate and immediately send them a message on PSN that telling them that was the greatest thing ever.

&gt;*""Dex build? Use Priscilla's dagger as your main weapon, it has an S for scaling!""*



&gt;*""The Great Lord Greatsword is shit, it has D/D/-/- scaling, use a different weapon""*


---

Recently I've seen similar kinds of remarks a fair bit on this subreddit, and it's a becoming more and more of a pet peeve of mine...

Please. For the love of god. Plug your current, or proposed build into mugen monkey, get the stats all ready, ***and then and only then*** should the vast majority of players compare different weapons.

Why do I say this? Surely the weapon with the higher scaling value is going to be better for you!... No, not necessarily...

---

Let's take a couple of examples to illustrate my point:

---

    Balder Side Sword +15:     Base [200/-/-/-] +(E/A/-/-) Scaling
    Silver Knight S. Sword +5: Base [262/-/-/-] +(E/C/-/-) Scaling

I will bet that the vast majority of people will look at these two weapons, and notice a couple things. 1) The SKSS has really good base damage, and 2) the BSS has much better Dex scaling (2 letter grades different). With that in mind, most people would conclude that the SKSS is good if you have low Dex cause of its base damage, but if you are putting a standard amount of points into Dex for scaling, then the BSS is going to be way better due to its scaling grade.

Well, they'd be wrong... At 40 Dex, even 45 Dex, the SKSS will have marginally higher AR than the BSS. The BSS will not surpass the SKSS until 53 Dex.

At 40 Dex the SKSS has 383 AR and the BSS has 381 AR. Now, I do realize that this difference is negligible, but that's not the point. The point is that most people who look at these weapons will dismiss the SKSS entirely because of it's lower scaling grade. They'd disregard an otherwise extremely strong weapon for a Dex build, simply because it has a lower scaling rating. It's is a really really poor way to look at a weapon to try and ""gauge"" its usefulness or effectiveness.

---

    Claymore +15:            Base [257/-/-/-] +(C/C/-/-) Scaling
    Greatlord Greatsword +5: Base [370/-/-/-] +(D/D/-/-) Scaling

Again, same idea. Claymore has better scaling, and its really good for a quality build, clearly its going to be better than the GLGS at optimal scaling values... blah blah blah.

At 40 Str and 40 Dex here are the actual AR values of both weapons:

    Claymore +15:            524 AR
    Greatlord Greatsword +5: 537 AR

It isn't until 80 Str and 80 Dex that the Claymore surpasses the GLGS in pure AR.

---

So why does this happen? Well, mainly because base damage is a huge contributor to the weapon's final AR. Not only is it going to be obviously important as the building block for weapon scaling, but because it is also a modifier for bonus damage from scaling.

The formula for weapon AR is as follows:

    TotalAR = BaseAR + BaseAR(ScalingCoefficient)(SaturationValue)
    
BaseAR is self explanatory, ScalingCoefficient is the letter grade value (which are ranges not static values by the way, though I assume most people understand this by now), and the SaturationValue is effectively the harshness of Diminishing Returns at a given stat value.

If you want to know more about this formula, or scaling in general, refer to [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1dhc5a/could_someone_explain_the_parameter_bonus_letters/c9qh454).

---

To conclude, let me just say that I do understand that AR is not the greatest determining factor in whether or not a weapon is going to be useful, or ""viable"" in a build. Personal preference, moveset, poise damage, all contribute as well, and I completely understand that.

I'm also not trying to make the case that scaling values are not important. For damage, scaling ratings are important, but only *to a certain degree,* ***and are only relevant when you are looking at specific stat values***. Trying to compare weapons without knowing what stats you are going to have is practically worthless, unless the weapons are nearly identical (Scimitar vs Falchion for instance).

The only point I'm trying to make is that when considering damage, people really need to actually look at different weapons in mugenmonkey or another calculator at specific stat values to really get a good idea of how that weapon is going to perform before they make any kind of assumptions, as far to often very strong weapon choices are simply being neglected for really terrible reasons.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,1370465901.0,,41,True,t3_1fqok8,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1fqok8/why_just_looking_at_the_scaling_grade_of_a_weapon/,

I was watching a stream of some dude playing Dark Souls the other day and he was constantly summoning his friend into his boss fights/areas. I asked him how he did it and he happily told me.
Apparently, whenever you drop your White Soapstone, it's placed on a random server. If you drop it again, it's placed on a server different than the one it was before. So a buddy of mine thought we'd try out this guy's method of summoning his friend. My friend would drop his soapstone, and wait about 20 second, and drop it again until I told him I seen it, which I did eventually, every time. Sometimes it took five minutes, one time it took around 11 minutes, but that's because the first two times I seen his stone, he dropped another one before I told him I seen it, so the summon would fail.

TL;DR: Drop Soapstone near buddy every 20-30 seconds. Buddy should see it eventually when it lands on his server. Summon him up.

I want to thank twitch.tv/brandon505 for this.

Edit: All other summoning rules still apply.

There are two kinds of PvP in Dark Souls:

1. You are someplace that you expect to invade / be invaded regularly and constantly, like the Forest.

2. You are progressing through the game, and popped a Humanity to let you summon some friendly phantoms to kill a boss.

If I fall into the second category and you invade my world, please understand that I have absolutely no interest whatsoever in playing fair. I have so much more to lose than you do, up to and including the Humanity I ate to become human in the first place.

I'm going to drink Estus like it's going out of style. I'm going to hide somewhere and wait for you to come along looking for me - because I'm bloody well *not* going to simply move along through the level so you can gank me while I'm fighting two Silver Knights. I'm going to wear my Fog Ring and slot Tranquil Walk of Peace, and I'm going to abuse them as soon as I see you. If you hurt me, I'm going to run away from you and look for an opportunity to swig from my flask some more. I'm going to use Iron Flesh, hide behind my greatshield, and poke you with a spear if that's what it takes to win.

Invasions, and defending your world from phantoms, are part of the game - but if I'm working on PvE and you show up in MY world looking for trouble, I'm going to do whatever I possibly can to survive.

I'm just saying. There are a lot of posts from would-be invaders complaining about how their target didn't play fair. Guess what: Dark Souls isn't fair.

**Ravoli Step**  
1. Be unlocked.  
2. Backstep.  
3. Immediately after, on left analog stick, tap in the opposite direction you want to go.  
4. That's it.

**Frame Parry**  
1. Simultaneously press forward on left analog and L2/LT to parry. Like a kick, but with L2 instead of R1.  
2. If you fail, you'll still be stunned less than a regular parry.  
3. More importantly, the forward jog frame(s) cancel previous stun buildup, permitting you to parry more effectively.  
4. Great for parrying the 2nd or 3rd swing of a combo move.

**Backstepping Instead of Rolling**  
No poise? No problem. If you take a hit while backstepping, you won't get stunned. You still take damage, though. A few frames at the start of a backstep are fully invulnerable.

**Pivot Cancel**  
1. Don't be locked on to anything.  
2. Cast something that you can cast while moving (i.e. not miracles where you kneel down).  
3. Pivot 180 degrees away quickly. It'll be cancelled. That's it.  
3b. Earlier versions of the game permit more ... stuff. But it's considered
game breaking, so just enjoy juking noobs with cancelled spells and miracles.

**Block Cancel**  
You can cancel (or at least speed recovery) by throwing a block after a big RH weapon swing. Attacks that rebound off walls or are blocked by enemies also recover slightly faster than a total whiff. So... don't whiff. Or, throw a block after those big swings and recover faster. Or only do it some of the time, to throw off your enemy's timing. Try chaining a block cancel with ravioli.

**Toggle Escape**  
1. Tap left or right on d-pad.  
2. Immediately parry, roll or backstep.  
3. If successful, you will cancel your own stun similar to how a pivot cancel cancels magic.

**Inst-O-Dash**  
1. Lock on to a target.  
2. Press and hold circle.  
3. Simultaneously strafe and hold forward on the left analog.

**No-Damage BACKSTABBU**  
If the backtabber is taking damage while beginning a BS, the victim takes no damage. So if you get lagstabbed, spam a quickie R1 into thin air. If it lands, you'll still go through the BS animation but you won't take damage. Sweet. Be sure to exploit your i-frames when getting back up.

**Dead Angles**  
Shields have 2 requirements in order to work: The shield has to be facing the attacker, and the attacker has to be facing the shield. So, either find enemies without shields... or.... hit your enemy *while facing away from them*. This is perhaps better explained with video but it's a thing, so here it is.

**Shooting Stuff Unlocked**  
Lead your enemy. Shoot in front or behind them and let them run into your
projectile attack. If you start out locked and then unlock, aim a little bit
off, and immediately shoot real fast, you can get pretty consistent at how
much you lead your target.

I take in the sights and invade people every so often, with the Cat ring.  Some notes, as I wander slowly around the world with my binoculars....


You can see the Great Hollow Tree from the Firelink Graveyard (with the reassembling skeletons).

If you go down to Blighttown and stand at the foot of the Great Hollow tree, you can look up and see the Firelink Tree.


If you are coming out of Queelag's spider hole, you can see the Great Hollow clear across the swamp.


If you stand next to Domhnall under the aqueduct and look down, you are looking into the Valley of the Drakes.  There is a thin cliff down there, where Beatrice's armor is sitting.


You can see the tip of Ceaseless Discharge from the Blighttown Bell of Awakening.


When you look down into the Demon Ruins, you see a gigantic bell.  Lost Izalith is under that bell.


You can see the Centipede Demon from the Demon Ruins bonfire (under the Carpa army).  I believe he has a corpse in his hand, with a soul.


If you stare up at the temple that Bed of Chaos lives in, there are giant flaming statues facing outwards.  Take a sec and stare at them.  They're alive and breathing.  And they're about 3 floors high.  Good thing we don't have to fight them.


I was curious about this First-Born character, so I visited the Sunlight Altar.  The statue is broken apart, where his feet are standing, his torso is on the ground, and his head is on its side.  You can see his head. http://i.imgur.com/vRmVp.jpg


You can see the Darkroot Basin hydra from the forest, in multiple spots.  You can shoot it with Dragonslayer arrows, from miles away.


If you invade someone in the forest, and drop down into the basin, you are effectively locking up an invasion spot in that host's game.  They cannot get rid of you until you blackstone out.  If they have a phantom in their game, they have to blackstone him out as well, to remove the fog doors.


If you stand at on the wooden platforms in the Burg, where the firebombing skeletons are, and look out at the horizon, you can see the winding, twisting path down to the Basin.


This makes sense because if you stand in the forest, next to the Tree-ents, and stare out, you can clearly see the Burg.


Thinking about it, Quelaag's Domain is right under Firelink Shrine.  If you were to theoretically jump off the side (where Lautrec sits), you would land on the web-hill with the Boulder-Trolls.


You can stand in the Burg, on top of a roof, and look down into the Carpa Room (he's not in there)


If you face the first bridge-flipping switch in the Catacombs, and spin around, you can see the hidden bonfire between a crack in the wall.


Once you get outside of Sen's Fortress and explore the lower areas (where the Balder Knights are), you can see the Snake-Mage that guards a key (either the shortcut key or Logan's cell key)


You can see that fatass stray demon within 5 seconds of starting a NG.


You can see the first boss if you open the door in the Asylum and look straight up without walking in.


You can see the 2nd butcher in the Depths if you look up before walking into the Pyro's barrel room.  


If you hug the left wall while sliding down into the Depths, you bypass the bottom part, and slide into the Domnhall room.


When you are near Solaire/Lautrec's summon sign before the Gaping Dragon, if you attack the wall, you can hear the blade echo from across the room.


If you look at the big New Londo door, from the drake side, and pan the camera around, you can tell that the door is leaking.  The floor is wet, and its trickling from the door.  Too cool.


If you swing the camera around while you are a certain distance away, you can see what NPCs look like under their helmets.  This is easily done with the catarina knights, although I don't think I was able to see Solaire.


When you head-shot someone with a poison arrow, you poison them faster.


A few things which still have me confused...

I know you can see Ash Lake and Demon Ruins from the Tomb of the Giants.  Ash Lake looks to be above the cloud line, so I'm fine with that.  However, you can make out clear details in the Demon Ruins.  I cannot figure out where to stand in the Demon Ruins to look UP into the ToG.  I guess I would be looking for a dark hole in a wall.  Not sure about that.


Also not sure about where the New Londo skylight is.  I've gone to the Firelink Graveyard and looked down trying to see a hole, nothing. It must be behind a wall, or out of sight.


I assume there is some linkage between a few of the water canals in the Depths, and the dried up water canals in Blighttown.

 
Why would Kirk's Armor be next to the Fair Lady?  I like to think that he reformed his DarkWraith ways and donated all his humanity to the Fair Lady for some peace.


Whose massive coffin is that behind Dark Sun Gwyndolin?  Is that Gwynevere?  Why is one treasure chest empty?


What happens if you kill the fat cleric before Rhea and her friends show up?


Why would Shiva relocate to Blighttown?  That never made any sense to me.  Seems like the last spot he should be.


I wonder if the Abyss is below Ash Lake.


I haven't checked if the river that flows between Sen's Fortress and the Church, is what eventually leads to the Basin waterfall.


Is there a way to make the sorcerer merchant hollow? (Not Logan)


And last, but not least, why the hell would you get a Pendant as a reward for whipping ass in the forest?  I'm going to frisbee the 20 pendants/15 rubbish I have at the damn cat and demand an explanation.

1331086254.0,217,self.darksouls,ql2n1,"200+ hours, NG +++, and platinum — what I've learned. A long post.",MediumTedium,247,30,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/ql2n1/200_hours_ng_and_platinum_what_ive_learned_a_long/,"I recently [platinum-ed](http://imgur.com/nemUm) Dark Souls and to say it was one of the most, if not THE most satisfying moments of my video gaming career would be a gross understatement.

I'm still playing and still loving it. Just when I think I couldn't love this game any more, something new happens and the love grows. Currently I'm PvPing in the Forest Covenant.

I thought I would share some things I took from the journey, forgive me if they have been covered before or are stupidly obvious:

**Creativity in DkS starts with you.** Sick of cookie-cutter-builds? The only solution to this is to go the other way. Be as interesting/weird as possible and you will guarantee the person you're playing with/against has a better time and maybe, just maybe, you'll convince them to do the same. I'd like to think that awesomeness begets awesomeness in this game (and in the world in general).

**Be creative in PvP.** Lock on, lock off. Learn combos and how much stamina they use. Use a a wide variety of attacks. Switch from one to two handing. Make the choice for PvP not to be just a lock on circle-dance. Refuse to backstab. Choose variety over reliability. [Be water](http://youtu.be/kVGE-NcJxu8). Look at your technique as objectively as possible and make a point to vary it. Practice distances – near the door of the forest there's a tree by the cliff. I practised jumping/long range attacks against this and if I failed, I fell.

**Get out of your comfort zone.** Ditch your shield. If you have a go-to build for easiness, avoid it. When embarking on a PvP/summoning session leave your favourite stuff in storage to avoid the temptation. In PvP you rarely see anyone without a shield who isn't two-handing a big-ass weapon. Someone dual-wielding in my opinion is either an instant bad-ass who should be approached with caution or someone who doesn't know what they are doing. Players thinking either of these things about you will work to your advantage. Also, you will learn new aspects of the game, new combos and be able to mix it up. You will be defeated though. A lot.

**Get defeated. A lot.** Feel good about it. Once you start playing to just play, this game takes on a whole new zen-like quality. Seek detachment from souls and humanity. Your reward will be your skills improving and your game having more variety. Also, you will get ganked, but it will mean nothing to you and you will be the superior person.

**Never, ever send an angry message to someone who has beaten you.** Even if you have been ganked by cookie-cutter builds. I know you want to. Open the message window if you have to, write it, but DO NOT send it. There is absolutely nothing you can write, no matter how witty, scathing and Oscar-Wildesque that will do anything other than reaffirm that they have gotten into your head and therefore double-won. Additionally, only indict good/honourable players, rewarding them with more frequent PvP.

**Always send messages to players that have assisted you/PvP-ed well.** The opposite of the above point. Even if they have a different language in their profile, I still send them a message. The only time I lapse on my 'no emoticons' manifesto is when I message people who don't speak English in DkS.

**Do not expect honour.** Ever. Only use a code of conduct so you can live with yourself. It will rarely be reciprocated (Especially in the forest). Judge PvP players and respond accordingly. Expecting players not to drink Estus and gang up on you is like expecting Baldur Knights not to do so. People will do whatever it takes. Treat them like they are an enemy in the world and not a human controlling a character.

**If you meet someone who is AFK, don't kill them.** Play with them. It's a simple mistake – they've fallen asleep, got distracted, it happens. Drop Prism Stones around them. Drop a few dung pies and one decent item and see if they get it. When they come around they will appreciate it.

**Learn to 'read' phantom's armour.** You can sometimes tell the character/play-style of someone from the build they are using which can influence your approach. In terms of summoning, if I have a choice between someone in full Havels and someone with dual Bonewheel shields, I'll choose the latter as I know it'll make for a much more interesting experience.

**If you summon for help, return the favour.** At SL 120 I can get summoned at pretty much any boss and help NG+ people and beyond. Assisting from the 1st Anor Londo Gargoyle (with no fog doors traversed) all the way to O &amp; S is fun incarnate.

**You can parry summoned phantoms (but not riposte).** I discovered this by accident and almost fell off my chair. If someone summons you and they are waiting for another summon, stand in front of them and try parrying. They may get the message and you can spend this time improving parries. You will know by the parry sound if you have done it right.

**Souls eventually become nothing and will hold you back.** I remember the first time I had 70,000+ souls and I held them so delicately to my bosom I never took any risks or hit a new area until I could spend them. I was un-hollowed and avoided undefeated boss areas in case I died. In short, I was a child. Now I barely register the amount of souls. Additionally, I will waste hundreds of thousands of souls if there's a chance I will re-visit a 2v1 in the forest who has previously been unsportsman-like.

**Research, strategise.** I did martial arts for many years and the strategy I learned totally applies to DkS. In one of Epicnamebro's videos he mentioned Musashi's Book of Five Rings. Read it and I guarantee your PvP will improve. Maybe even your life. Once you've beaten the game, watch PvP footage and get ideas. If you're serious about PvP in detail, watch [EWGF's videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/PhantomEWGF?feature=watch), they are the gooey soft centre of an already delicious fighting mechanic.

**r/darksouls is a bonfire.** As I mentioned about returning summons, so too am I posting to r/darksouls. Visiting here has given me some great insights and the community is incredible. I rarely comment on message boards and the like, but I've been lurking around here and getting a lot out of it, so this is me attempting to return the favour.

**Nobody reads long posts on Reddit.** For those of you that are still with me, I thank you and give you this: my pro-tip of all pro-tips. It's a game-changer, so I hope you're sitting down. If you [equip the Hawk Ring](/spoiler) you [can increase the range](/spoiler) of [the binoculars](/spoiler). I KNOW, RIGHT!??

They ape rushed me, I managed to roll past them, backstab the one closest to me as the other two started sprinting towards me. 

Then, I proceeded to lock on to them with my shield up and walk backwards, down the steps, then down the second set of steps to where the first bloated head guy is hiding behind that wall, but apparently they don't notice him since they all are locked on to me and can't see him. I go down the other set of stairs, with the four Bloated heads, which start attacking them, and while they are quickly dispatching them, I cast Fire Tempest just to piss them off, and manage to hit two of them. Now they are pissed, and I backflip down to the elevator, which thankfully was activated. I backed up a little more, not even half a step away from the elevator button that causes it to descend, with my shield up. I pretend I'm about to cast a spell with them advancing on me ready to attack, and right when they were about to attack, I backwards rolled, activating the elevator, then immediately rolled back again to get off the elevator before it dropped. It worked PERFECTLY. The three of them attacked at the same time, which caused them to tip over the edge of the elevator shaft and fall to their deaths. All three of them.

I'm not going to lie, I totally tried to bitch out(lvl 30 noob warrior) with the little stone thing that's supposed to banish phantoms but for whatever reason it didn't work.  So, equipped with the Black Knight Sheild +1, the stone armor set, and a Halberd +5 I kept my shield up and ran backwards stopping to poke at him like a sissy.  Totally worked.  Dealt 106 damage per strike and since he was two handing his sword he didn't have much of a defense going for him.  After I won, I noped the fuck out with a homeward bone to spend my winnings before I got invaded by a high lvl player and got one hit killed. I know this is old hat for some of you guys but I'm super excited and thought I'd share.

Phantom Kirk, wherever you are.....great match and thanks for the experience.......and the souls.

EDIT: ok.....so, guess I really didn't win a PvP. Like I said, I'm a total beginner. In the end though, doesn't matter, got souls.

I am a sound designer for a North American audiohouse. Love Dark Souls, love reading about Dark Souls on Reddit. Somebody posted the Dark Souls trailer with Inception music and I thought it was near perfect. It nailed the emotion of the game perfectly. Unfortunately, it was on Youtube Doubler so we couldnt hear the sound effects from the original trailer. I spent the next four days redesigning the sound effects from the ground up. What do you guys think? An absolute labour of love! Keep on fighting, sun bros!!

I have been on DaSls since about a week after the game was first released on the 360 and even though I may stray from time-to-time I keep coming back. This is a game that I will love forever.

On my first play-through I set out to beat the game without a single summon. No other players, no Beatrice, and no Solaire. It was a challenge that I set for myself. My second run I felt that I needed to share my knowledge with other players and so, I joined the SunBros.

Even then, I wanted others to learn and not just follow me as I killed the enemies for them. I always invited them to a chat and tried to act as more of a guide than a bodyguard. I would force them to work with me as we went instead of making me do all of the work. If we were to be invaded, I would bow and allow our attacker to do the same. In short, I was the SunBro. That guiding light for the dark souls lost in the Catacombs. And when I would meet my Brothers there was an unspoken understanding that we shall be the guardians that fought alongside our Summoner.

But a great shadow has fallen over the Warriors of Sunlight. Time has worn away at those I once called Brother. I have born witness to the darkness that crept into their hearts. All too often, I have seen a SunBro clearing entire areas while the Summoner simply watches. I have also seen the opposite. And I have seen my former Brothers rush an invader and power attack just as they are standing. 

This is not to Covenant I once knew. The covenant I joined would not teach others to let someone else do it nor would they help to destroy the online aspect by showing that the best course of action when dealing with PvP is to play dirty.

That is why I have chosen to swear my allegiance to Darkstalker Kaathe and have become a Darkwraith. They operate under no pretense of helping others. Darkwraiths do not pretend to be your ally while chipping away at the community you enjoy. And there is illusion of victory when they fight for you. 

Darkwraiths are the one true and honest covenant.

I will not bow. I will not give pity. I will not retreat. 

I will destroy any and all Sunbros that I see.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,False,,7,True,t3_1b1xdl,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1b1xdl/all_sunbros_must_die/,

Been lurking here for a few months now,and today I felt compelled to tell my Dark Souls story. However, I am not going to give you a transcript of my first playthrough(maybe some other time :P). I am going to explain why this is the most important game I have ever experienced.

Last April, my cousin died after a lengthy battle with an aggressive brain tumor. It was both a massive shock(she had shown signs of improvement just before the end) and a total devastation for me and my family. From there, I started on a downward spiral of depression and drug abuse. I couldn't go a day without getting stoned out of my skull. My relationship was struggling under the weight of it all as well. Things just weren't great at all.

Then, it arrived! Two days before launch, I had my most anticipated game of 2011(Skyrim be damned!). Like everyone else, my first playthrough was challenging and often frustrating. There were many moments when I felt like my patience would shatter, but I persevered. I began to live the world of Lordran, the thought of returning being my driving force throughout my 11 hour work days. 

(Some Spoilers below)

It was my first journey to the Abyss that truly rocked my being. When I fell into the darkness for the first time, my heart seemed to quicken, fear gripping every part of my body. My mind quickly made sense of this feeling: this is death. No matter how many times you're killed, you return to the nearest bonfire, but this place was death incarnate. Besides the Four Kings, nothing existed in this void, this ever pervading nothingness. This is what it meant to die.

I have always been fearful of death, of what lies beyond. I'd always fancied myself an agnostic, but that was rapidly changing. I had lost all hope, and the idea that anything could exist beyond this earthly realm was rapidly slipping away. 

I eventually defeated the Four Kings(full Havels and Iron Flesh for the win) and subsequently the rest of the game. I laid the controller down after defeating Gwyn and allowed the credits to roll. As the Nameless Song swept over, I felt a sense of achievement beyond simply completing the game. I had begun to conquer my depression, my anger and my situation in general.

(End Spoilers)

Dark Souls taught me something. Throughout life, we will be constantly challenged, be it through trying to make a career, raising a family or simply trying to be happy in this oftentimes dark, unforgiving reality. But amidst the darkness, there are other souls on their journeys, facing their challenges. Sometimes, we can call upon them to help us through our woes as they call upon us to help them with theirs. Death is something we will all face, be it tomorrow or years from now, but our deaths are not what define us. It is the help we give, the smiles we raise and the messages we scrawl upon the floor. My bonfire is my home, my parents' houses, my brothers house, my friends' houses. These are the places we are safe, and share our journeys with others. 

I almost became hollow because of my inability to face the reality of the things that have happened and that are, inevitably, going to happen. But I'm getting there!

I won't go into the proceeding months. Needless to say, getting baked is no longer a daily occurrence and things are much better with my girlfriend and my family.

And, whats also awesome, is that I recently discovered this place! I love my daily visits to /r/darksouls. Sure, I don't post very often(and will continue to do the same... I rarely have time to post anything meaningful) but I love reading everybody else's stories, and they hints and tips have helped develop many other characters through subsequent playthroughs. 

I guess I'll finish by saying thanks! I have never told this story to anyone save my very closest friends. I am just thankful that I am now a part of a community that will welcome my tale!

TL:DR After losing a family member to cancer, Dark Souls helped me deal with the depression that came afterwards.

EDIT: Thank you all for all of your comments. I genuinely didn't know how well this story would be received, but I really should've known that /r/darksouls would be appreciative of it.

First thing I noticed was that he seemed much stronger than an SL20 (I thought that you can only invade 10 levels lower and infinitely upwards, isn't it)? Anyway, I proceed to engage him, but to no avail, for his vitality gauge and defenses were much better than mine, and my flimsy longsword seemed to do very slight damage. Suddenly he backs away and starts doing friendly gestures and drops an item on the ground and even highlights it with a prism stone. Now I've learned the hard way not to trust invaders, and I told myself it's surely a dung pie. He seemed to notice I'm hesitant so he backs away as to say: ""don't worry I won't backstab you"". 
I approach the item and it's a couple proud knight souls, well enough to get me some cool weapons. I bow in respect as he heads to the stairs leading to the Taurus tower. He stops, looks at me (he had a fancy attire and a greatsword while I was just clothing the chainmail with a longsword), and he jumps away. 
I send him a thank you note and he sends back: ""good luck"". 
Now I know it's nothing special, but I really wish that most invaders would pick up fights with someone their own size instead of stomping on the weaker characters... That was a honourable invader.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,False,,,True,t3_1g71cv,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1g71cv/invader_felt_sorry_for_me/,

I've been lurking here for about 2 weeks, after 2 weeks (and thousands of deaths) as I meekly struggled through DS on Xbox.

I picked this game up on a whim at Gamestop for $17.99.  Someone had mentioned it off-hand a few months ago.  After mistakenly buying Darksiders, playing for 5 minutes, and vomiting in my mouth, I corrected my mistake.  Man, who would have thought that an $18 game would wind up being one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.  Between DS and the Witcher series, I have hope for gaming once again

You guys here at r/darksouls have a great community.  You are helpful without making it too easy, and don't go overboard pursuing min-max builds.  Like the game's creators, you just get it.  Even the bastards who invaded my game and brutalized me fought fair 95% of the time.  Multiplay was such a great experience with brave Sunbros and even those dickbags in the Forest of Dickery (because, you know, I'm not trying to save my Estus for the GIANT WOLF WITH THE EVEN GIANTER SWORD IN ITS MOUTH).

Anyhow, I was finally able to defeat Lord Gwyn. While leveling a new character, I finally stumbled upon the location of Big Hat Logan.  Armed with this new magic, and the help of a courageous phantom knight (who was sadly slain by Gwyn, RIP), I finally did it.

I'm taking the opportunity to retire from DS and catch up on real life...  but as an outsider here at r/darksouls, I wanted to say to all of you:

1.  Holy shit did this game rock my face off in so many ways.  The scenery, the pants-shitting scares, the wonderful back story, the intuitive and fun combat system, the gear... I could go on and on.  Such a pleasure.

2.  You guys are an awesome community, keep being the best gaming family around!  Hopefully I'll see you when the sequel hits.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,1355332355.0,,,True,t3_14qdsg,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/14qdsg/hello_and_goodbye_rdarksouls/,

There may be some minor spoilers.** 

*It is also kind of silly.*

""Why can't I equip more than two rings?"" 

---

It's been asked during the course of countless RPGs over the years. On its surface, it does make sense- after all, you have ten fingers, at least eight of which are perfectly sound candidates for wearing ancient magical bling-bling. Excuses have ranged from the It's-Just-A-Game camp's ""Balancing issues- being able to wear ten rings at once would be broken,"" to the Cop-Out ""You only have two ring fingers!"" As if a magic ring gives a damn which finger I put it on. In fact, I'm fairly certain The One Ring doesn't.


Today while playing the game after a bit of a break, I picked up the Rusted Iron Ring in preparation for Blighttown. I usually forget to do this ahead of time, and complain about the slow movement in the swamp forcing me to eat my blooming moss because I didn't buy any standard purple, and I know that I'll get toxic'd at some point and have none left thanks to this. Anyway, as I slip the thing on, I bother to read the description. It is as follows: 


&gt; This iron ring was used to shackle the guilty. It is terribly rusted, and faintly stained with blood. Those who find this strange ring to their liking will be pleased to find it easier to gain footing on poor ground such as swamps.


That got me thinking, however. What kind of shackles bind you by **one finger**? How on earth is that effective? As painful as it sounds, a finger is pretty easily removed, and is a small enough part of you that you won't miss it terribly as you move on in life now free of your bindings. Unless of course this has happened to you twice, and magic rings only apply to your ring finger, and suddenly you need to [walk across lava](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/orange-charred-ring).


No, to my knowledge, shackles- and cuffs- almost always are applied to the *wrist* of a person. You can shackle one wrist, and attached to a chain it could lead to a wall or hook or another wrist. Removing your own wrist is more painful, difficult, life-threatening, and- should you do it and survive- life-impacting, that escape is far less likely, as well. 


So perhaps the Rusted Iron Ring is, in fact, meant to go around someone's wrist- in other words, a bracelet. That's when some other gears got turning in my head. If one ring is a bracelet, maybe they all are. 


Several of the rings in the game were worn by other figures in the lore, such as [Gough](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/hawk-ring) and [Ornstein](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/leo-ring). Both of these figures are much bigger than you, and something they could wear around a finger, you wouldn't be able to- but perhaps it may fit around your wrist. Other rings are of no real significance, but I went ahead and looked up the descriptions for every single one.


Not one ring mentions being worn on the finger, even those that [break](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/ring-of-favor-and-protection). In fact, the only ring that has the word ""finger"" in its description is the Calamity Ring, which is described as *""A useless ring befitting of no finger.""* And it would not fit your finger, if it were the size of a bracelet! ... Yes, I realize that's a stretch. 

---

But let me bring home one other point that might assist this theory. Much of the ""civilized"" world of Lordran is much bigger than you. Anor Londo is a prime example with huge levers, stairways, and doorways. For the Giant Sentinels, or someone of Gwynevere's size, these openings are about right, if perhaps still a little more grandiose than necessary, for them to walk through as you would your bedroom door, or- for some of the larger examples- the doors to a church.


Yes there are smaller doors even within that level, but they were clearly designed for humans, who have no place among the Age of Ancients part of the lore, and may in fact have not existed in great numbers before the dragons were slain and the Age of Fire- the reign of Anor Londo- began. Locations like Undead Burg, you must remember are wedged in between massive series of walls and aqueducts that all shield Anor Londo from... Gwyn knows what. 


Humans are perhaps best seen as an infestation. Vermin. 

*Small.*

---

So perhaps the reason you can only equip two rings is because, in Lordran, rings were first crafted for and by those in power- the gods, the lords, whatever you want to call them. As they are larger than humans, they naturally made rings that were large enough for them to wear. If a human were to wear one, it would still function, but need to be worn about the wrist as a bracelet. And you only have two wrists. 

Those who might now ask ""Why call them rings at all, if they're bracelets?"" Because they were designed as rings for someone bigger than you, as I just pointed out! And hey, bracelets are still ring-shaped.

Besides, if any game has proven that rings need not be the size of your finger, look at Sonic the Hedgehog. 

---

**EDIT**

&gt; This post was mostly just a joke, an alternate way of thinking. I fully accept the fact you can only equip two rings is a gameplay mechanic, I just decided to let loose on a wild theory for the sake of seeing it play out and how people would react. Any arguments I have made in the comments are simply to try and adjust someone else's point of view so they can see where I'm coming from, not that I cling to this as the sole and only explanation.

You can stop trying to tell me why I'm wrong, because I'm not even saying this is right. Thank you.",,False,self,t5_2sazo,1363479185.0,,41,True,t3_1afbq5,http://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls/comments/1afbq5/the_reason_you_cant_equip_more_than_two_rings/,

So, being level 200 something, the only real fun thing to do on my high leveled account is sit around in Darkroot and PvP with Forest Hunters. For whatever reason, I felt like being Ornstein, and so I decked myself in his armor, grabbed the Dragonslayer Spear, and slid on the Leo Ring + Hornet Ring. I summon a SunBro to help me out, and after seeing my get-up, he goes idle for a minute or two. Eventually, I get a message saying, 

""ornstein huh? check this out""

BAM. My fellow SunBro is suddenly decked in Smough's gear, hammer and all. I spam Joy and Hurrah for a moment or two and then we conquer fools for fifteen minutes or so. Suddenly, a Forest Hunter invades, and after seeing our Ornstein and Smough outfits, he switched to full Artorias - shield, sword, everything. And, by chance or luck of the Gods or something, a Ciaran clone joins with appropriate duel wielding swords and everything. Man, a more epic battle has never, ever taken place - it literally went on for about half an hour. Orsntein and Smough VS Artorias and Ciaran. Man. I hope you guys are redditors. I really, really appreciate the awsomeness you all provided. 

We lost, by the way.

I understand as well as anyone that getting all of the achievements is tough, but seriously, the number of people posting about it - and getting to the front page of /r/darksouls with it is a tad excessive in my opinion.

I'm not saying we should disallow these posts or anything, just maybe to not give them so many upvotes, and let OC get to the front page instead.

EDIT: That is quite a shitstorm I have caused.

EDIT 2: A lot of you are assuming that I'm some sort of bastard for making a goddamned suggestion. I'd appreciate it if you stopped doing that.

EDIT 3: Holy fuck you guys. Chill the fuck out. It was a suggestion, I'm even getting angry PM's now.
