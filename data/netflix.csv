To save money, she cancelled our Netflix account as we didn't use it enough to make it truly worth it, and we could save $15 a month until the wedding. 

Well, shortly after cancelling the account, she saw that we were billed by Netflix for another month. Sure enough, we found a DVD we'd forgotten to return to them. Ready to punch me in the head, she mailed it back hoping to begin her savings NEXT month.  

Then, shortly after receiving the DVD from us, Netflix REFUNDED OUR MONEY. We never asked for it back, actually assuming beyond a doubt they'd say no even if we WERE to ask. Maybe I'm so jaded by how companies refuse to admit their customers even have a POINT, never mind being always right, but this was nothing if not shockingly refreshing. 

I then told my betrothed I would be paying for the online service from now on out of the small allowance I take out of my paychecks these days, because Netflix is a great company, and they need the support of people like us to offer any kind of challenge or alternative to Comcast/DirecTV. 

That's pretty much all I've got, hardly page-turning stuff. However, I'd like to think I'm helping a great company like this stay moving forward in a time when corporate mega-giants from space like Xfinity attempt to squash them at every turn. I hope you all continue to do the same.

Since you all know, some content on Netflix might not be available on all regions, and all of us want to get the most of our Netflix subscriptions, so I took the time to build this simple script for Hola, with which you can switch between the following 6 Netflix regions (currently, hopefully more soon):
Netflix USA, UK, Canada, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark.

All you need is [Hola Unblocker](http://hola.org) installed in your browser (awesome plugin) and [the script that I made](http://hola.org/unblocker?hscript=ccd652c20a5f98e8&amp;sites=netflix-us+netflix-gb+netflix-ie) (if you cannot download it over the hola site, I have also made it available on [pastebin.com](http://pastebin.com/G0ANusEy)).

After you have installed both Hola and the script, you will see the options listed in the hola unblocker panel. Make sure you activate one region of Netflix at one time only, otherwise the script might not work.

Now for the content. I have discovered this awesome site called [Moreflix.com](http://moreflix.com) (I believe through reddit :) ), where you can search for content and it will show you in what region of the world it is available on Netflix. For example, the movie ""UHF"" is available in the UK region, and you can instantly stream it, by just switching on the UK button for Netflix in the Hola control pannel.

TL;DR
You can switch between 6 regions of Netflix by installing [Hola addon for your browser](http://hola.org) and [this simple script that I made for Hola](http://hola.org/unblocker?hscript=ccd652c20a5f98e8&amp;sites=netflix-us+netflix-gb+netflix-ie)

I'm a 31 yr old dude's dude &amp; I would normally look at a show that is pretty much all about women - and in which the only male characters are mostly badly written/acted - as not really ""my thing"" nor interesting to me... but this show is different. 

The writing is A+ all around; the flow, the timing, the characters, the flashbacks. Superbly crafted screenwriting. 

The directing isn't going to wow you with artistic shots, but there is a lot to be said about getting the mood and timing right. This is absolutely *crucial* for the comedy part of any dramedy and the directors nail nearly every funny moment. (Also, TIL that episode 3 is directed by Jodie Foster and is her first time ever directing an episodic TV show).

The dramatic scenes are just as good if not better than the comedy... though comparitively much more scarce. The scenes between the wife and her husband 'turned' transsexual are incredibly deep.

The casting is really *really* good (sans the male corrections officers) &amp; I haven't seen a character as intriguing as the transsexual inmate in any show in a while (who BTW is actually played by a real transsexual inherently adding much deeper realism to her character). 

The comedy starts off kind of weak and dry, but the laughs progressively keep getting bigger and better (An evident advantage of a show designed a full season at a time and not predicated on supergood pilots  getting picked up by networks which then fake its substance buying time until the season finale). Very few comedies can get me to literally laugh out loud alone in my apartment; I don't frequently express my amusement so usually one legit 'LOL' from me typically means the show is funny enough to be considered hysterical by most... and this show has pulled close to a dozen out of me already in just the first 5 episodes. For people who prefer smart laughs over slapstick, you will not be disappointed.

Simply put -- If you liked the first season or two of Weeds, you **will** like this show.",,False,,t5_2qoxj,1373666729.0,,,True,t3_1i62kv,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1i62kv/orange_is_the_new_black_is_really_really_good/,

Transcript of conversation with a Customer Service Rep in description.,miskatonicraft,172,32,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1d83sn/new_subscribers_to_netflix_are_not_being_given/,"*Netflix

Hi. This is [name removed]. How can I help you today?

*You

Hello! I am accessing Netflix from my computer, but I can't seem to add movies to my instant queue, and in fact, don't seem to have an instant queue on my account at all. I have signed up before, and have had one, so I don't know what the issue could be.

*Netflix

Hmm. That sounds pretty weird. Lets get to the bottom of that for you. Who am I chatting with today?

*You

My name is XXXXXX.

*Netflix

Hi XXXXXX. Let me check on this for you right now.

*You

I appreciate it, [name removed]. It is very strange, haha.

*Netflix

While I'm checking on this, how is your weekend going so far?

*Netflix

No worries, we'll get it figured out for you.

*You

It's been pretty great! It's my first weekend off in awhile, so I'm taking it slow.

*You

How about yourself? Have all your chat clients been friendly today?

*You

I have a few friends who work in chat support, and I know it can be difficult at times.

*Netflix

Ah that's pretty cool I use to never have weekends off. It's my Friday though. And yeah, everyone has been pretty nice today, thanks for asking!

*You

Well, that's awesome! It's nice to have a few days off to look forward to. I'm glad the day has gone smoothly for you! Let's hope the trend continues :).

*Netflix

Thanks! I'm still looking into this for you XXXXXX. I appreciate your patience.

*You

My pleasure, I'm in no hurry. I just thought it was strange, and that I should probably start building what is sure to become my unrealistically long list of things I plan to watch, then subsequently don't.

*Netflix

Ah I see what happened. It looks like we are trying some things out with some of our new members, who usually wouldn't know what the site is like. So sadly, there isn't an instant queue for you. No worries though. I'm going to send some feedback up to our engineers and pretty much let them know you need a list to store all your movies.

*You

Oh, interesting. Can I expect to be receiving an instant queue any time soon?

*Netflix

Well I don't want to make any promises I can't keep but submitting your feedback definitely helps change things. Especially since they know they're not fooling you. You know there use to be an instant queue.

*You

Hahaha, well I suppose that's all I can expect. I certainly hope that they choose to reinstate it, since I'm sure I won't be the only one to catch it. Having the ability to organize movies I'd like to watch, especially with such an eclectic selection is a pretty key feature to me. Please be so kind as to let them know that if they attempt to remove this feature, I will most likely not remain with the service for long. In contrast, you have been an absolute pleasure, [name removed]. Thank you for your help today :).

*Netflix

Hey I don't blame you, XXXXXX. It's like someone trying to feed you ground beef after you've eaten steak. Or give you no food at all in this case. I'm going to make your voice heard about this for sure though. Was there anything else I could do for you this weekend?

*You

I sincerely appreciate that, [name removed]! One voice at a time, I suppose. That is all I needed help with today, though, thank you so much for your assistance. Enjoy the rest of your ""Friday"", and your weekend! :D

*Netflix

Thanks. I appreciate it. Well I hope you continue to have a laid back weekend, XXXXXX. Take care sir. And one more thing, if you wouldn’t mind, please stay online for a one question survey.

I love my husband but I'd be lying if I said he wasn't a bit sexist... he's a typical 'jocky boy', always has been.

After much whining and sighing, he begrudgingly agreed to watch this with me. The first 10 minutes he watched it with his arms crossed and a sour look on his face, but by the time the first episode was over, it was clear he was getting into it. By the time the 2nd episode was over he said ""Okay, so this actually isn't bad.""

But it was the third episode that made him start crying! I was so shocked. I have only seen my husband cry two times in the 6 years we have been together; when our daughter was born, and when we watched 'Marley and Me'. 

[Very mild episode 3 spoilers ahead]

My husband has always tried to be open minded, or at least what he thinks is open minded, but sadly when it comes to transgendered issues, he's pretty much expresses his discomfort with the subject, and even hateful things such as ""They aren't REAL women/men"". It's always bothered me, and while he's gotten better over the years, he is still very ignorant about the subject.

So we're at the part where Burset is buying shoes for her son and then her old co-worker comes in and sees her, and things get awkward. When the son runs off, clearly angry, I hear a sniffle and look over and my husband is trying really hard to hide the fact that he's been crying! I paused the show and asked him if he was alright, and that just made him cry even more! 

My husband told me after a minute that it was ""upsetting to see, because the last thing a parent wants to do is bring shame to their kids, so for Burset to go through with this surgery despite knowing it was going to make him an outcast to his friends, family, and son...you have to be suffering a lot if you would willingly go down a path that makes everyone hate you for it.""

We talked for about 10 more mins before continuing to watch the rest, and basically my husband said that episode just made him realize that transgendered people just want to be happy and feel comfortable with who they are like everyone else. And if they feel like they're in the wrong gender, then that must be a terrible thing to go through everyday. Then he said that even though he would probably never understand people who go through it, it's still not okay for people like him to treat them like crap or treat them like their gender isn't 'real' just because in the past they were someone else.


I was so damn shocked hearing all of this! Shocked, but darn glad. However, when the episode went off, he said he felt really terrible because one of his old friends had come out to him years ago. He was looking for support, but my husband said it freaked him out too much, so he stopped being friends with him and hadn't talked to him since. 

So, I suggested finding him on facebook. At first he wasn't sure, but then he got more comfortable with the idea and finally decided to do it.

To make an already long story short, my husband found his old friend thru facebook and sent a long message. His friend was actually online, so they ended up chatting for nearly 7 hours! I'm really happy and even if this show can seem crude at times, if it helps people like my husband become more open minded, then I'll take it.

**tl;dr: Netflix opened my husband's mind, repaired a broken friendship, and provided us with many hours of laughter.**

I had issues with my payment (didn't realise I hadn't got enough money in my paypal / bank account). I couldnt get a manual payment to go through my end, so I rung them up. Not only was my call answered in under 30seconds, the issue was dealt with swiftly. I spoke to Rocky the first time who attempted to fix the problem (but the network was running slowly his end so I believe that's why it wouldn't process). When it still wasn't working I rung again and spoke to, I believe it was, Daniel who resolved the issue. Both of the operatives were genuinely interested in what I was watching, the weather here (I live in England) and giving me advice on what to watch. 

A true breath of fresh air in the CS world so this is an open compliment for any Netflix Call Centre managers, who may reddit, to see. If you'd like my email address so you can pass on my compliments and gratitude to those involved just comment or PM me.

The proxy generally takes a while to load, but once you're at the loading screen of the movie you want to watch, you can turn off the proxy.  This saved me from only being able to watch the first two seasons of the Inbetweeners, so I thought I'd share.

It sucks but I understand it is a necessity; it's impractical for a content provider like Netflix. I understand some titles can and should be taken down to rotate other titles in.

What I have an issue with is **they only give you a week's notice to watch movies and whole television series** with absolutely no warning. It is a hassle, it's inconvenient and completely contradicts the advantage of having Netflix in the first place: being able to watch shows and movies that is convenient for me. Instead I'm forced to change my viewing habits because of their inconsiderate and short-sighted system. 

The only short-term solution I have is to go through the old standby of torrenting the very shows they are denying me.

So with that said, is it totally futile to petition Netflix on this issue?

Matt Walton · Sacramento, California
Dear Mr. Hastings,

Every so often some genius with a crazy idea comes along and creates a product that is so brilliant it becomes an integral part of the fabric of society. These people usually have a bold and overreaching vision, an intense passion for what they do, a cocky belief that they can change things, and are willing to make the risky, bet-the-company moves that such a dream requires. Throw in a bit of serendipity and they change the world. You, sir, are one of those people, and Netflix is one of those products. You are one of my heroes.

When a product reaches the status of Netflix, it's a household name. It becomes the generic term for its entire industry. Your product becomes more than just what you're selling, your brand is your product. At that point, you practically have to kick your customers in the face to get them to stop giving you money.

Netflix is there. You've created a multibillion-dollar company that grows by huge amounts every quarter. You win. You did it. Congratulations! Netflix is invisible and indispensable. I've never been able to imagine not having it; it's like my electric bill. For some time now I've viewed Netflix as this untouchable company that would continue to grow and innovate, and slowly take over the dated cable-television empire. No one has come close to being able to compete with you.

I have been a member of Netflix since the summer of of 1999, before subscriptions started, when you paid per movie (twelve years!). I found your service after the frustration of paying $56 in late fees at Blockbuster once for a single movie. I was so furious, that I still get riled up thinking about it. I signed up for your subscription plan in December of 1999 and the first movie I got was Intolerance (1916) (for a film history class). I kept it for a YEAR! At first it was just because it's a difficult film to sit through. Slowly, the longer I kept it, it became a test of your ""no late fees"" mantra, almost like I was taking out my $56 late fee on that movie! I kept expecting to get an email from you guys asking where it was. Then finally, and triumphantly, it became an icon for the success of your business model. I was sold. I bragged about Netflix to everyone and would show them my copy of Intolerance (""No, seriously. No late fees, EVER!"").

I'm a very loyal customer and loyalty means a lot to me. In the last several years you've made changes that have made the service less useful to me, but the brand always won out. I just couldn't ditch it. You slowly started dumping all social aspects of Netflix. I used to love logging in and rating all my movies so my friends could see what I was watching and what I like. I would recommend movies to them and learn about great movies I've never heard of from them. It made my movie watching experience much more enjoyable. While the whole world was becoming more social and connected online, Netflix was becoming an isolated website I rarely logged into. Then you almost removed the account profiles allowing me to split my DVDs among multiple people, which is crucial to the way I use the service. These changes have resulted in me using Netflix less and less. I slowly stopped rating films because there was no one to show them to. Before long I realized the same 3 DVDs have been on my shelf for six months. But I still kept the brand. I still kept paying.

The industry has changed a lot since you started Netflix. There are now many options for watching content online. I've been an Amazon Prime member for awhile now and out of nowhere they started offering free movies. And iTunes selection and interface is amazing. Despite all my choices, I still choose Netflix. I just kept thinking ""That's nice, but I already have Netflix.""

You have obviously made some great decisions at Netflix as the company is wildly successful. You've made some decisions that seemed crazy at the time, like dumping your set-top box on the eve of its release, that turned out to be the right ones. And I know you think this change you're making is one of those decisions. You don't want to miss the boat on streaming and not be the premier company in that space. You think this is a brilliant and misunderstood move and that time will prove you right. And I really truly hope you're right, but I think you're wrong.

Some companies -- huge, untouchable, world-changing companies -- slowly drift into obscurity (think IBM) and some companies fall almost overnight (think Friendster, then MySpace). What makes companies fall overnight is a shift in the collective mindset. Such a change requires a catalyst, that kick in the face I mentioned earlier. For MySpace users, the kick in the face was Facebook. And once you get kicked in the face it shocks you into seeing things differently. It's like a spell is broken. And then, without even knowing exactly how it happened, yesterday you thought MySpace was irreplaceable, and today you'll never log on again. Shifts in collective mindsets topple countries.

For Netflix customers, our kick in the face has been a triple whammy. First, there was a price increase. This was obvious and offensive to many people because it was so huge. This one didn't really phase me. The second one was much more subtle and took a few weeks for its implications to sink in for me, the splitting of DVDs and streaming. By splitting them out, you created a new way of looking at your product. Before it was just a ridiculously large library of DVDs plus the added bonus of UNLIMITED streaming now and then when one of my shows or movies was available. It was a package that caused me to never think about either. Upon splitting I suddenly realize that they both suck for me. When I was forced to view DVDs separately, I realized I wasn't watching nearly enough to make the plan worth it. And when forced to view Streaming separately, I realized how deficient the library was especially compared to other options. It wasn't a viable product on its own. I could easily rent all the movies and buy all the shows on iTunes that I watch in a month and pay way less. Before viewing them separately I never cared about this.

Yet, still, after all this, and hearing the grumbling all over the internet, I was willing to stay with you. I was going to pay the new price for both plans and go back to not thinking about it. That was until I heard about the third kick in the face, Qwikster. Companies don't split up when they are successful. They grow and acquire. Companies have to be forced to split up by the government or due to seriously bad financial circumstances. Your shareholders have shown you what they think of Qwikster. The explanation you give, wanting to promote the products separately, doesn't make any rational sense. Everyone, from four-year-olds to 99-year-olds, knows what Netflix is and what it does. You could use that brand to sell anything even remotely movie-based. And trying to sell the skeletal remains that is left after removing DVDs as ""Netflix"" seems futile.

Why not use the gigantic cash-cow, that is DVD rentals, to fund the fledgling streaming business until that becomes a viable option? Everyone knows streaming is the future. Everyone wants that future. Eventually DVDs will die out naturally. You can't force the market.

Please, Reed, make the crazy, rash, impulsive decision to REVERSE your decision to split up Netflix. Give us back our old Netflix. Give us back the one thing that no one else was giving us: unlimited DVDs and unlimited streaming in a single package.

I love Netflix. And for the first time in twelve years I'm actually seriously considering canceling my account. Once my DVDs move to Qwikster, I won't even have ""Customer since December 1999"" on my account page. And while that seems petty, it means a lot to me.

Thanks for listening,
A Very Loyal Customer.
Matt Walton

This movie is fantastic in so many ways. For me, it's the thought of being afraid of beng alone on a subway in New York at night. Except, here you're with your gang and the whole city is against you. 

An additional layer is that of the human psyche to accept a lie wholesale and act upon it with great fury and vengeance. 

Ultimately, I like the scene with the sub par gang sticking up for its' territory. Along with the female injection it gives the feel of our ancient ancestors fighting over real turf that meant life or death.

If you're bored or disappointed with the first season, skip to Season 5 and go back to Season 1 later once you have a real appreciation for the show. If you watch Season 1, and you kind of like it but wonder where it's going, it gets a lot better fast. Overall, a pretty cool show if you like Sci-Fi type programs.

This is *incredibly* annoying. I've never once intentionally used the feature to preview a movie or show.

The worst is that it does this even immediately after you start the app. 

You can't start the app, then go into the other room to grab a drink or whatever. Once Netflix launches it will immediately begin autoplaying whichever random movie it lands on first.

Any way to disable this?  Anyone else annoyed?

My wife and I watch usually one episode or movie on a nightly / every other night basis.

My suggestions are littered with kid shows, and hardly anything else. I have gone through ""Tastes"" and told Netflix I don't want to see *any* kids shows at all. But still, those are the only things that get offered to me.

About the only way I can discover new shows is by using http://instantwatcher.com - but I'd much prefer to just stick to Netflix, especially since we tend to watch on tablets where it's annoying to browse the Instant Watcher site and switch back and forth. I guess if that's all I've got to work with, at least it's *something*, but geeze it seems like this is a huge flaw with Netflix.

Anyway... I figure I can't be the only person who has this problem. Anyone else figure out how to relegate kids shows to the ""Just for Kids"" area alone? Is it possible? Please tell me it's possible...

As an example, my recently watched includes Arrested Development, Star Trek, Doctor Who, Battlestar Galactica, and The Office.

Their remaining catalog of shows has really shrunk down dramatically, and they haven't added much of anything new in a long time (the newest series are from 2010).  
  
I can easily switch over to watching streaming through Hulu (which has a much larger and newer selection, subtitled), or Crunchyroll, or even Crackle. But it's still annoying when a major content provider like Netflix drops so much at once, so quickly, without explanation.

The studios make more money selling Netflix the actual DVDs than the rights to stream (duh). I asked him about the status of streaming content and what was going to happen with some of the titles that had disappeared and the limited library currently available. He said that those titles (Sony in particular) ARE coming back as well as a huge addition to the streaming library, and soon having all titles available for streaming. (Why this wasn't mentioned in the email that was sent to members or in their blog is beyond me.) I asked him if there was a plan in the works that would combine DVD and streaming (like before) in addition to the separate plans (rather than smashing two plans together for double the price). **He said that Netflix corporate needs customer feedback to justify continuing a dual plan.**

SO, Netflix using Redditors, lets give them what they need:

(866) 716-0414

Call and ask them to bring it back! Complain about the price hike, the limited library, the DVD only single episodes, etc. 

Nothing will happen otherwise. The reason large companies don't change or change adversely is because most of the time, people aren't doing anything about it. If we give them feedback and threaten to/actually cancel, perhaps we can save this awesome service.

1363045173.0,45,self.netflix,1a43lt,New Subreddit devoted to exploring the best of Instant Watch Television programming - The TGIF Club,TheHopelessGamer,60,15,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1a43lt/new_subreddit_devoted_to_exploring_the_best_of/,"/r/TGIFClub is a subreddit I've been thinking about creating for a while. I grew up in the late 80's/90's and was a big fan of the Friday night sitcom block of programming on ABC known as TGIF. I have a feeling I'm not alone in this.

Here's the blurb from the sidebar:
I have a goal. I want to build a community around enjoying the best, funniest sitcoms Netflix Instant Watch has to offer on a weekly basis. Every Friday night, this community watches the same single episode from four classic sitcoms and then comes here to discuss the night and each episode. That's it. To join in you just need to watch some of the best TV ever made and come here to tell us what you think!

There are two simple rules.

1. **No jumping ahead!** You watch one episode of each series each week. Can't wait to see how a very special two-part episode of Cheers plays out? Too bad. When these shows aired originally, the audience had to wait a week or more to get the next episode. In this (awesome) day and age of instant watch and blowing throw entire tv show seasons in a single weekend, we often miss the excitement of having to have patience for the next episode. This subreddit is built on the idea that this patience and anticipation is worth living with.

2. **No spoiling!** Given the very nature of what we're trying to do here, these shows may be well-known by many and are usually completed series. There's not much secrecy enshrouding these episodes and classic tv shows. Some big plot swings may be well known or big exciting/notorious episodes are upcoming (""How come he don't want me man?""), but don't blow it for people watching through the series for the first time.

As you can see, the purpose is to watch an episode from four different classic sitcoms every Friday night (not necessarily Friday but that's when the week's discussion of that week's episodes starts) and then discuss what you watch on the subreddit.

I think we all know one of the best parts of watching TV as it airs is to have a chance to discuss the week's episode with your friends. I want to bring this concept to watching the best Netflix has to offer on streaming.

**What do I need from you?**
I'm looking for help in getting interested redditors to subscribe and contribute their thoughts to the discussion. That's it. I could also use some help figuring out other subreddits to advertise to that might show some interest in joining the club.

This is at this point, at best, a half-baked idea I just came up with, so any ideas to improve upon it would be greatly appreciated.

One last thing. If this is something you're interested in participating with, please upvote this post for visibility so others know the sub exists. I'm only going to be moving forward with the idea if I can get a sizable group of people who'd like to participate. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qoxj,False,,,True,t3_1a43lt,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1a43lt/new_subreddit_devoted_to_exploring_the_best_of/,

Is it an exposure thing? Is it because some people in America are *crazy* for Doctor Who and Sherlock? I'm just really having a hard time justifying keeping my Netflix knowing that the selection on the UK side is not just vastly limited, but in these kinds of cases, flat-out robs us of titles we should be able to watch.

It somewhat does what its meant to do. It plays around 2 episodes before I need to hit play. However, it's a nuisance to have it ask you in the middle of an episode. I love Netflix because of the lack of commercials (I hate Hulu) but it's annoying to have autoplay pop up 10 minutes into a show or in the middle of a good scene. 

I understand that playing all the episodes with no one watching is a waste of bandwith. I've tried finding ways around the pop up by showing Netflix that I'm still on the computer watching it. 

1. I've moved the mouse and actively used the computer but it still pops up. This should show that I'm on the computer but I'm not sure if it's even possible for Netflix to detect mouse movement. 
2. I've clicked on the icon on the bottom right that appears once the episode has ended. If I'm clicking to play the next episode then Netflix should play it in its entirety but it doesn't.
3. I've paused and pressed play on an episode only to have auto play show up 2 minutes later. If I JUST paused it and played it, then obviously I'm still at the computer and want to watch the whole episode. 

In other words, there's room for improvement. While the feature is cool, it could have been implemented a lot better. I'd rather have to push play on each episode than to have my episode interrupted. I think the only way to achieve interruption free entertainment is to manually choose from the more episodes tab. 

First world problem maybe but I demand satisfaction. ",,False,,t5_2qoxj,False,,,True,t3_zx60f,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/zx60f/while_autoplay_initially_seemed_like_a_good_idea/,
1345743078.0,34,self.netflix,ypep8,Why are cable companies so terrible vs Netflix?,Dugen,48,14,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/ypep8/why_are_cable_companies_so_terrible_vs_netflix/,"I have Comcast with their horrible xfinity streaming which I pay 10 times as much as Netflix for, and I recently visited my sister who has Verizon Fios, who have much more bandwidth available and are trying to woo customers from Comcast, but their streaming is still just as terrible!

I really enjoy Netflix, not as much for movies but for TV show content.  I'm at the point where I wish I could pay Netflix 10x as much for access to more content and do away with cable completely.  

Here's the places where cable just fails:

* Commercials:  My time is worth a too much for you to waste it with commercials.   (Edit: my math was wrong.  It's 64 cents per 32 commercials, not 4 cents)  They get about 64 cents per 16 minutes in each hour they play commercials.  Netflix has never once wasted my time in that way.  It makes the shows more enjoyable to watch and makes me feel better about letting my kids watch what they want.  With the amount I'm paying these jokers for cable, they shouldn't be trying to force-feed me commercials either.  I'm the customer, not the product.   If you need to charge me 64 cents more per show I watch to get it commercial free, I'll gladly pay.

*  Selection:  Let me stream every episode of every show I have access to.  Maybe not every nightly news episode, that's not useful, but every normal show, if I'm streaming episodes, default to starting me at the first episode of that show and working my way to current episodes.  

* Tracking:  Remember where I was.  Remember what episodes I've watched.  This isn't hard.  If I watch a new episode live, remember that and let me know what I've seen and what I haven't when I'm looking through the episode list.

* Recommendations:  You know what shows I watch.  Recommend ones you think I'd also like.  It doesn't have to be all that complicated.  Figure something out.

* Pictures not Text:  This isn't 1980.  Providing a folder based interface with text names of shows and episodes is ridiculous.   Look at Netflix.  They do this right.

* Devices:  I can watch Netflix on my laptop, all my android devices, my Wii, and damn near anything that can play video.  Hire the programmers.  Get it done.

I think the problem is that cable companies see themselves as selling you channels, not as selling you access to content.  This is wrong, and has led to them ignoring the manner in which they deliver you that content.  I've had DVRs for 10 years now and it started changing the way I saw cable service and now with Netflix, it's obvious as a consumer where I want things to go.  

It's come to the point where I'm seriously considering cutting the cord, not because I don't want to pay for the content, but because Comcast is incapable of delivering the content I pay for in a way that's useful to me.  If you can't provide me content in the way I want, I'll save my money to give to someone who can.",,False,,t5_2qoxj,1345748874.0,,,True,t3_ypep8,http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/ypep8/why_are_cable_companies_so_terrible_vs_netflix/,

After this upcoming culling, they'll be down to just a few dozen shows available (from more than 200 at this time last year), with (currently) no indication that they plan to be adding new shows to replace what they have expired.  Looks to me like Netflix is quickly becoming a non-entity when it comes to the anime streaming market (at least in the US).  
  
Mind you, there's still plenty of alternatives; almost all of the shows listed above are available through other streaming services, especially in subtitled format (Netflix primarily deals in dubbed anime).  While Netflix may be exiting the anime market, all the other services are still going gangbusters.  There's Hulu and Crunchyroll, as well as Funimation's own streaming service, Crackle, and Amazon Instant.  
  
This little message is not really to get into an argument about which **legal** streaming service is best for anime viewers, or how good/bad/terrible Netflix is.  *It's really meant as a heads-up to anyone out there who is watching any of the anime series listed above on Netflix, so that they can get busy watching the rest of the episodes before they disappear in the next couple of weeks.*

I often visit the review section on a given movie I've just viewed, to compare my take versus another subscriber.  I have no idea how much value, if any, Netflix users place on the user reviews (the last relic of any social aspect of Netflix's site).  I don't know how much you like the reviews, but I check them out regularly, if not digging very far into the reviews for any one movie.  I'm becoming increasingly disenchanted with them, though.

However, any review that starts with something like ""Just saw this at Sundance....""; ""got a special invitation to the [American city] Film Festival....""; ""Saw this at Cannes special VIP invite-only...""

It's seriously distracting, &amp; causing me to focus more on the reviewer's Declaration of Status, rather than their review.  The reviews that begin with these Declarations of Status are not always bad, but after years of checking them out, I'm starting to think there's some sort of hivemind that's formed on Netflix that makes one think that if you don't make a statement of exclusivity at the beginning of your review, you won't be taken seriously.

We're all disc-renters &amp; movie streamers at the end of the day.  It is possible to write an engaging, &amp; intelligent review of a movie, without the disclaimer of how privileged you are, or that somehow because you saw a movie at a film festival, your take is more *valid*.

I imagine this crap is so prevalent because the ""top rated review"" is the one that almost always starts out with the ""I saw it at a festival before you"" cringe-inducer.  It's now a ""formula"", perhaps; the ""most recent"" reviews, with the unbelievable lack of spelling, punctuation, &amp; grammar, along with the sheer *laziness*, offer zero value.  It's not uncommon to see a lousy review (not to be outdone by the lousiness of the actual text) inspired by a *technical issue*, which has *nothing* to do with the rating of the movie itself.

Edit 2:  Based on what a couple of other people are saying it does seem like there is edited content on netflix.  The biggest problem I have with this is that it doesn't appear to be marked as such.

It's going to be like Zombo.com in here, anything can happen.

/u/DarthArshavin suggested that we use Rotten Tomatoes data.     
/u/kc_casey suggested that we group together set of queues so that you can organize them a bit better.   
/u/TheSystem_IsDown  suggests that we add a range function to the search, so from year 2000 to 2006 and return all the titles within that. Same goes for ratings and genres.

edit: 1 month later: It's in the works still. I'd make another post but it'd be spammy as heck I think. So the current features are still very limited, it's only got filtering right now, but I think we offer a pretty solid set of choices:

* title
* genre
* whether it's a movie or tv show
* mpaa rating
* runtime
* year



Looking at it, it's not that much, but it's enough to be proud of for now.

Similar to Anthony Hopkins as Titus Andronicus or Ian McKellen as Richard III, this adaptation is set in modern times.  Here a tragedy set originally around the 5th century BCE zooms into modern day.  Fiennes had acted as the lead in this play previously and decided to adapt it in his first project as a director.

I think, especially for a first-time director, Fiennes did an impeccable job.  The use of imagery beautifully condenses some of the words (this is one of Shakespeare's longest plays) and the resulting speeches are well delivered by great performers.

The supporting cast does tremendous work as well, including Vanessa Redgrave, Jessica Chastain, and Gerard Butler.  I think that Brian Cox as Senator Menenius, an aging and cagey politico searching for a point of compromise between a popular uprising and an elite, between internal and external threats.  And the most important piece in that game is realized in Ralph Fiennes' performance as well as his vision as a director.

Stellar drama with some absolutely amazing action scenes

Quickly looking at it, the pro's appear to be:

* Less expensive than Netflix streaming only
* First year is 50% off
* Free two-day shipping on Amazon-Prime items (which can be very useful on items where the vendor jacks up the shipping price)
* A free book to ""borrow"" every month
* It seems it might be a bigger library (not sure on this one)

1. Go to http://netflix.com

2. Sign in and click ""Your Account"" in the top right corner.

3. Scroll down and click ""Manage Netflix ready devices and computers""

4. Click the ""Disconnect Devices"" button. Confirm decision when asked.

5. Push the guide button on your 360 controller, then go left and click the ""Quickplay"" option

6. Go two spaces to the right and it will list all of your available Quickplay choices. Scroll down and click Netflix.

7. Netflix will give you a code which you must enter here https://account.netflix.com/Activate

Enjoy.

Also after activating you need only do steps 5-6 to reach Netflix again.

Multiple people on GameFAQs have confirmed that this works, and that it enables you to use parties again. However, you must select Netflix from the quickplay menu to see the old UI.

EDIT: I can personally confirm that this works. Make sure that when you open Netflix you're selecting it from the list on the ""All"" tab in the Quickplay menu on the Xbox Guide, **NOT** from the Quickplay menu on the dashboard. Party features fully work, and you'll be able to freely switch between the old and new app.

I remember that Amazon Instant Video recently acquired exclusive rights to new seasons of Downton Abbey, and I think they said that he would get exclusivity to all of Downton Abbey. It would not be outside the realm of possibility for them to get exclusivity to all PBS titles. I hope not, though.

**†It should be clarified that just because these titles are listed as expiring on July 1, it doesn't mean that they actually *will disappear* on July 1. Rather, it means that these titles are under a contract that expires July 1, which may or may not get reupped. This list should not sensationalize the loss of titles, this happens all the time, Netflix's catalog is constantly in flux. However, if you have been planning on watching any of these titles, it might be a good idea to check them out before July 1, just in case.**

EDIT: Added some more that I've seen, and sorted them a bit. Also, These are **NOT** listed as expiring July 1: 

* Sherlock 
* Call the Midwife
* Foyles War
* Half the Sky
* Ken Burns: Baseball
* Ken Burns: Civil War
* Ken Burns: Jazz
* Ken Burns: The National Parks
* Ken Burns: The War
* Ken Burns: The West
* PBS Kids titles like Sesame Street, Arthur, Curious George

EDIT 2:
From an [article that quoted this](http://www.webpronews.com/is-netflix-about-to-lose-a-bunch-of-pbs-content-2013-06), they have input from a source at Netflix and further clarification:
&gt;After speaking with a source at Netflix, I can confirm that Netflix is not losing PBS content in the sense that you will no longer see PBS content on Netflix. You will continue to see some titles. The source could not comment on any specific title, other than to note that Amazon did indeed get the exclusive deal for Downton Abbey. Any other titles on the list you may or may not see on Netflix after July 1st.

&gt;Basically, it’s business as usual. Netflix is doing what it always does. Some content comes and goes. Typically if enough people are watching a title, Netflix will keep it around. If they’re not watching it, Netflix will decide it’s not worth it to keep paying for it. In the case of the titles in question, most probably just aren’t getting enough views to make it worth Netflix’s money.

EDIT 3:
/u/Gnagus [has a list with other things that I missed](http://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1h6w2a/a_list_of_some_of_the_history_channel_and_pbs/), including a whole ton of old History Channel titles that I didn't see. So check that out for even more things that are going away soon.

Only two main characters appeared: Spock... and the ship itself. Everybody else was different. No Kirk, no Uhura, no McCoy (Bones), no Scotty, no Sulu, no Chekov. The Captain was Pike, and the rest of the crew was different people.

That isn't the reason to skip it, though -- it's actually a very good episode. However, it has nothing to do with the narrative, and what's worse, the _entire episode_ is included in the 2-part ""The Menagerie,"" where Spock, more or less, recounts the events of the episode, and nothing but the credits is left out.

_Trek_ purists probably love the fact that ""The Cage"" is included on Netflix for streaming, and good for them, it's a good episode, on its own. However, it's irrelevant to the story at that point for a first-time viewer, and ""The Menagerie"" puts it in a much better context. We don't care about Spock's first assignment before meeting the rest of the crew... but we do care why Spock does what he does in the 2-parter.

The alternative is, you watch and enjoy ""The Cage"" with the rest of them, but when you come to ""The Menagerie,"" it's boring because, as I said, it wholly contains ""The Cage."" You don't want to skip ahead because it's interwoven with the present story, and it's probably the best Spock episode so far.
