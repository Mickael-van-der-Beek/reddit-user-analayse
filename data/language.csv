I am a Dutchie, but truth is, I actually prefer speaking English and writing in English. Lately, I have begun thinking in the language instead of Dutch. All good right? Except I live in the Netherlands, and my nationality is Dutch. I am worried that by constantly using English, I may forget (or just worsen a lot) at speaking and writing Dutch. I mean, I write in English, I think in English, the only thing I do in Dutch is converse with my friends. 

Is this something I should be worried about? After school, I will probably see my friends less, and think more in English than before (no more dutch text-books).

I have this idea (which sounds probably a bit crazy) of collecting (and publishing....) a list of animalsounds around the world. For example, why says a frog in Holland 'kwaak' and in English 'ribit' and in Japanese 'gero gero'? Or why says a pig 'knor knor' in Holland, but in Germany 'oink oink'? While it's just the neighbour country!

Basically, it's the same animal but as soon as you cross a border it's saying something different (at least, that's how humans hear it). Sounds strange, doesn't it?

So the question is, can you help me with the sounds from your country/language? So a real animal sound / language exchange!

I'll give it a start with Dutch, to set an example. Hopefully more people will follow and can copy/paste this list of animals and write down what they say. 

Cat: miauw

Dog: woef

Chicken: tok tok

Rooster: kukeleku

Pig: knor knor

Cow: boe

Donkey: iaah

Bird: tjirp tjirp / twiet twiet

Horse: hinnik

Duck: kwaak

Sheep: beeh

Snake: sssss

Rabbit: snif snif

Goat: bee

Fish: blub

Owl: oehoe

Bee: bzzz

Mice: piep piep

Lion/tiger: grauw

Hope we can get a lot of languages!:) Please copy/paste the complete list of animals, so it will be as complete as possible with the sounds and languages!

Cheers!

Examples would include many fox news anchors, Ted Stevens talking about tubes etc ?

Similar words are:
Poseur -- for this the aggrandizing speech is with the purpose of endearing the audience to the speaker, while I'd like the purpose to be the manipulation of the audience towards some other end.

Tergiversate -- this is more equivocating to get out of a jam

Prevaricate -- perhaps not too far off in historical use as it may be antonym to advocate, but is currently related more to an answer than an unprompted diatribe.

Enter the [Linguarana Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/linguarana-extension/nnifnginpkbgimkcpcdkkcmcegojpcia?hl=en). It will define words you mouseover, and you'll hear the pronunciation of the foreign word at the same time. You can then choose to add the word to your Linguarana database to study later, or not. Used together, this is the perfect immersion tool for Chrome users. What's especially nice about the Google Immersion extension is that you can select your proficiency from novice to fluent; decreasing or increasing the amount of translated words. 

Both extensions have a huge variety of languages to choose from; I'm currently studying Swedish, and I've found my immersion has benefited greatly, whether I'm reading Google Immersion converted words on English pages, or trying to read the Swedish news on an .se site.

So I'm thinking a language which you already speak quite fluently, in my case English (or even Swedish, my native language). I use English-english dictionaries when I look words up but sometimes I don't remember words I know myself to have previously looked up. 

I'm looking at minimum effort per word. I know language knowledge never comes cheaply but some ways are easier than others. In my third language, japanese, it's still worth it to work the words into [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) because even though I have a fairly sized vocab (nowhere near fluent, but it's OK) it still doesn't come naturally to me - with English or Swedish however it feels a bit silly.

Any ideas?

EDIT: As for reading books, I'm already doing that. Read more about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/lr3x8/how_to_increase_vocabulary_in_a_language_youre/c2uxab3).

About ten years ago, I was fluent (not expertly, but could converse about almost anything without much effort). I realize that I need to memorize in context, language is living and changing, saying and colloquialisms are important, etc. No need to educate me on those points. I don't have the time or opportunity for regular immersion.

What I would like to hear are strategies for the memory palace technique when applied to a language systematically. I can come up with good one-offs, but I'd like to put together something more comprehensive that does not involve writing things down.

* ""Shall we see each other day?""

and various others, but it's these two I want to focus on.

In Italian, both of these are formed simply by appending a question mark to the statement:

* Ci vediamo oggi?

It occurs to me that there may be no obvious way of distinguishing the two English senses of this question in Italian. Clearly Italians manage to do this, so what do they write or say to make the meaning clear? Intonation or rewording?

I'm also a teacher, and thought this would be a cool tattoo.  I then asked a friend who gave this, much more detailed, definition of it:
&gt;Muad’dib, does mean educator. The thing is arabic does not translate easily into english so the meaning of the word educator does not encapsulate the meaning of the word Muad'dib. Since you are getting this tattooed i thought you would want to know more about it.   It comes from a root verb: 'Aduba' which means: to be well-bred, well-mannered, cultured, urbane, to arrange a banquet, give a formal dinner. But the form Muad'dib is a reflexive form of the actor of the verb, i.e. the person who instills culture, good manners, etc. in other people - an educator, man of letters, it also means a teacher in a koranic school. Also related to it is the word adab which means manners, humanity, lierature, moral decency, stuff like that. I'm trying to give you a flavour of the meaning 'cos educator is too vague.

He also, rightly, suggested that I should get it in calligraphy, as that would be much more beautiful.

I'm at the point now where I reflexively see people *not* using it and want to correct them. Here's how it works:


 - ""to"" - linking word; ""I am going *to* the store *to* buy bacon""
 - ""too"" - indicates excess; ""I ate too much bacon, too many times.""


And it bugged me that the word ""so"" really has two similar meanings:


 - ""so"" - indicates causality; ""I am eating bacon so that I will survive.""
 - ""so"" - indicates excess; ""I at so much bacon.""

And that's my problem. Here's my take on the solution:

""There was soo much bacon at that party, so I ate it all.""


I think this is a new usage for the word, that has come about over the last... 50-100? years. I don't think it was originally used that way; ""if you are so inclined"" is still using the connector form, but it's a bit hazier. I think the excess form, ""soo awesome"" is popular enough that some disambiguation is in order.

I began the argument with.. well were not taught that in schools, its not the correct sentience form or pronunciation that English was created from. I also argued that that's not how it is on any standardized tests. She argued.. that's cause its the rich white men who create all those tests and what kids are taught in school. Then I argued they should switch there ""registry"" to what is taught in schools and is on tests. She replied with well some people feel that will change their culture, you wouldn't change the way you spoke if that were the case. Then I argued I would change it in a heartbeat if it meant being more successful. By this time she was pretty heated and went from being in the front of out class to her desk telling us to work.

I'm a history major just finishing up my third year of University. My interest is in Welsh history and eventually I'm going to need to learn how to read and translate Welsh. Problem is, I don't know a word of Welsh. I've been looking at books and websites to help me learn, but they're almost all centric on speaking and/or listening. So, are there any decent sources out there for people who are specifically looking to learn reading and translation skills?

I'm going to assume, for cultural reasons, that this is a Romance language; also, based on prosody, we have two word-level morphemes, [ɡadːa] and [miːa]. We see the traditionally feminine morpheme /a/ suffixed to both, which we'd expect given that Morticia is Gomez's wife.

The second word thus resembles the first person possessive pronoun (my), feminine singular; especially in Italian and also, to a certain extent, Romanian. However, there is no noun that matches [ɡadːa] (or [ɡadːo]) with any relevance in Italian; with the possible exception of ""cara"" [kara], ""dear"". Thus, the closest match I can come-up with is the Romanian ""dragă mea"" [draɡəme̯a] -- which translates to ""my sweetheart"" -- which also holds *some* credence, with the Transylvania connection... That being said, it's a long shot: that's a pretty poor pronunciation, either of Italian or Romanian, if I'm right! (Also, isn't Gomez a Spanish name?)

1341666498.0,0,self.language,w6d7b,Something interesting from a Japanese/English speaker.,letsgetalong,5,8,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/language/comments/w6d7b/something_interesting_from_a_japaneseenglish/,"Well I got banned from the linguistics community for trying to have a conversation about linguistics, so I figured I'd try posting here.  This is my situation as a second language Japanese speaker in a Japanese environment.
--------------------------------------------
Over the past year, I have watched the teachers adapt to my existence, and learn how to explain things to the children based on what I say. The more that we have become able to communicate with each other, the easier the flow of my English class became. However, we reached a point where the adults clearly understood all of the ideas that I was conveying. Due to this, now if I explain a new concept to the teachers, the teachers seem to assume that since they can understand me, the children can understand me, and the ideas that I am conveying as well. This means that my job has changed from not only teaching English, but also determining the level of explanation that these children need. As well as creating a better interacting environment with the teachers in my classroom.

But children process information/language differently than adults do. I have learned that these children, ages 3-6, have absolutely no idea what the difference is between English and Japanese. They are simply absorbing it all as ""language"".

Meanwhile, the adults in my environment have watched these kids absorb everything very quickly since the beginning of this school year(April). They seem to suspect that the reason the kids are doing better at English is because I have improved as a teacher. While certainly there is truth in this, there is also a strong truth in the fact that language requires more than one person, and because my interactions with the teachers are smoother, the kids are having an easier time accepting the environment.

However, I have now reached a point that, if I do not communicate with the teachers about how to interact, then these children are not going to advance at English.

In the process, strong emotions have become involved, because as our communication has evolved, we have vested feelings in the situation. After a year and a half of working in the same environment, people are bound to create connections. Emotions and language are a very difficult topic though, especially for someone speaking a second language. Even in our first language, when emotions occur, we get confused, and don't know how to convey the message we are saying. In my second language, I find this incredibly exhausting, to the point it's still basically impossible.
Due to this, I am unable to properly communicate with my coworkers about my current thoughts on this situation. I don't even know how to fix it other than to level up my Japanese, but I cannot do this fast enough, so I have to think of something right now. It's a delicate situation.

However, in response to my inability to communicate in Japanese at the moment, rather than speech convergence, there seems to be an aspect of ""environment convergence."" My environment is trying to shift to make me more comfortable, but I am finding it more confusing. (If something along the lines of ""the aspect of someone changing their speech to sound more like you because they like you"" is not convergence, then does this definition fit?

My suspicion is, that because I am an adult, I am facing a very large barrier in my learning, and adjusting ability. This is of course more than linguistically related, but the biggest point is that: I have earned the trust of these people through interacting with them, and they have decided to trust me, and want to communicate as much as possible.
However, people who communicate in their first language... do it with ease. It seems to be just a natural process. (please tell me if I am wrong) I learned Japanese starting from age 17, and am just barely fluent/literate... I still can't understand 100% of everything happening around me.

Because these people don't understand the difference between first and second language ability, their view is: -This girl has tried very hard to become a part of this environment, it's time we try to adjust her into the situation. Let's talk more, and make the environment comfortable. My response (existence) is: -Of course I want to participate more, but because adults have vested emotions into connections, talking to them has become incredibly difficult compared to before. Furthermore, their efforts of merging to act more like me have confused me even further, because I had to spend a long time already adjusting to the situation as it was.

My abilities as a second language speaker mean that: interacting... talking, while performing another task is a completely new skill level for me, whereas for them, it is a natural action.

However, due to the concept of convergence(or something else?), they are trying to adjust to be like me. So if I stop working to talk to them, it means that they stop working too, and it becomes a distraction from getting the job done.

I would love more than anything to simply convey the difficulties of this to them, but no one in my work environment has this much of a comprehension about language. So this has evolved into an incredibly complicated situation.
