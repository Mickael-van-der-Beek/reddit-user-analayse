It says:

""For you who own this cart: keep it because this cart is one of the biggest relics of videogames on the planet. Anderson""

On the back side there are some information about this Anderson, like his RG (Brazilian identity number), date of birth, his ""title"" (Anderson the Biggest RPG ""Detonator*"" of Salvador**, a year (1994, I don't know why, since the game was released in '95) and his phone number (outdated now, but who knows?).

* detonator (detonador) is a Brazilian slang for a guy who is very skilled at something.
** Salvador is the city I live in.

Now I'm thinking about finding this guy just to tell him that I found his old cart and I'll take good care of it.
