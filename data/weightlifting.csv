I caught a North Korean guy walking towards a bar loaded with multicolored weights. Seemed dull, but the immense cheer in the crowd had me curious as to what I was about to witness.

And then, suddenly, the cheer goes mute. The weightlifter grabs the bar, the usual place , the familiar position. The tension became palpable. ""Can he do it?"". I felt a surge of nervousness in my gut. The serious face becomes a grimace of fury as the bar explodes upwards and I caught myself shouting ""Go, go, go!"" as the North Korean spread his legs and ducked under the weight for the final part of the lift.

Finally, slowly, he stood straight for the longest two seconds I've ever witnessed in an Olympic sport and a horn sounded and he released the weight together with a triumphant shout.

I was thrilled. ""He did it!"" The feeling was incredible, and I wasn't alone. The crowd cheered loudly as he walked offstage.

I immediately began to see how involving this sport can be. The purity of it all, the binary nature of the challenge. There's the weight, you can lift it or you can't and that's it. I admire the 100m dash for how fast and explosive it is... 4 years of training for 10 seconds, and just what a surge of emotion must go through a sprinter's head when he's on the block about to run, but this... this was significant.

Most significant was my relation to the spectacle. The crowd's relation to the spectacle. The crowd doesn't root against any weightlifter, they are there to catalyze the efforts of every single one of them. They celebrated a succesful lift and gasped and commiserated when an athlete failed a 3rd attempt. They cheered them on sincerely as they walked onstage, shouted encouragement, then fell silent to allow them to focus for the superhuman challenge ahead. And so did I.

Every single lift, an explosion of joy, a communion with the athlete. Words of encouragement across a computer screen.

Compared to this titanic and pure challenge, of man against himself and not against man, all the other sports felt dull.

I became a fan. I can't wait for the world championships. This is by far my favorite spectator sport of all time. I wish more people would just see it. It is a thrilling, powerful, positive experience.

It also made me do the basic lifts at my gym. Now I'm passionate about lifting also.  I'm too old to be significant, but I can still watch on the mirror and root for just another guy, just another barbell, another struggle. It's nice man.Hell of a sport. Can't wait to watch the world championships.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1cylax,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1cylax/an_outsiders_look_into_weightlifting/,

It's been an epic year in many ways, and weightlifting is definitely one of the big reasons why.

Last april, after doing SS for 3-4 months while dieting down from being a [fatass](http://i.imgur.com/BHeIIA6.jpg), I picked up Gregg Everett's book and perused it obsessively. This was the result:

[70lb Snatch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuBJSCItkf0)

[95lb Clean and Jerk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdv_Z9Ppd5w)

Those were pretty much maxes for that day. I missed a lot of snatches behind (in that gym, yikes, I know) and at the time, I was terrified of putting anything over 100lbs above my head. My best backsquat was around 240lbs.

In started training with Max Aita in Oakland soon after that, then I moved to NYC where I'm currently training with Artie Drechsler. Here are some recent PRs.

[100kg Snatch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O6SXKud7bQ)

[120kg Clean and Jerk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRtMWeXEw0g)

I'm pretty proud of this! I still remember when I couldn't even deadlift 265lbs for a set of two. I'm absolutely in love with the sport and I hope to make nationals in 2014.

I am excited to announce that myself and one or two other volunteers will be in charge of the judging. I may be entering, but if I do I will not be judging my own lifts, nor be eligible for any prizes(aside from flair, prizes with actual monetary value will be handed down to the next eligible winners, same goes for anyone unable to accept a prize).

I am still figuring out the details, and I am ***IN NEED OF PRIZES TO GIVE AWAY TO OUR WINNERS***. If anyone has any connections at lifting or supplement stores, or would like to donate money for a prize pool or to purchase prizes, please let me know. If you are not comfortable sending money via mail or paypal, you can drop-ship prizes to the winners.

This post is simply to get an idea of numbers, as well as any ideas you guys have to make this thing awesome!

*""What can I do to help?""* you may be asking yourself. Well, if you would even remotely consider competing, reply in this thread with a simple ""I'm interested"", along with a weight class and gender to get us started. If you want to help with prizes, do the same (or PM the mods to remain anonymous) and we can figure it out from there.

Thank you all for making this subreddit awesome!

Also, if you would like to help with judging, let me know! No more than 2 judges should be needed.

**Update 1:** With 25 competitors pledged, Cytosport has said that they will donate some products for our winners. /u/Loki090 has pledged a box of chalk, and/u/goingthruit has pledged cash. Thank you all! Spread the word!!!

**Update 2:** I am going to start formatting this thread as the official start date thread (ie with the rules, prizes etc) so that it comes as no surprise to anyone and we don't have any last minute changes.

**Rules**

**Snatch**
&gt; The barbell is placed horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped, 
palms downwards and pulled in a single movement from the platform to the 
full extent of both arms above the head, while either splitting or bending the 
legs. During this continuous movement, the barbell may slide along the thighs 
and the lap. No part of the body other than the feet may touch the platform 3
during the execution of the lift. The weight, which has been lifted, must be 
maintained in the final motionless position, arms and legs extended, the feet 
on the same line, until the referees give the signal to replace the barbell on 
the platform. The lifter may recover in his or her own time, either from a split 
or a squat position, and finish with the feet on the same line, parallel to the 
plane of the trunk and the barbell. The referees give the signal to lower the 
barbell as soon as the lifter becomes motionless in all parts of the body. 

&gt; *From the IWF Technical Handbook*

**Clean and Jerk**

&gt;The first part, the Clean: 
 The barbell is placed horizontally in front of the lifter's legs. It is gripped, 
palms downwards and pulled in a single movement from the platform to the 
shoulders, while either splitting or bending the legs. During this continuous 
movement, the barbell may slide along the thighs and the lap. The barbell 
must not touch the chest before the final position. It then rests on the clavicles 
or on the chest above the nipples or on the arms fully bent. The feet return to 
the same line, legs straight before performing the Jerk. The lifter may make 
this recovery in his or her own time and finish with the feet on the same line, 
parallel to the plane of the trunk and the barbell. 

&gt;The second part, the Jerk: 
 The athlete bends the legs and extends them as well as the arms to bring the 
barbell to the full stretch of the arms vertically extended. He or she returns the 
feet to the same line; arms and legs fully extended, and waits for the referees' 
signal to replace the barbell on the platform. The referees give the signal to 
lower the barbell as soon as the lifter becomes motionless in all parts of the
body. 

&gt;**IMPORTANT REMARK:** 
 After the Clean and before the Jerk, the lifter may adjust the position of the 
barbell. This must not lead to confusion. It does not mean the granting of an 
additional jerk attempt but allowing the lifter to: 
a) withdraw the thumbs or “unhook” if this method is used, 
b) lower the barbell in order to let it rest on the shoulders if the barbell is 
placed too high and impedes the breathing or causes pain, 
c) change the width of the grip

&gt; *From the IWF Technical Handbook*

**Lift Submissions**

Each competitor must submit a video of them performing a single (1) Snatch, as well as a single (1) Clean and Jerk. These videos must not be edited *in any way*, this means no title sequences etc., the submitted video must be the raw file from the video capture device. The lifter can take as many off-camera attempts as they like in order to hit a weight they are satisfied with. The videos must be shot from within +/- 30 degrees in front of the lifter ([shown here](http://i.imgur.com/iTNOKPb.png)). You cannot submit two videos for the same lift (ie if you are unsure if you pressed out a 160kg Jerk, you cannot submit a 150kg Clean and Jerk as well to be safe). A third video must be shown clarify the type of plates (kg/lb) being used, as well as the corresponding colours(black plates must be shown, legibly on camera). In any case of uncertainty regarding the weight on the bar *your attempt(s) will not count*. For this reason, you are advised to make it explicitly clear the weight on the bar, either before or after your attempt. A video of the lifter must also be submitted which clearly shows their face, while they are holding up a paper with their: reddit username, youtube username, /r/weightlifting, and the date. [example](http://i.imgur.com/owaesno.png), followed by them stepping on a scale and showing proof of their bodyweight. You may wear as little or as much clothing for this portion as you are comfortable with. If you do not clearly show your bodyweight with at least 1 visible decimal, you will be disqualified if the problem is not ratified by means of a second confirmation submission within the timeframe.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,1364137118.0,,Canada,True,t3_1a2cjs,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1a2cjs/rweightliftings_first_ever_ecompetition/,moderator

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwYbiZwbkuY

It consists of:

* Deadlift to mid/upper thigh

* Clean

* Front squat with a 3 second pause at the very bottom

* Push press

* Paused jerk (pause in the dip for the jerk for about 2 seconds)

Post the weight you got up to in the comments, and the percentage of your max that you used.


Hopefully this one is alright with everyone. Maybe we can take a vote here for what we want next week. Post some complexes in the comments and I can add them to a list.

Or if you guys don't want to vote for them next week. I could just choose one at random for each week. That could keep it interesting anyway. Just let me know what you want to do.

I hope to see some big numbers!

So far we got:

u/GrecoRomanStrength with a super nice set at 175lbs/80kg at 140lbs BW [seen here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1l3ykJ2nTVo&amp;feature=youtu.be)

u/Taunk  Hit 230lb/105kg at 240lb bodyweight. So that's a sinclair of 112.6.

u/humanlimbspool did it without the push press at 205lbs/~93kg

I was completely fried when I tried this. Did it with 185lbs easily, jumped to 225 too fast and failed the push press. Good news is, this was right after  I hit a 10lb PR (98kg/215lbs)on my snatch and just barely failed snatching 102kg/225lbs, and the day before  I PR'd my clean and jerk with 125kg up from 120kg. It has been a successful week for me so far!

I'm specifically interested in Americans who consider weightlifting to be their primary (preferably only) sport.

I'm sure many of you have been asked this question (by your mother who thinks you eat too much meat and eggs and are going to hurt yourself, or maybe after you were just finished explaining how weightlifting isn't the same thing as bodybuilding to your confused friend), and my usual answer is ""it's just something I'm really passionate about."" I've been trying to really look inwards at what makes that passion tick. When you think about it, we really do spend an absurd amount of time, effort, and pain on maxing out these two lifts.

Please share!

**Jan 9: Thanks everyone! I'm glad I got so many responses. It seems like the difficulty and multi-faceted (strength, power, speed, technique) nature of the challenge as well as competitiveness (with others and oneself) keeps us driven and in love with the sport.

[here](http://lifthard.com/more-info-about-china-and-the-chuanfu-squats/)

Also I see the Finnish lifters do this style of squat as well. I am wanting to improve my explosiveness out of the hole as opposed to pausing at the catch, which is my biggest issue right now.

Why does something feel heavier/lighter one day, compared to another? How much of it is CNS vs. Muscular? (I would think mostly CNS) Why does it seem, almost always, the CNS corresponds exactly to the force able to be produced? This may seem obvious, but why do things never actually feel very light, yet we can't lift it; or conversely, very heavy, yet we lift it quickly and smoothly. It's actually kind of amazing the CNS seems to be one point with how it feels. (usually)

Is there any deep analysis of what makes the weights we pick up feel heavy?

As before, totals used for calculating %WR are from national or international meets only. Recommendations for other stats you'd like to see are welcome, and I'll try and answer any questions I can if you'd like to get more in-depth.

My current plan is to start with athletes that hold American records. I expect to use active or questionably-active lifters only (at the least VERY recent lifters), so I don't plan to do people like Shane Hamman or Oscar Chaplin. Unless you all really want it for some reason..

* Include basic info about yourself here: Vitals, training schedule, training goals, past competition experience, your diet &amp; supplement (recovery, pills &amp; powders etc) regime can go here or in another section
* definitely include some points about your training style (Bulgarian? Chinese?). If you don't know, outline your program 
* ex: Heavy squatting with some medium % work in the 1-2 rep range for the snatch + CJ on mondays, front squats + light % work tuesday, heavy pressing + triples on wednesday, max out friday, go for squat RM and do partials (ie jerks, pulls, pauses, blocks) on saturdays

**Meet Prep**

* What did you do to taper your training (if you did) before the meet? How was your recovery and sleep the week leading up to the meet? did you have to cut weight? Anything surprise you a day or two before?

**The Lifts**

* Post a video if you have it, and outline your attempts 
* ex: I went 5/6, here's the video

**Snatch**

* xxxKG, make/miss: Outline what happened on your first attempt
* xxxKG, make/miss: Outline what happened on your second attempt
* xxxKG, make/miss: Outline what happened on your third attempt

**Clean and Jerk**

* xxxKG, make/miss: Outline what happened on your first attempt
* xxxKG, make/miss: Outline what happened on your second attempt
* xxxKG, make/miss: Outline what happened on your third attempt

**Results**

* how did you place, what was your total, what was your sinclair?
* any other special points (I set a PR, I beat a rival)

**Final thoughts**

* add in any other notes about future training, prep etc, as well as any knowledge you gained from the competition

* 186cm , 84.0kg, 17 Years Old
* Training 4-5x a week since January 2
* Train for olympic lifting primarily (I also do high-school only PL meets)
* Second WL Meet (2 PL meets under my belt as well)
* Paleo from January to about June, now I eat primarily Paleo with some additional carb sources (Oats, some bread, rice etc) edit: also whole milk
* Multivite, Vit D, Vit C daily, Optimum Platnium Pre before each workout
* I've been training so hard to try and get a 202kg total to qualify for Nationals  and I end up entering the competition with a 207kg training total, but couldn't get that on the platform.


**Meet Prep**

* The wednesday prior to this meet, the provinical WL assosication released a bulletin saying that there are 3 more male spots on the provincial team. There was already a 94kg going, so I had to cut down to 85 if I wanted to make it. Well, I weighed 91kg, so I knew I'd have to do some serious water loading.
* Thursday I drank 13-14L of water (I stopped counting after 12) and ate only lean protein. Friday I ate ~500g chicken thighs with Ms. Dash all up in those thighs, and drank no water
* Friday night I was 191 on my gym scale (slightly heavy) so I knew I was good
* I slept a total of 2-3hours and that really messed with my head
* After weighing in at 84kg, I drank about 1.5L of pedialyte and snacked on some mashed sweet potatoes and more chicken thighs. 
* was going to go balls out and open with a 91kg snatch and hope for a 111kg CJ to qualify (ie open with the lifts needed to qualify to get 3 chances, all or nothing sort of thing), but my openers didn't go super well, so that didn't happen.


**The Lifts**	

Went 3/6 on my lifts

Video Soon

**Snatch**

* 80kg - Miss, though looking back I rode it down too much
* 80kg - so relieved I got this
* 85kg - no lift

**Clean and Jerk**

* 102kg - I use ammonia in training sometimes, but I wasn't looking at the bottle and I put my nostril fully in and got some nasty ammonia in my nose, then when I went to clean it I got a massive headrush and cleaned the bar straight into my throat.
* 102kg
* 107kg 


**Results**

Walked out with a **187kg total** , putting me at a 224 sinclair. I am very proud that I was able to cut the weight in order to even compete (I went from 210 at peak to 185 when I weighed in, all on three days notice.)

**Records**

Broke no PRs or federation records
Competition PRs all around, gotta work on brining my training consistency to the platform, and to be more consistent in the snatches

**Final Thoughts**

* Happy I hit comp PRs, glad I made weight, good learning experience
* I need to work on getting a more consistent snatch
* Next WL meet is February 9

I don't know why, but I've become fascinated with the sport of weightlifting the past three months.  I'm not going to kid myself into thinking I'll probably ever be in a comp/meet, but I'd like to learn the lifts all the same.  I have quite a few issues to work through that are specific to that goal (I have serious issues in regards to flexibility/mobility), as well as chronic health problems (Type-1 Diabetic, been obese and the opposite of athletic/fit my entire life, hypothyroidism etc).

I'm hopeful that I can work towards being able to do the lifts, and that incorporating the kind of training olympic lifters use can give me some health benefits.  It's been keeping my attention a bit more than trying to do the things bodybuilders do anyways, which is probably why I'm so interested in sticking with it.  A major long term goal for me is to reach a healthier weight (BF%) and the fact that trying to teach myself how to do these more dynamic barbell movements has kept me regularly working out which I'm happy about.  The two hours I spend in the basement every other day has helped immensly in controlling my blood sugars!

To a specific point: I do have a ""form check"" video for a power clean (the only thing I seem to be able to do right now with any success) and I would be very grateful for any input, on the video or otherwise (what I should be doing, things I can do to help me develop the conditioning needed, or perhaps even a counter-argument that I should be doing something else).  Fair warning; I am not a pretty picture- I don't  have any of the appropriate equipment, and I can't get myself low for a pull from the floor.  I'm 6'2, currently about 135Kilos (298-300 lbs) and I believe the weight in the video is about 80Kilos (175lbs).  One thing I'd mention that you can't really see from the angle, is that I'm starting to have an excessively wide foot stance on the catch.  Not quite sure why it started.

I will mainly be working with crossfitters, some of which know what the snatch/clean and jerk are but rarely ever perform them while others have some experience with the lifts through crossfit but are not very proficient.

I was wondering if anybody can direct me to any weightlifting literature, resources, or general advice for effective coaching. I know it will be an ongoing work in progress but I am dedicated to hopefully getting some of these crossfitters to spend more time with our barbell club and becoming better weightlifters.

I'm having a lot of trouble with that right now. 

I train every day after class for about 2-2.5 hours. Sometimes I find myself at the gym for 3 hours if I spend time bull shitting with my lifting buddies. Come home and work on homework until I go to bed. This is my routine every day. Last week I took two days off from training to prepare for exams and I got so much more done. I felt like complete scum of the earth for skipping two days of training, but I felt pretty prepared going into the exams.  

Anyways I'm a bio major, junior in undergrad, and I plan on applying to PT school. My gpa is super low to be competitive in PT school (2.9). I'm really really hoping I can get it to at least a 3.0 before sending out applications. I don't want to make excuses but my training definitely does put a huge strain on my ability to pull good grades in school. I could never give up weightlifting, I love the sport way to damn much, despite the fact that all of my family and friends want me to train less to focus more on school. Anyways the point of this post is to ask two questions: 

1: Any full time students out there balance school and training? How do you do it?

2: Does weightlifting hold any value on a grad school application? By the time I apply to grad school I will have a USAW level 1 (Getting it in june) And I will have experience working part time as a coach at my gym (I'll be coaching intro classes). I will also hopefully had competed in 4-5 national level meets (Assuming I qualify for nationals this year my competition total is 4kg away).

What I want to know is:

* How good are you at doing the ""extra"" things? Examples: stretching every day, eating well, managing your aches and pains, doing prehab and core work, working on technique
* How consistent are you with your training? Example: your program says 5x/week; do you always get in every session, and do you always get in every set/rep of every exercise?

I know nobody's perfect. I am not perfect. Sometimes I think I assume too much of people, though, so I'd like to get a realistic picture of how well a snapshot of the community really does.

It will be held at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs on August 23rd and 24th, and will also incorporate a ""selection camp.""

Some of you may remember a topic some months ago about [the politics of weightlifting](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/16lkyr/the_politics_of_weightlifting_glenn_pendlay/), where Glenn Pendlay analyzed this particular policy which, as of yet, had never actually been used. You can look at it yourself in the [Athlete Handbook [PDF]](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCwQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.teamusa.org%2F~%2Fmedia%2FUSA_Weightlifting%2FDocuments%2F2013%2520Qualifying%2520Documents%2FAthlete%2520Handbook%2520and%2520Reference%2520Guide%2520for%25202013%2520International%2520Competition.pdf&amp;ei=HiPoUfiXGtLl4AOijIDYCA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF3OMF2FmSjBYKAX0m2W7wE_65IVA&amp;sig2=fPjViA0ZWV67CfdDBca6qA&amp;bvm=bv.49478099,d.dmg&amp;cad=rjt), the relevant sections being part of 10.4 and 10.5.

It's a little complicated, so I'll break it down. The World Team always consists of 8 males plus 2 alternates and 7 females plus 2 alternates. Lifters are ranked based on the percentage of their weight class's qualifying total (the average of the 3rd place total over the last five years), and ONLY lifters who are in the top two in their class are assigned an actual rank. This means that, for example, Ian Wilson is not ranked, because he did not beat Donovan Ford's or David Garcia's totals at 105, even though he would otherwise be #8 on the list. Neither is Colin Burns, who would be #9, and instead the 8th man is currently James Tatum with the top 77kg total.

This matters because the only people eligible to attend the OTC camp and Trials are the two alternates and anyone ranked ahead of them. The top 6 men and 5 women are considered to have a ""lock"" on their spots (the USAW post says 8 and 7, but it's wrong; the handbook is correct, plus 8 and 7 doesn't make any sense), so will not need to attend.

The current World Team rankings can be found [here](http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Weightlifting/Features/2013/July/17/Colorado-Springs-to-Host-World-Team-Trials), but here they are also in handy-dandy reddit formatting:

Two more competitions remain to determine the Trials-eligible athletes: Senior Nationals, and Junior Pan Ams, both in less than two weeks. If it were held today, however, David Garcia and James Tatum would have the option of defending their spots against Ian Wilson, Kevin Cornell, Cameron Swart, Spencer Moorman, and Darrel Barnes (Burns is left out because Cooper and Nackoul are already locked in at 85, same with 94, although I don't know if that's allowable anyway). Kelly Rexroad Williams and Vanessa McCoy would similarly have the option of defending against Breanne Bassler Havard and Ellen Kercher.

Got it? If not, I don't blame you - it took awhile for me to be sure I grasped the concept.

I was requested to write this in part because there's some hubbub going on since the announcement yesterday - there are some very negative responses from coaches on the news post linked at the top, which has since been removed from the front page for ""updates"" (the link still works). Some people are unhappy about the short notice, less than six weeks in advance, others are unhappy about the OTC Trials concept itself, and still others don't like the idea of there being so many competitions so close to Worlds.

I will attempt not to editorialize, though much of the following is hearsay and subjective. USAW has had communication problems for a long time, where people feel the [Board of Directors](http://www.teamusa.org/USA-Weightlifting/About-Us/Governance/Board-of-Directors) hands down its decisions from on high, often at the last minute. Members of the Board have said there is an open process where people are aware of what's happening and have input well in advance. I'm not here to tell you who is right. The Athlete Handbook does claim there was a comment period from January 1st to 8th for this year's rules and procedures, and it's true comments can be made anytime.

I'll be happy to answer any questions I can. Politics is not my game, however, so I am a bit limited on that score.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,United-States,True,t3_1iko32,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1iko32/final_us_world_team_trials_date_announced/,

Been trying to train the olympic movements for the past 6 months consistently. Don't really have access to a coach until Saturdays. I lift in a commercial gym monday-friday at 5am. Saturdays i train in a crossfit gym at 7a. Been following this schedule for the past 4 months. This was my first competition. I take whey protein, fish oil and a multivitamin.

Been following the Waxman WOD program. I find it to be really helpful, although it really wish it included some heavy squatting (front or back) days. He never seemed to go over 80%, which for me is not particularly heavy when my max back squat is 335 and my max front squat is 295. Saturdays i would spend alot of time using jerk blocks to do heavy pulls and jerks. Since I cant drop the weight in my commercial gym, i use Saturdays as my ""max out"" so to speak, to really take it up.

**Meet Prep**

I kept my schedule pretty consistent. The week before, i tapered. I only trained on M-W-F, and each day I took my warmups to what i hoped to open with and called it a day. Felt fresh the day of the meet.

**The Lifts**

I will post more videos, but here is on my final c&amp;j of 112kg, which i received 3 reds. I think i dropped it before the signal.

http://www.coachseye.com/5ebo

I ended up the day with a 5/6. Very pleased with it


**Snatch**

* 75KG, make: bar moved smoothly. i opened up lighter than i hoped (originally 79kg), but my warmups were skewed. it was a long day of standing around so i felt really cold and not great. 75kg felt good.
* 79KG, make: Felt good, and tight. No issues
* 82KG, make: Felt good, and tight. No issues. Not the 90 that I hoped, but i cant complain.

**Clean and Jerk**

* 103KG, make: Felt great. Warmed up real nice and hit the platform for an easy opener.
* 108KG, make: Felt great. Little hop on the recovery, but still locked it out overhead.
* 112KG, miss: I wanted 115 but a few trainers there thought it was risky to make a 7kg jump. So i went with 112 which i hit pretty consistently. I originally wanted to do 103/112/120, but i am now learning those a huge jumps. As you can see in the video above, i think i either didnt lockout, or dropped it before the signal. I am not sure. The clean was easy. Deff had more in me.


**Final thoughts**

Overall, i had a great time. It was  LONG day. I got to the facility for 11am weigh in expecting to lift at 1:30, but didnt get to the platform until 5:15. It was a good experience. I met GrecoRoman there. Cool dude.

All in all, I am looking forward to my next meet. I now have an official score and benchmarks so i look forward to hitting some hard training in the coming months until my next meet.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,1364215915.0,,United-States,True,t3_1ays4j,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1ays4j/meet_report_2013_nyc_open_mens_and_womens/,

Much Thanks


*Edit* - Thanks for all the good responses.  Looks like I have been on the low side of my omega 3 intake (around 2 grams per day).

(Sorry no video),hosemonkey,18,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/17w7s6/meet_report_2013_colorado_state_and_open/,"This was my first USAW meet.  I weighed in at 91.1 two hours before the competition.  Because it was my first I didn't want to worry about gaining or cutting weight in the time leading up to the event so I just competed in the most comfortable weight class for me (94).  

Snatch:

* Attempt 1: 100.  Made it comfortably.
* Attempt 2: 105.  Made it very comfortably.  Actually was technically a power snatch.  
* Attempt 3: 110.  Missed.  I originally planned on 108 but my coach and I agreed that I was feeling strong enough for the 110.  This would tie a training pr.  I didn't quite finish my 2nd pull and it put the bar in front enough that I couldn't save it.  But I was happy with the 105.

Clean and Jerk

* Attempt 1: 131. Miss due to equipment malfunction.  I popped the Velcro on my Valeo belt and it hit the floor.  I guess that counted as a part of me touching the platform so no lift.  I also moved up to 131 from 130 because of a mis-timed warm up lift as I was supposed to go out to the platform (2 lifters in front of me jumped up in weight too without me realizing.)  So the extra kilo bought me another 3 minutes which was perfect.
* attempt 2: 131, made it.  Went as smooth as could be.
* attempt 3: 136, made it.  This was only 3 under a training pr so I was happy to finish with that. 

241 total.  Surprisingly this was good enough for a podium spot at 3rd place out of about 13 lifters.  I was pretty excited about that and my 2 year old daughter loves the medal they gave me.  


Lessons learned:  
* Having a coach/manager to tell you when and how much to warm up with was awesome.  Definitely not something I want to worry about on my own.
* CHECK YOUR EQUIPMENT - I feel like I had 140 in me for the C&amp;J, but the initial miss made me play it safe.

There seem to be two schools of thought on this. 

One advocates catching as high as possible during the full snatch/clean, then riding the weight down. As you increase weight during the workout, you catch lower and lower. I've seen great lifters who seem to follow this logic. 

The other methodology advocates pulling only high enough so that you can get under the bar, regardless of weight. I see this very often in the modern Russian training videos. With 50kg or 150kg, doesn't matter... they are pulling only as high as necessary to get under the bar. 

Personally, I like to practice maximum extension when doing power lifts. Extend as hard as I can then catch as high as I can. However, when doing the full lifts I pull only as high as necessary. This can be hard to do with lighter weights, but if I do all my warm-up weights catching high and riding down I have a really hard time transitioning into a low catch position. I keep trying to catch everything high.

Anyway, I just thought this topic might warrant it's own thread. What do you think?",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_11j24c,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/11j24c/catching_high_and_riding_down_vs_catching_low/,

* 5’9″ – 89.6kg – 26 years old.  Didn’t do any kind of cutting whatsoever.
* 1st weightlifting meet after 2 months of Oly training, along with 2 years of powerlifting.
* Supplements:  Vitamin D (5000IU), Fish Oil (4g DMA/EHA mix), ZMA, Melatonin (3g), Creatine (5g)

Started to pick up weightlifting right after my last powerlifting meet (in March 2013).  My plan was to ease into the sport and try to keep a 50/50 balance between powerlifting and weightlifting, but I found quickly that trying to mix both was just not working.  I didn’t have plans to compete so early, but since this meet was right at my local gym, there was no reason not to.

The majority of my training went on a 4 day a week schedule, with a light/heavy snatch day, and a light/heavy C&amp;J day.  Outlined below:

Sunday

* Heavy Snatch (go for PR, best was 94kg)
* High bar squat 3 x 5

Monday

* Light C&amp;J (usually worked up to around 100kg for a lot of singles)
* Front Squat 3 x 3

Tuesday

* Light Snatch (worked up to around 70 kg)
* High bar squat 3 x 5

Thursday

* Heavy C&amp;J (best PR was 120kg)
* Front squat 3 x 3

**Meet Prep**

No real issues in terms of meet prep.  For tapering, I just dropped the volume and weight of my lifting.  In particular, I had a funny thing with snatches… it was as if I had forgotten how to snatch completely (it shows a bit in the video).  Before tapering, my gym PRs were 94kg snatch and 120kg clean and jerk.  I remember hitting 70kg snatches perfectly weeks before tapering, but then having trouble hitting 70kg in my taper.  Can’t really point as to why this would be, but I am sure it’ll uncover itself in the future.

In two years of powerlifting, I was never quite as sore and beat up as I’ve been in my weightlifting experience.  Especially in my shoulders and wrists.

**The Lifts**

[VIDEO](http://youtu.be/34vaxExpNEI)

Went 3/6.  Extra thanks to my sister for taking video!  My camera for whatever reason did not work, so I would have had no video.

**Snatch**

* 85KG, miss:  For what would become a problem for the rest of the meet, I didn’t drop my hips low enough, and the bar kept moving forward on the pull.  Some nerves.  Overall, snatches just did not feel right.
* 85KG, make:  Power snatch.  I played this one safe to make sure I would get it and not bomb out.
* 90kg, miss:  Same issue as the first snatch.  Just blanked out.

**Clean and Jerk**

* 110KG, make:  Felt good, but after watching the video, should have dropped my hips a bit more.
* 115KG, miss:  This felt and seemed good to me, but it was called on a press out.
*  115KG, make:  I had planned for a 121kg third attempt, but wanted to go for the better total, so stuck with 115kg.  Went up fine.

**Results**

Ended with a total of 200 kg (441 lb) at 89.6 kg, and a Sinclair of 233.05. I took 3rd place in the 94kg Senior class.

**Final Thoughts**

* Not the way I wanted to start my weightlifting career.  Mostly came from having nerves and just not getting the right mindset the week before.  I know I mostly need more experience, but my results were not what I wanted.
* Great to see some of the high-level lifters at this meet.  In particular, watching Colin Burns in my weight class was an eye opener.
* This was the first time I had really watched video of myself in my lifting.  I noticed some errors I would have caught before if I had been watching more video, so I’m going to be taping myself more often.
* Got a lot to work on, overall, but a lot of room to improve.
* I don’t have a meet planned out now, and the only thing I have going on is a powerlifting meet coming up in November.  Chances are, I will have one or two more weightlifting meets before that happens.  Until then, I’m going to put the majority of my training in weightlifting, and give myself one day a week for some of the powerlifting movements.  If I get another weightlifting meet scheduled this year, I’ll drop the powerlifting work.

My training plan for the future is as follows:

Sunday

* Heavy C&amp;J
* Front Squat (3×3)

Monday

* Light Snatch (20 minutes/10 reps)
* Squat (3×5)
* Snatch Balance (3×5)

Tuesday

* Light C&amp;J (20 minutes/10 reps)
* Front Squat (3×3)
* Jerks (triples)

Thursday

* Heavy Snatch
* Squat (3×5)

Friday

* Light Snatch
* Bench (3 x 5)
* Deadlift (1 x 5)",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,1369140384.0,,,True,t3_1epa24,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1epa24/meet_report_michigan_weightlifting_championships/,

1375108193.0,10,self.weightlifting,1ja00m,[First Meet Report] 2013 Virginia State Championships &amp; Open - 96/117/213 @ 81 Senior,whitmell,14,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1ja00m/first_meet_report_2013_virginia_state/,"**Background and Training**


33 years old, started olympic lifts last Sept, just doing them for fun, got bit by the bug, have been training pretty hard in parking lots on my lunch break w/ my own equipment.  Found out about this meet earlier this month and decided to do it just for the experience.

**Meet Prep**

I spent June doing the 6-week ""russian squat program"" you see all over the internet and afterwards was focusing on strength in the lifts, doing a lot of complexes and pulls.  When I found out about the meet about 2 1/2 weeks out I switched to [Jon North's program](http://www.theattitudenation.com/#!copy-of-an-weightlifting/cnej) because he was tapering for nationals, the same weekend as my meet.  I decided it would be a good idea to try and lift on a platform once so I called around and a local weightlifting coach let me come into his gym and lift on a platform while he watched &amp; critiqued for an hour.  That was a good experience and confidence booster, ended up hitting a [PR 100kg snatch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJTJI6Jz7Uo) 2 days later, a week before the meet. 

1 week out I was feeling really strong and definitely felt capable of at least 100 on snatch and 120+ on CJ.

Unfortunately my low back &amp; pelvis started really bothering me that weekend, I think from overtraining (read: underrecovery).  On Wednesday, my last heavy session before the meet, I tweaked my back really bad doing my snatch opener of 90kg.  I spent the next 2 days resting and trying my best to rehab my back.

**The Meet**

Don't remember my exact weight but it was about 81kg.

Found a guy warming up who was opening about the same as me and he had 6 or 7 meets under his belt so I kind of followed his lead on warmups, that was a big help.  Back was bothering me on the warmup lifts so I foam rolled and stretched a lot between every lift.  Thought about lowering my opener last minute but just decided to go for it.

Ended up going 4/6 and making a CJ PR and ended up with 3rd place.  Pretty happy about that for my first meet!
Here's the full video of all 6 lifts:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLKS5PgesnY

**Snatch:**

* 90kg: make - nerves were going nuts but the bar went up relatively easy, but when I caught it, it felt like a million pounds.  Managed to keep it locked though but it was soft.  
* 96kg: make - I honestly don't remember a single thing about this lift, it happened so fast.  Sucks they didn't change the board after the 95kg before me so it looks like I was only doing 95.
* 101kg: miss - would have been a 1kg PR, but somehow my brain just shut off mid-lift.  This is my one regret from the meet, I wish I'd just tried to go under this, because my position at the knees is still good enough to have at least attempted the lift.  Oh well.
	
	
**Clean &amp; Jerk**

* 110kg: make - Pretty straightforward lift
* 117kg: make - Forgot to bring my feet in before the jerk, something I was working on the week before.  Really sloppy jerk but they gave it to me, and it was a PR!
* 121kg: miss - Did not have the legs to stand up with this one.  I think I was just shot at this point, but I'm weak on front squat anyway.
	
**Lessons learned**

Had a great time!  I wish my back was at 100% but who knows if it would have made much of a difference; my meet total was only 2.5kg less than my training total so I'm pretty happy overall.  There are a couple places where I know it made a difference: the first being that I changed my whole setup (taking time to brace my trunk carefully for my back's sake) and starting stance to a more toes forward stance to support my hips better based on reading Kelly Starrett's book before the meet (which I feel actually helped), the second being that I didn't quite get full extension in my lifts because that was the part of the lift that hurt my back the most, so I was cutting my extension short a bit.  It didn't make much of a difference but if I had gone for that 101 snatch I would have really had to extend to get that one up.


My brain thought it was done after the snatch portion.  It was tough to get amped up to go again.  I'm used lifting all in about an hour on my lunch break, I've never taken a break between snatch and clean &amp; jerk before.  Next time I will practice that.


I lost 2nd place by 1kg, and considering how light I was I probably had a good chance of beating him on bodyweight if we had tied.  I don't know if he was paying attention and intentionally went 1 kilo over, if so, good for him.  I didn't go in with any plans for strategy, just to make my lifts, so I can't complain.  But I'll know for next time to pay attention to the cards.  It was just hard to follow since all the weight classes were in the same session.


This was the first time I've ever lifted around anyone else, and it was interesting to see other guys lifting big weights in person.  I've only ever seen the olympic lifts on video so it was good to see how strong and explosive some of these guys are because it puts it in perspecive just how much better I have to get.  First place in my weight class beat me by almost 30 kilos!  Most of the guys opening at 110 in the clean and jerk were basically power cleaning it, I had to hit rock bottom just to get under it.  I know strength is my biggest weakness but I didn't realize just how strong some of these guys are.  I've got some work to do!

1374787123.0,14,self.weightlifting,1j1yvf,Smolov Jr. Front Squat Review,c4lmlikeab0mb,18,4,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1j1yvf/smolov_jr_front_squat_review/,"After seeing [ephrion's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1gshjj/program_review_smolov_jr_for_front_squats/) about this here, I decided I'd give it a go, too. 

Before I started:

I was just experimenting for fun, with a 20 rep squat program. I had to stop because it was killing my knees, and I'm sure my max BS and FS were nowhere near my actual best after I stopped this. My squats felt horrible, I took about a week off squatting then started this.

My max front squat was 335lbs, I used 330 for the program. I was still burnt out from all the 20 rep squats for 2 weeks, and a week of maxing out on power clean and jerks. I finished the whole program but it was 3 weeks of pure hell. There were a couple of times where  I did some extra things (no squats) and regretted it very much.

Had to push myself to 110% pretty much every day. Started wrapping my knees going into the 2nd week. My squats started getting to be less of a ROM, and slow (normally I drop down all the way pretty quickly). Legs never really got sore at all, but my upper back was taking a beating.

When I finished I took 4 days completely off, Friday and Saturday I made attempts at 365 and 350, but I only managed to get my old max of 335 and even that felt crappy. I probably didn't rest enough. My core felt really strong though, my legs just couldn't push through. 

This week I've been going to a daily max backsquat. They feel more or less the same as before I started doing the 20 rep squats. They're also starting to help my knees feel better. My best squat is 380, 2 days ago I did 335, it was a bit slow. Today I front squatted 340 for a 5lb PR, in the morning on an empty stomach. That felt pretty good, I failed 365 shortly after. Didn't expect to get it, just wanted to see how it felt. 

So I guess my max front squat is around the same as my back squat right now. The 340lb front squat felt about the same as the 335lb back squat. 

I'll see how things turn out over the next couple of weeks.

1365382159.0,12,self.weightlifting,1bvxbz,"[Meet Report] University Nationals, Johnson City, Tennessee 62kg A 4/6/2013",GrecoRomanStrength,12,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1bvxbz/meet_report_university_nationals_johnson_city/,"**Background**

With almost a year of training since my first competition, I was very excited to be at my first National Championship. My training schedule has moved up to 6 days a week, Mon-Sat. MonWedFriSat I usually do the lifts or some assistance work, TueThurSat are my pulls and squats days. I train in New York, on Long Island in Garden City. 

**Meet Prep**

Two Weeks before this meet, the place I train at had a competition so I went in that. I didn't cut(went 69kg, at 63.5kg), and just acted like another training day, and hit 85/110 there. Not great, not bad. 
My tapering was simple, the Monday before the meet (meet was a Saturday) I went a little heavy, [80kgx2]x3 in the Snatch, 100kgx3 in the CJ. Tuesday was off, Wednesday was light, 70/90, Thursday spent driving down, Friday was 75/95. 

My recovery and sleep was good. My weigh in was at 6am for that Saturday, so the week before I was getting up at 5:45am to get my body ready to respond early. To cut weight I just ate less. I managed to get down to 134.75lbs, 61.25kg, normally I sit at 142~. I felt no loss of strength or anything, just a bit hungry. 

**The Meet**

The Friday before the meet I did some lifts. They felt good. Not amazing, but good. I felt ready and excited to lift. 

After a successful weigh-in, I went to my hotel, ate, drank water, foam rolled a bit, then went back to the venue. 

I start warming up, and things feel good and quick. I am set to open my Snatch at 85kg. My first warm up at 80kg, I miss in front. I take it again right away, and make it, but much too difficult. After a moment, I decide to take 80kg once more. I miss it aggressively behind. Right after that miss behind, I have to take my first Snatch at a National Meet...

**Snatch**

1.  [85kg Successful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=21m27s) Even though I just missed something easy, I stayed relaxed on my first attempt. I did not feel any nerves in particular. I took this Snatch like a routine 85, and made it. 

2. [90 kg Unsuccessful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=26m30s) I made 90 a lot in training. I should have had this, I just didn't get that pull right I suppose. 

3. [90kg Succesful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=28m44s) This one was close. I was lucky they didn't red light it, and even luckier I didn't outright lose it. 

Snatches should have been better. But I'd take it. The 90kg put me in 2nd place.

**Clean and Jerk**
Warming up again was good. I've made 115kg in training, but set my opener at 105kg, just to be safe....good thing I did, because warming up, before I'm about to go out, I missed my 100kg jerk.

[105kg Successful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=1h14m2s) Easy clean, decent jerk. 

[110kg Successful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=1h18m) Jerk a little unstable, but good lift nonetheless.

[115kg Unsuccessful Lift](http://youtu.be/vamxrSSO0xs?t=1h25m59s) Argh!!! I hate missing jerks with such easy cleans. I can usually clean very easy, my jerks keep holding me back. I would have liked to have made this, but oh well. I had 90/110. 

**Results**

Jeffery Walters made a very close attempt at a 117 CJ, but his miss allowed me 2nd place, at a 200 total. Not my absolute best lifting, but 2nd place at my first National meet was very thrilling!!! 

**Final Thoughts**

I can and will get better. Right after these lifts, I front squatted 125kg for an easy triple. But this was extremely fun, and I really enjoyed everything. I'm looking forward to my next National meet!! ",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1bvxbz,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1bvxbz/meet_report_university_nationals_johnson_city/,

I met all my goals, which was tough, especially the sleep part since I have a few very early mornings. The bodyweight thing was a little hit or miss because my scale was being finicky, but I *think* I succeeded. For this week I'm going to up the game a little bit by going for a full 8 hours of sleep every night and continuing the rest, plus a new, lower bodyweight goal given that I have to actually make weight at Americans. Why must they always schedule Thanksgiving right before the AO? :-P

I attribute most of this success to just being calm about the lift. No jumping up the bar, un-racking it quickly with excitement or anything. 

Instead, I calmly approached it, un-racked it, and easily PR'd. I noticed my weights had oscillated more than usual too.  

I found it quite an amazing different in being relaxed. I felt the front squat a lot more in the legs, less in the back. 

It's very different than say, a power-lifter, yelling and screaming. But they require a lot more tension for their slower lifts. 

Anyone else have anything else to add about being relaxed while lifting during weightlifting?

A few friends and I have been slowly building a gym in my house and it's expanded into a shady warehouse now! I made a previous post about my basement here so this is almost a repost.

We call the gym Cambridge Strength and Conditioning. It's ~1mile from alewife T-station and rt 2 so it's pretty convenient to drive and or bike here. We also have plenty of parking at the warehouse (pictures/videos/directions) are on facebook below.

**Schedule:** We currently work out Mon, Wed, Fri, Sat and start at 6PM except Sat which is usually 10AM -1PM. Some of us are doing Texas Method and others are doing SS/misc. Our group is generally comprised of being just interested in strength training or ultimate frisbee/rugby players looking for weight training.

Two of us have been to the SS seminar and have also done the USA Weightlifting level one certification. We have goals of doing a raw powerlifting event at the end of July and a weightlifting event at a later time

**Equipment:** We have 2 squat racks, power rack, 2 solid benches, 2000+ pounds of iron, two olympic platforms (8x4 and 8x8), pendlay , york, B&amp;R, misc barbells, ~400 pounds of bumper plates, pull up bar station, concept 2 rower, prowler, chalk stands, stereo with epic music, water (yes water!), and coffee.

Here's a web site we just put up cambridgestrength.com but we mostly use facebook.

http://www.facebook.com/CambridgeStrengthAndConditioning

We aren't looking to make money, just to expand our group, get some more dedicated like minded lifters, and get the rent paid. Also we have one female that trains with us every session and another 3 that drop in from time to time.

If you are interested in just visiting, Fridays are PR days and we go out for food and drinks after. Saturdays we will be grilling at the gym.

**update**

Thanks for the redditors who showed up! We had a lot of fun sweating!

Backpain, hip flexor pain, minor knee pain and also some small hip pains.

I know very well where these problems are coming from. It's because I've been trying to perform really deep squats without having the proper flexibility to perform one. 

What I actually wanted to bring up is if tall people can have a good squat, what I mean by that is, squatting with a very upright back. Let me give you an idea of my flexbility, I can't do a pistol squat at all and the thing is that I don't if its my body dimension/mechanics that doesn't allow it or if I'm really inflexible. I have a friend who's shorter than me and he can perform pistol squats and he hasn't even been in a gym and he probably hasn't stretched in the last 5 years.

Basically I'm wondering if its possible to achieve these really upright squats we see oly lifters do as a taller person. Has anyone dealt with the same problem? Bear in mind I've only been doing weightlifiting for about three months or more.  

Right now I'm only doing front squats because they allow my back to stay injury free. Although right now I'm dealing with hip flexor pain because of wide stance. Thing is, if I try a narrower stance I can squat without hip flexor pain but then I'm not as upright anymore and I'm afraid my back will take the hit again.

Overview was I went 5/6 and finished with a 10kg total pr.  

**Training**

Very straightforward.  3 days a week.  

* Day 1: Snatch, Jerk, Squats, snatch pulls

* Day 2: Clean, push press, squats, clean pulls

* Day 3: Snatch, C&amp;J, Front Squats

I am also a dirty dirty crossfitter so I do several conditioning type wods during the week around my lifting.  Usually between 3-4 ""wods"" on top of weightlifting. 

The cycle was pretty straight forward as well.  3 months out was lots of volume as heavy as I could stand (think sets of 8).  2 months out slightly lower volume with lightly more weight (sets of 5). 1 months out everything went to sets of 3 but higher weight again.  Followed a pretty basic super-compensation structure from week to week.  (80%, 90%, 85%, 95-100%).

Two weeks out I was horribly sick and  I was pretty discouraged because I figure I had wasted all my hard training by missing my last heavy week in the cycle. That was pretty silly thinking my me.  At the advice of /u/olympic_lifter the meet is a culmination of all training, not just what you can do in the last 2 weeks.  

1 week out I still used as a taper week.  only 3 workouts the whole week, never going past my opener.  I didn't have to cut weight.  I came in 1 kilo shy at the weigh ins. 

**the lifts**


Snatch: 

* 102 - Miss - Got a little jumpy on the first lift.  tried to pull way to fast off the ground and just had sloppy form.  

* 102 - Make - Calmed down and hit this very easily

* 107 (meet pr) - Make - Same very easy make for me.  Although it was a meet pr, I left a lot of weight on the bar.  But that is what I get for missing my opener.  

Clean &amp; Jerk:

* 134 - Make - definitely a big opener for me but I felt great warming up and made the lift easily on the platform.

* 139 - Make - I thought I pressed out on the top but the judges let me have it with 3 whites.  Thanks.

* 144 - Make - All time pr! previous was 143 in practice.  Previous meet pr was 136.  Very excited about this one.  

* 251 total was good enough for 1st place in the 94's and a 10 kg total meet pr for me.  


**lessons learned**

* Calm the f*ck down. - despite being sick and missing a full week, I couldn't have asked for a much better performance.  Also if I was a little calmer before my 1st lift I probably could have gone 6/6 that day.  

Had a great time.  Many of my compadres had a great meet as well.  I can't wait to do it all again.

Don't get discouraged In your lifting there is a FIX for everything it may take weeks, months, or even a year In some cases.

Here's the link: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxfTEkaDmok](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxfTEkaDmok)

China is the subject of much discussion, as the most dominant weightlifting power in the world at the moment, and I think we might get a clearer picture of what's going on if we look at a greater selection of their lifters. The biggest thing of note: the first guy in the session opened with 5.5kg over the American record (158). Now, our 62kg records are behind that of other classes, most likely because we don't have as many people that small in this country, but for comparison that would be similar to opening at more than 180kg in the 77s or well over 200kg at 94kg. That's a minimum A session total of over 300kg. At 62kg.

To be fair, China's lifters seem to center more on the lighter side, whereas Americans probably end up in the 85kg category more than any other, and their 77A session started with 175kg and 85A started with 180kg, both comparatively weaker. But to get an idea of just how good their 62s are, if Kendrick had been a 62kg lifter he'd be lucky to be able to qualify for China's A session. Chad Vaughn might have made it in his heyday, but probably not.

Another thing: for all the guys like Lu Xiaojun and Zhang Jie who can always easily front squat their cleans, the vast majority of the lifters had much more trouble. There does not appear to be any indication that Chinese lifters have better front squat to clean ratios than Americans.

Last, there were an awful lot of split jerks - too many to consider that as China's specific national methodology. Even the winner, Zhang Jie, was split jerking. I didn't quite count, but if split jerks weren't the majority, they were at least a plurality (there were power jerks, too). I would be curious to see an analysis of the percentage of made split jerks vs percentage of made squat jerks.

Remember, China claims to have 17 million in its weightlifting program. The U.S. has around nine thousand, behind by a factor of almost *two thousand*. There's no way China has taken all of these athletes away from their families and stuck them in special weightlifting programs, steroids alone could never make up this difference, and there's no magic bullet for training. Participation, more than anything else, is the difference between us.

Thoughts?

",,12,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/14g3ck/my_review_of_weightlifting_programming_a_winning/,"I just finished reading Mr. Takano's new book on programming, and thought I would submit a review to spur discussion in our subreddit. 

If you're familiar with Takano's theories or programming at all, you know he's a fan of Russian style programming, and some of his stuff can be a bit ""high-brow"", meaning lots of complicated programs, prescribed volumes and intensities, etc. 

The book starts with a basic review of biology, chemistry, adaptation to training, etc. Being a biology/chemistry geek, much of this wasn't particularly new or interesting to me, but I think it's a good review and probably needs included in the book. If these ideas are new to you, you will probably find it quite helpful, as it does establish a theoretical basis for much of the programming to follow. 

Mr. Takano is a big believer in Russian programming, specifically Medvedyev. He continues to categorize lifters by Class III, Class II, Class I, Candidate for Master, etc... He includes training rational and sample programming for each class of trainee. This is far more detailed than anything posted on his website. 

For example, in Class III training, he covers the theory behind the training, recommend exercises, volume and intensity, long-term planning, etc. He also provides a sample 4-week loading program and 4-week pre-competition program. I found this training to very closely follow the Medvedyev programming. But if you've ever read the Medvedyev stuff, you know it can sometimes read like stereo instructions. It is not well organized. Mr. Takano is very good at taking this information and laying it out in understandable and applicable ideas and programs. 

After going through each class of lifter specifically, Mr. Takano ends the book with discussion of restoratives, diet, and some coaching guidance and tips. The discussion on restoratives focuses on non-pharmacological therapies like massage, jacuzzi, contrast showers, etc. I found this section helpful, but would have preferred a more evidence-based discussion. For example, why exactly is a pine needle bath going to help me? Has this been studied, or am I just going to smell like pine all day and still be sore?

Overall, I'd say it's an excellent book. While I don't say one method of programming is absolutely superior over another, I tend to think the Russian/Chinese method of programming has produced a greater number of champions in the modern drug-tested era. And from what I have seen, there also does seem to be a reduced incidence of major injury with Russian programming. Regardless, the book is quite informative, and I would recommend it if you're at all interested in weightlifting programming.

Holy crap these are hard!  I've come to realize, after doing them a few times as warm ups, I desperately need more hip, ankle and shoulder flexibility (in addition to core strength).

Basically, for btn snatch grip, I can't lift the bar in a straight line.  Nor can I stay in a full squat.  And half the time, I hit the back of my head when lowering the bar. 

For clean grip, the bar almost goes friggin' diagonal in front of me, then I pull it laterally to the correct position once the bar is completely up.

Other than time and just doing them, does anyone have any tips/tricks, canon on proper form, etc that can help?

My weakest lift is Jerk.  It really frustrates me that my weakest lift is technically easier than Snatch and Clean.  I'm of the the belief that if you make your Clean easy you should be able to nail your Jerk.  Not with me, though.

I always struggle with the speed aspect of the lift.  In order to get vertical drive on the bar I can sometimes be too slow pushing my front leg forward enough thus leaving my back leg too straight which in turn pushes me hips behind the bar.  To compensate I can sometimes dive too quickly under the bar without putting enough into the drive phase.
  
I also have problems staying on my heels for the drive phase - I think about this too much and need it to be more automatic.

OK, so that's not so impressive, but it's a 35lb PR for me.",jcdyer3,10,0,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/glglq/100_lb_snatch_ok_so_thats_not_so_impressive_but/,"I'm a newbie to olympic-style lifts, and I've been loving working on cleans, but snatch has been tough so far.  (I did my first lifts in January, and get to work on them about once a week).  I've gotten my clean up to 155 lbs, but until recently, I've just been snatching the bar, and mostly working from a hang position.  I did some power snatches at 75 lbs, but never with a full squat.  This weekend, I decided I was ready to start putting some weight on, and going from the floor, so I set up 65 lbs.  Got two reps, but my landing in the squat was off balance, so it took a lot of core effort to stand it back up, and on the second one, I felt something tweak in my left elbow, so I unloaded the bar, did some mobility work, and went home.  

Today, my workout started with ""establish a heavy 2 rep snatch.""  I started with some hang snatch work with the bar, and then put 10lb bumpers on a 33lb bar, so I could work the full ROM at a lower warm-up weight.  I did five reps at 53, so I put the bumpers back on the 45lb bar, and did 3 reps at 65 lbs.  Still felt a little off balance at the top, but not too bad, so I upped the weight to 70 lbs.  Nailed my squat, and stood it back up with ease.  For the first time, the snatch felt like a smooth, fluent movement.  For the first time, it was a really fun way to put up weight.  

80 lbs also felt good for two reps, but my coach told me I needed to start the weight closer to my ankles, because I was still bouncing it out a little too far.  With 90lbs on the bar, I tried that, and it flew up even more smoothly.  I was going to call it a day, but the lure of putting 25lb bumpers on the bar called me to try another set.  I loaded up 95 lbs, and figured there would be no harm in another 5 lbs, to get into three digit weights.  

I stepped up to the bar, got it good and close to my ankles, locked down my back, and pulled the weight up.  Didn't feel quite as smooth, but it came up, I got under the bar, and hit a solid snatch.  On the second rep, I didn't get it fully overhead, but close enough that I could stand it up, and step forward under it at the end to lock it out.

Two solid reps at 100 lbs, having never gone above 65 lbs before.  Felt thoroughly awesome.

On the jerk, however, I have some issues. At weights I know I can push press, I'm not worried about locking out the bar, so I take the time I need to get to a nice deep split. As the weights get heavier, I get more worried that the bar is going to be coming right back down on me, so I rush the split, don't split as deep, and fulfill my own prophesy.

How does your split depth change with the weight on the bar? Do you split deeper as the weight gets heavier, do you always split the same distance, or do you have my problem? If you do split deeper as the weight gets heavier, how do you adjust? Do you know how deep you're going to split before you start the jerk? If you fuck up the dip'n'drive, can you, on the fly, split deeper to save it?

Thanks! Any other thoughts on jerking big weights are appreciated :D",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1jpdrr,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1jpdrr/how_does_your_jerk_split_depth_change_with_the/,

1371818522.0,10,self.weightlifting,1gshjj,[Program Review] Smolov Jr for Front Squats,ephrion,10,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1gshjj/program_review_smolov_jr_for_front_squats/,"I initially posted this as a link to my blog, but I guess it got caught in the spam filter.  Self-posts are fine.

**Initial Information:**

Before starting this, I had injured my wrist and wasn't able to do pretty much anything without hurting it.  Front squats were one of the only exercises I could do, so I decided to do a program that focused on a single exercise while I let my wrist heal.  My previous PR was 255lbs on the front squat, but I had done a lot of training for powerlifting and hadn't tested my max.  I calculated my weights using 245 max, as I tend to find that I can lift more than my rep maxes would indicate.

**More stats:**

5'10""/M/195lbs

Front Squat: 255lbs (Jan 11th, with a belt)

Low bar squat: 352lbs (at a meet on April 20th)

High bar squat: 295lbs (tested on April 30th, with a belt)

Deadlift: 402lbs (at a meet, April 20th)

**Thoughts During The Program:**

When I made the spreadsheet and initially looked at the program, I wasn't sure I'd be able to finish it out, even with lowballing my max.  There were several instances where I didn't think I'd be able to finish the day's work, but in every instance, I was able to finish the sets.  It was pretty damn hard.

I added 10lbs for the second week, and another 10lbs for the third week.  I did some accessory work as my wrist would permit; details of that are in my log.  I finished most of this without a belt, only using it on the first week as I felt some back irritation.

I did more mobility and flexibility work than usual, but still not as much as I probably should have.  At the end of week 3, my knees definitely felt achy, but were fine the day after.

**Diet:**

I did intermittent fasting.  Coffee, fish oil, and yohimbine for breakfast.  oats, peanut butter, whey for lunch.  Chicken, eggs, veggies, and rice for dinner.  Also pizza and ice cream once a week.  Aiming for a recomp or cut.

**Results:**

Front squat 1RM: 255lbs belted to 285lbs beltless. I belted up and attempted 300lbs twice, but failed it both times.

Front squat 3RM: 225lbs to 227.5lbs... for 10 sets.

Bodyweight: Gained one pound, but my abs and thighs are noticeably leaner.

Thighs: Started at 24"" and went to 25""

Clean PR went from 215lbs to 220lbs (after missing it 7 times). 

**Thoughts on the Results:**

I feel like I could have made 300lbs if a) I had rested a week instead of a few days, b) if I hadn't done a weightlifting session the day before, and c) I had been bulking instead of recomping.  But, I didn't do those things, so I just have a PR of 30lbs.  I'm pretty happy with that. 

I think that lowballing my max was a good idea.  Working off a lower max than my real PR helped me get all the work in without pushing myself to give 100% every session.  It's possible that my gains could have been better with a higher max, but I also might have burnt myself out and failed on the last week.

How did this affect my back squat, clean, or any other lift?  I don't know -- I can only imagine that moving my beltless front squat max to 96% of my belted back squat max moved it up, but I haven't tested.  I'm still in an acclimation phase for weightlifting, after injuring my wrist coming into it too quick, but I tested a max clean and attempted a 5lb PR 8 times before finally making it.  So the strength difference between my max clean and my max front squat went from 84% to 77%.

I really enjoyed the program, and it boosted the fuck out of my front squat without beating me up too much.  I'll probably run this again at some point.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1gshjj,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1gshjj/program_review_smolov_jr_for_front_squats/,

Also, I guess this club is sort of full of a bunch of slackers as for the last two nights (my first two) it has just been me and one of the coaches, he's pretty young (28?) but says he's been doing this since he was 15 and is giving me lots of good pointers.

We're taking things slow for now as my form is of course terrible and my shoulder flexibilty isn't quite up to par for a proper clean yet.

Just got  hold of a video from my most recent comp last month in Glasgow, Scotland. 
With hindsight, I know I came in a bit optimistically with openers that were too big but it serves me right!
I'd competed a few times prior to this comp with pbs of about 110/130. This comp was the 1st one I'd taken seriously and began this 12 week program ( http://www.catalystathletics.com/workouts/cycle.php?cycleID=45) to prep for it. I really enjoyed the leg strength phase but found myself becoming a bit fed up with the comp prep part. I just felt my heart wasn't in it for some reason. 

Diet wise, I ate whatever I wanted &amp; supplemented with protein and creatine. 

Pbs in training running up the comp were 120 snatch, 160 clean and a lowly 140 jerk (needs work)

One the day I went;
120x
120
125x

140xxx

Was really disappointed with myself for 1) opening too big for my jerk ability and 2) not training the jerk enough and relying on comp nerves to get it up!

If I made my openers, I would have placed 2nd.

Future training. Get the 125 and really train the jerk. I feel I should be getting 125/155 at current strength levels. 

Next time!

About a month or so ago I got curious about Oly lifting, and watched Pendlay's videos and decided to just dive in. At first, it was obvious despite my rehab my left shoulder was still very stiff and not very flexible. I realize the purpose of the surgery was to stiffen my labrum so it wouldnt tear, thus the inflexibility. I improved my snatch over the last month, going from barely able to overhead squat the bar, to now doing 60kg very comfortably (I can also muscle snatch 60kg so its obvious right now its just learning my technique and getting the second pull down). I read through Greg Everett's book and Im following through that while I do Pendlay's beginner program. 

To my question, last week just goofin around with friends we played capture the flag. I threw out both my arms trying to tag someone and I felt a sort of click, or possibly a subluxation in my left shoulder. No dislocation as far as I know, but my shoulder hurt, and oddly enough so did my elbow. 

As far as my doctor and PT specialist said, after 6mths plus, lifting above my head is perfectly fine and it should be back to 100% with little chance of dislocation. But doing research shows lots of other opinions, everything from I should just avoid snatches alltogether (due to the precarious position a proper overhead squat puts you in) because the scar tissue is never strong enough, to the exact opposite that scar tissue can be stronger then the original tear.

I feel no real pain perse when overhead squatting. I feel pain when I screw up my second pull and just muscle it over my head instead of properly scarecrowing and using knee+hip extension.

TLDR: My question is, at what point should I really reconsider snatching? I feel comfortable continue doing C&amp;Js, as that overhead position doesn't feel that unstable. My reasoning for doing Oly lifting is just fun, I love the technical aspect of it as opposed to just mindless benchpressing and rows that I've done in the past and its been a real good motivator for me. I also train BJJ so I like the explosiveness its supposed to aid me in. I probably won't compete, I just enjoy doing explosive, technical style weightlifting.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1bdjg5,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1bdjg5/knowing_the_risks_and_rewards_of_olympic_lifting/,

I myself actually went the reverse road, I started out as a member of my cities weightlifting club and did that for about half a year. The club itself was pretty half-assed with a few members making it out a few times a week, many nights I was uncoached as the two coaches seemed to lack interest in the floundering club and seemed to have lost interest in the sport as well.


We trained at a crossfit gym after all the classes were done and I got to know the head coach there, obviously a crossfit advocate but prior to this a seasoned weightlifter who's worked with the likes of Greg Everett and several other strength training big shots. From my time around this crossfit gym I saw that a lot of these coaches really knew what they were talking about, even seeing them in action with impressive lifts. After a lifting hiatus for travel I came back and joined the crossfit gym (the weightlifting club has become even less stable than before). I'm currently follow a strength-biased program designed by the gym geared towards those with an interest in developing their lifts and couldn't be happier. The coaching I receive here is top notch and I like crushing myself with a crossfit workout once in a while. The gym itself is a place dreams are made of as well with enough bars, bumper plates and floor space for a large number of lifters to train simultaneously.


I can appreciate that crossfit is not necessarily designed for weightlifters, and the coaches at my gym even recognize the difference between a crossfit lift and a weightlifting lift (you will not miss a lift according to crossfit standards if you press it out) but I can't say anything negative about this gym. From my experiences I always defend crossfit but I realize a lot of people must have had bad experiences for so much hate to have developed towards crossfit on the fitness scene.


I guess I'm just wondering about the consensus here and how many people might even be here solely because of crossfit.

So I've found out who it is, and I can't tell whether he is a quack or not.

So, it is a 2 month course, an hour a week, for $250. The course is run by [Karsten Jensen](http://www.yestostrength.com/karsten-jensen-bio.html). From his bio he is more of a general conditioning coach opposed to a weightlifting coach.

He mentions some decent accomplishments, but... his back squat is the same as mine (300 lbs) and he's been training for 13 years. I have been training for a year. He also mentions his 7%BF level (wtf) as an achievement. 

My goals are fitness and general awesomeness. I'd like to perfect my clean form, and I think the Olympic lifts are just cool, but I am not feeling that this course is worth it. I might learn enough from a day-long seminar to practice on my own. It seems it would almost be a better investment to buy a pair weightlifting shoes than this course.

Thoughts? Thanks in advance.

Edit: Thanks everyone for confirming my suspicions. I've decided to sign up for a 2-day NCCP club coaching course in October, which will give me the intro I need to keep working, and contacts in my area.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,1345032045.0,,,True,t3_y7gxe,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/y7gxe/help_evaluating_olympic_lifting_courseinstructor/,

Right now, I can only dead lift it. With my remaining 4 months here, I want to get it to a rack position anyway how, safely.

What are progressions I can do to work up to it? It does not have to be olympic style. Anyway, anyhow (that won't injure me) is what I'll do. 

I was thinking

1. Sumo-deadlift it, perhaps using the crook of my elbow instead of the hand

2. *Somehow* (I need suggestions) get my hands in the position of a front squat.
3. Front squat the bar until I am standing.
4. Then if I ever get the strength, press it.

Just spitball with me. Anyway (that's safe) to get a weight off the ground and up for carrying seems like real strength to me. Its all I have to work with and its something I want to do.

In October changed clubs and coaches and went from the 85-77kg to 62kg following a pretty strict paleo style diet. I've spent those month completely remaking my technique. I train 4 days a week either at a highschool or in my coaches garage. I pretty much only take fish oil. I train under Christine Girards training style (she is my coach) don't know what its based off its kinda of what she's found works for her and changes it for each athelete. 

Meet prep: 3 training the week before tapering down to about 70 percent. Got sick a week before and that and flying from B.C. to Sask, which seems to affect me, a bit took a bit out of my recovery. I was mentally really prepared as I was trying to qualify for Nationals here.

The Lifts: I dont have videos but went 3/6 making a 79kg snatch and 106kg clean and jerk.

Snatch
79kg: make, my grip in my right hand slipped slightly making if feel slightly ackward.
82kg: miss, bar felt light but pull was a bit forward.
82kg: miss, same as second attempt but the pull was slightly better.

Clean and Jerk
101kg: make, done this lots in training so it was a nice easy lift to open with
106kg: make, another easy lift, most I've clean and jerked at this body weight, I have done 107 before but that was at a full 77kg
111kg: miss, got under but elbow touched my knee. Needed this lift to go to nationals and it was the first time I have ever tried to clean anything over 109 so Im pretty happy I at least got under it.

Final Thoughts: Bitter sweet. I did win my weight class and did fairly well in the Clean and Jerk but I didn't make my goal of a 190 total to go to Nationals. It is pushing me to work harder though changing coaches, coaching styles, technique and 2 to 3 weight classes I know I'm still a work in progress but I can feel things really coming together.

Also I have a very wide grip when I snatch, like almost at the end of the of bar.

My other question is when is: is it bad to always lower the weights and  not drop them? Could this cause shoulder pain in the future?

I've had problems with knee stiffness since I started Oly lifting. I believe that it originates in my calves, since they become very tense during loading cycles. It's in the below-parallel position that they feel stiff, sometimes there is pain while squatting.

The tension in the calves is basically everywhere, but especially just below the knee on the outside of the leg. There is also a muscle (or ligament?) which runs from the top down to the ankle which is very tense.

I can post a squat video if you'd like to see. 

I do roll out my calves, and sometimes I actually wrap my calves while squatting when they get bad. I have also experimented with knee flossing.

I've talked to different coaches, different lifters, and different forums and it's all subjective. I've developed a mental block from hitting it off the bone, the pain just gets in the way.

Here's the other thread:http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/18spe5/unusually_large_collarbone_now_causing_pain_when/

So I got the MRI results back and here's what the report said:

""There is edema about the mid shaft of the right clavicle along its anterior, superior and posterior margins, with HIGH-GRADE AVULSION of the clavicular head of the sternocliedomastoid muscle. The sternal head remains attached. There is no evidence of a soft tissue mass as questioned. Bone marrow signal is unremarkable. Tere is evidence of a prior Mumford procedure at the right acromial clavicular joint. The sternoclavicular joint appears normally aligned.""

Essentially my clavicle has detached from my sternocliestomastoid muscle of my neck. The muscle however is still attached to the sternum. Doctor said to give the injury site 1-2 months to heal via scar tissue, but even after it heals the muscle will remain detached. I'm set to lift at the Arnold next week, and the doc suggested I drop out of the Arnold and not do anything with the front rack position for 1-2 months to let it heal, HOWEVER once it heals I will be more susceptible to clavicle injuries because of the detachment unless I get it surgically reattached. Not sure if all of that is 100% accurate but thats what I got out of the visit.

Any advice?!,zodam,9,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/14jwam/the_jerk_is_my_weakest_lift_of_the_three_any/,"My jerk is never consistent. I have so many problems with the jerk. My coach tells me that usually I don't get my head through, or I end up jerking forward.

I find when I concentrate on jerking straight up and behind my head I lose power, whenever I generate the most power out of my dip, I jerk forward. I just cant conceptualize the movement. Like when I go up to the snatch, I think of certain cues, I know what I have to do to perform the lift correctly, same with the clean. But when I approach the jerk, there is just so much running through my mind, and I just cant generate as much force when trying to concentrate on the movement. And when I do generate enough force, I end up enforcing my bad habbit of a forward jerk. Also, Its never ever consistant. My max is a 118 jerk in competition, but in training Ill be lucky if I can ever work up to 110. I only seem to make heavy jerks in competition!

Below are some videos of some of my clean and jerks. Note the video of the local meet my snatches were forward, toe centered, and they were power snatches. Since then I have really fixed my snatch to the point where its my most comfortable lift. I got that number up from 90-94kg and just barely missed 96 the other day. Anyways the first video is the most recent, the second video is an older meet from september. Note the 120kg jerk attempt at the end. If I jerked it a little bit more straight overhead I would not have had to fight to save it.

Goals for next week will be the same thing.

I have very little experience as a mod, but because of the relative small size of the subreddit, I think I will have no problem handling the few issues that will arise.


Now you are all probably used to a hands off mod, as I said before the previous mod hasn't been on in almost 7 months.

If anyone wants to help me with the subreddit design that would be awesome, nothing major but I would like to steer away from a default subreddit look.

Heres what I am thinking so far:

* New alien &amp; header bar
* Flair for everyone! my current flair is an example, but I would also like the ability to put a small flag beside (L or R) the flair. 
* Like in /r/weightroom, proof of total will be required, be it a video or competition sheet, as well as some proof of your weight (or weight class)
* a FAQ, this will be a large undertaking, I'm not quite sure what to put in it at the moment, but I'll work on that over the next few weeks.
* Weeky/Daily discussion threads like in /r/fitness and /r/weightroom, any ideas that aren't already present on fitness or weightroom would be awesome!
* Sidebar picture! Again, I need to do some reading and figure out how to get all of this CSS stuff going, but I'll probably go with a monthly/bi-monthly sidebar picture

Any questions or volunteers to help me out?

Don't hesitate to post here or PM me if you wanna keep stuff private!

Thanks guys &amp; gals!

I'm a 31 year old guy who has been fucking around in the gym to and from for a long time. For the last few months I’ve been doing a general strength training routine based around the big four lifts and kettlebell work.

I’ve had the luck of finding what seems to be a nice, competitive WL gym, and will have my first coached session in a few days. Pretty damn excited about this.

I do have some strength from prior training for the big 4. I consider myself a novice, strength-wise, but not a complete beginner.

Since I very much enjoy planning for my training, I can’t help brooding over what my program will look like.

I’ve looked at a lot of the beginner programs from Pendlay’s, Catalyst athletics etc. WL seems more difficult to program than PL/general strength training. On 70sbig I found [this template]( http://70sbig.com/blog/2012/07/transitioning-to-olympic-weightlifting/):

&gt;**Monday**  
Snatch  
Clean and Jerk

&gt;**Tuesday**  
High bar squat  
Press*  
Rows

&gt;**Thursday**  
Snatch  
Clean and Jerk  

&gt;**Friday**  
Front squat  
Bench*  
RDL  

I love working out, so frequency is not an issue, as far as motivation goes. I’d be happy to train five times a week as well. But the question is if it is better to focus more on technique and put strength on the backburner for now? I’d be glad to do so if it allows me more frequency (and faster results!). Is it advisable at all to train the main lifts (with no/light weights) more than 3 times week for a beginner?

Does basic kettlebell exercises carry over at all? Or is that time better invested in technique grinding as well?

Please excuse my rambling ignorance, feel free to ask for clarification if needed.

Obviously I will discuss these questions with my coach. I am slowly forming my own ideas about this as well. But I would be very grateful for any input you could provide. All perspectives are valuable at this point.

* 186cm (+1cm from last meet :o), 87.4kg., 17 Years Old
* Training 4-5x a week since January 2
* Train for olympic lifting primarily (I also do high-school only PL meets)
* Second WL Meet (2 PL meets under my belt as well)
* Paleo from January to about June, now I eat primarily Paleo with some additional carb sources (Oats, some bread, rice etc)
* Multivite, Vit D, Vit C daily, Optimum Platnium Pre before each workout
* I've been training so hard to try and get a 211kg or 215kg to qualify for Nationals or Provincials and I end up entering the competition with a 191kg training total, I'll get it next year!


**Meet Prep**

* Not a huge amount of prep for this meet, didn't need to cut weight, though I could have been an 85, I decided it's not worth dropping the weight for a short-term goal like this meet
* Cooked a simple rice + sweet potato mix the night before to chow on after weigh ins.
* Brought some bananas to snack on too, food seems to pass through my stomach quickly, my regular preworkout meal is 1c oats, 1c blueberries drizzled in honey 30 min before I go to the gym (45m before lifting)


**The Lifts**	

Went 2/6 on my lifts, only hitting my openers, and missing a *questionable* C&amp;J

[Video of all 6 lifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKfw4jzb9GY)

**Snatch**

* 77kg - my opener, training PR is 84.5kg, I am not very tight at the bottom of either snatch or C&amp;J and I need to work on this
* 81kg - my other weakness is not fully extending and having to chase the bar forward
* 81kg - no lift, the nerves really got the better of me during warmup and the competition lifts.

**Clean and Jerk**

* 98kg - training PR is 107kg. felt good, been using a narrow clean grip &amp; popping it out wide at the top recently and it's been working well.
* 102kg - I think I missed this b/c I kept my front foot forward for too long after the jerk, crappy way to miss a lift
* 107kg - pressout


**Results**

Walked out with a **175kg total** and (Technically) the #1 Junior in my class, the other junior lifter (J. B. Spencer - Ontarios actual #1 junior) bombed out and went 1/6. Happy to hit a 200+ sinclair in compeition, disappointed I nearly bombed out though.

**Records**

Broke no PRs or federation records

**Final Thoughts**

* Pretty disappointed in myself
* I was really working on getting a more consistent snatch and my nerves really messed with my head during that part of the compeition
* Next WL meet is February 9

Basically I would be doing Bill starr's 5x5 but I would like to change the PC on mon &amp; fri to Clean &amp; jerk and on wednesday change the deadlift to snatch. (my deadlifts is already way ahead of my other lifts.)

My question is, how many sets,reps &amp; at what % of max should I be doing these olympic lifts? I've looked around a bit, and what I currently have come up with is:
warmup to about 80%, do 3 sets of doubles. Than 2-3 sets of 85 doubles, after this 90%, 3 sets of singles and than 4-5 backoff sets of doubles with 85 &amp;80% . 

And then add about 2.5% on the oly lifts each week?

Does this sound good?

So,quick recap: 
Monday(heavy): squat 5x5, bench 5x5, C&amp;J multiple sets @ 80,85,90% 
Wednesday (light): squat 4x5 (low weight), OHP 4x5, snatch multiple sets @ 80,85,90%  
Friday (heavy): squat 4x5,1x3,1x8 , Bench same, c&amp;j same as monday.  
Next Monday = +2.5 on c&amp;j

Next to that, tuesday &amp; thursday are metcons (read as crossfit workouts). 
Yes I know this isn't optimal and that there are better programs avaible, but I would like to keep a full body program without to much assistance . My diet is good so I think I can keep going for a while.The only assistance I would be doing would be abs + chinups. 

Currently my stats are (1RM in kg):
backsquat 140
bench 85-90
DL 185
OHP  ~57.5
Clean&amp;Jerk 85kg 
Snatch about 70kg, never tried max
and this at a BW of 85kg (~14% BF)

My understanding is that during the second pull the combination of ankle, knee, and hip extension, as well as shrugging of the shoulders is what gets the weight moving upwards quickly, with most of the contribution coming from hip extension. I'm looking for insight on how hip extension translates into an upward force on the bar, since the hips move horizontally.

In trying to learn how to clean I've developed a habit of smacking the bar against my thighs violently in order to get the bar moving quickly. This seems to work, and feels natural to me, but I've read that smacking the thighs against the bar shouldn't be relied on as a way to get the bar moving vertically. Which makes sense because doing so really makes the bar move horizontally. I suspect it's only because I haven't been using heavy weights that thigh smacking has worked for me so far and that my understanding of how to get the weight moving vertically needs improvement.

So if not thigh smacking then how exactly ""should"" I get the weight moving upward quickly?",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1klloh,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1klloh/im_looking_to_understand_how_the_weight_is/,

I've been dealing with hip pain for a few months now which is exacerbated by squatting. I had initially believed it was a hernia, but my doctor said I was hernia free.

More recently, I went to the doctor again, and he believed it is internal snapping hip syndrome, and gave me some stretches and strengthening exercises to do. However, I've started experiencing a burning sensation at my hip near the top of my thigh during heavy squat sets. The first 3 reps will be fine, but the 4th and 5th bring about what I can only describe as someone holding a lighter a few inches from my skin. It isn't painful, but it's definitely perceivable and very disconcerting.

I can't go back to the doctor about this right now because I am abroad for a few months, and any non-emergency medical visits would be too expensive.

Now this occurred at the ac joint, but the bone spurs were technically on the clavicle. After recovering I got into Olympic Weightlifting (crossfit background before the surgery... This is how I injured my AC joint in the first place). I noticed that medial (correct term?) end of my clavicle on the surgery side is incredibly large and is often hit with the barbell during the process of catching a clean. Now I've been weightlifting for about 8 months, and the only problem I've ever had was scratches and scars on my neck above the protruding collar bone, but recently I widened my grip for the jerk to fix some efficiency issues. Since assuming this wider grip the large protruding collar bone has began hurting. It wasn't really apparent until yesterdays workout when I basically could not clean due to the pain on my clavicle from receiving the bar. I also gave up on the wider jerk grip because when I adjust my hands outwards it the bar pretty much rests on my clavicle not my delts. My guess is it's a bone bruise. Today I folded up my beanie and put that in my shirt to cushion it but I'm not really quite sure what I can do about it. ""resting"" would involve not doing any clean and jerks. I cannot afford to do that because I have the Arnold coming up as well as Collegiate Nationals. Not sure if the surgery has anything to do with it but I thought I'd let you know about it.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Heres an image. SFW unless you don't want to see an unusually large clavicle and the top of a shirtless dude.

Once I started snatching 100kg I suddenly began to get horrendous callous tearing on both hands (mainly below my ring and middle fingers).

So, as not to continue aggravating the problem I began lifting w/Straps.  However, I've never liked using them.

At first I thought the maths were going to be hairy (1 year out of uni and I'm already losing my edge!) but it turned out to be deceptively simple.

For women to compare yourself to men, using sinclair, simply calculate your regular [sinclair](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Coefficients) score, then multiply it by 472/328 (= 1.44).

For example, if we take the womens 58 kg world record of 251 kg, the sinclair coefficient for women @ 58kg is 1.31. 

So 251 * 1.31 * 1.44 = 475 ... which is just slightly more than Rezazadeh's 472 WR.

For an example closer to home, lets compare an average-ish woman with an average-ish male (63 kg and 81 kg respectively).

The woman's ""sex-adjusted"" sinclair is 1.24 * 1.44 = 1.79, while the man's sinclair is 1.42. So if the male totals 182kg (bodyweight snatch with 101kg CJ) then that works out to be 222 sinclair points. For the woman to get 222 sinclair points she needs to total 124 which would equate to a SN/CJ of 55/69. 

Of course, the women's sinclair formula should be changing relatively soon because several total records were broken in the last olympic cycle, but the formula will still apply.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_16dahv,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/16dahv/comparing_men_and_women_using_sinclair/,

1342902496.0,5,self.weightlifting,wxqlb,!st meet. Bombed out.  Very frustrated.,hosemonkey,6,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/wxqlb/st_meet_bombed_out_very_frustrated/,"Just had my 1st meet.  Went 1 for 6.  Pretty terrible.  It was unsanctioned so not a huge deal,  but still not how I wanted to start.  Everything is in lbs.  

Snatch: 205 (miss) 205 (make) 225(miss) 

-The 205s were easy weights for me.  I chalk the 1st miss to jitters.  I hit 215 easily in the warm up area so I went a little bigger for my last lift.  I will have to see the pictures to see what went wrong there but it wasn't close.

Clean and jerk: 255 (miss) 285  (miss) 285 (miss)
No idea what happened here.  I went with 255 as an opener because it is a sure thing for me.  Apparently I was wrong.  I had a small press out and got no repped. 285 should have been a sure thing.  This is not a hard c&amp;j for me.  I actually can't remember the last time I failed 285 in practice, but it has been months. I failed it twice.  Very disappointing.  

One thing I didn't like about this meet was they set the rotation based on weights (lighter to heavier), but then went straight through the rotation despite what your 2nd and 3rd attempts would be.  I would have much rather followed myself after a miss than sitting through an entire rotation for 25 minutes and trying to find a balance between staying warm and not getting exhausted.  Also it was tough not trying to psych yourself out after a miss and then sitting for 25 minutes.  

So lessons learned:
-A ""sure thing"" lift doesn't really exist for a meet.
-Go to a sanctioned meet because they will do something goofy if the rules aren't in place.
-practice more.

I started off with the typical bodybuilding crap and got into powerlifting. After working out a few times with an olympic lifter in my gym I've fallen in love with the sport. 

Anyway, I've been going through the beginner program on the Catalyst Athletics site with some pretty light weight. The gym I'm forced to use during the summer has no bumper plates so it kind of sucks. I made a video of myself ""attempting"" the clean &amp; jerk today with 95 lbs. I know the form is awful, but could someone please point out some things I can do to improve?

I know I should get a coach. I'm planning on joining a real gym in August!

I won't be able to do a real meet till October because all the meets are on Saturdays and clash with rugby. The main point of this was to see how I do when given *only 3 attempts*. 

I was wondering if anybody would red light any of these lifts. This is the first time I've videoed myself from the front and my lockout in the snatch didn't look as strong as it feels, maybe close to being a pressout at times?

I have a recurring habit where snatches get too far in front of me, my arms are locked out but the weight is just too far forward for me to stand up, I've been trying to work on it but still hangs around like a bad smell. Any good ideas to correct this?

I've been lifting heavy every day so I was going to do some technique work.

I decided to try Ilya's approach to lifting, just hook grip and pull. I started doing them, they all felt great. Normally I have more of a Klokov approach, sitting there for a while with the bar.

Doing them this way my butt was much higher, and the 1st pull always felt way smoother which was nice. Then I'd get to the explosion and everything felt amazingly light, and not only that, it put me into this mental state of pure confidence. There was no thinking, there was just doing, you walk to the bar and you lift it.

Everything went up. I managed to power clean and jerk my max clean and jerk, and it felt easy. I went 20lbs over my max, cleaned it and even attempted a jerk. I've never attempted a jerk even close to that weight, so I was stoked. 

I highly recommend everyone to at least give this approach a try and see how you feel, because for me it's like a whole revelation now, and I still feel great after putting everything I had into every lift. Considering it's my 6th day in a row, and I'm usually pretty dead after training, this is an awesome feeling.

I went all mothaphuckin Ilya Ilin on that bitch. Power clean and jerked my max clean and jerk easily. ",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1geg01,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1geg01/completely_changed_my_clean_approach_had_the_best/,

I decided to rest even longer (1+ month) of no intense knee action and finally decided to hit the weights again after the swelling in my knee finally subsided. Things were going well but some issues have caused me to have discomfortin both of my knees at the very bottom on my squat. It got bad to the point where I stopped lifting yet again. 

Don't know where to go from here. I'm thinking the problem of my newfound knee discomfort is from inflexible calves and a lack of ankle mobility, as it feels my feet slightly cave at the deepest part of a squat, and the pain kicks in when I attempt to get out of the bottom position. 

Anyone have any insight? I'm doing calf stretches, ankle mobility work, but I wondered if anyone here had specific things they did for knee help hat directly helps Olympic lifts.

5'9"" 84-85kg bw. Currently training 4 times per week, but two of those sessions are just training one accessory lift (either clean pull or some type of squat). I am trying to get back into training after a busy couple months on hospital electives (I am entering my final year of medical school), during which I was only able to ""train"" twice a week and I lost about 4kg of bodyweight. My recovery is not that great (averaging 6hrs of sleep per weeknight), so my training has been scaled back to account for that. I also lost a bit of strength with my weightloss so I am putting the little time I have towards squats and pulls to get back some of that strength. I have made several technical changes to my pull technique and while I was spending time in different cities I have gotten input from a few other coaches and I think the small tweaks I've made to my pull are starting to show. This will be my 2nd meet this year, although this is not a qualifying meet for nationals so it is essentially just for fun. 

**Meet Prep**

I had no meet prep and just began my re-buidling cycle two weeks ago. Even though I am in horrible shape, I just felt like competing for fun, and it was held at my home gym so I wouldn't be able to train anyways. The meet was on Saturday and I'm on call at the hospital today (Sunday), so I just did the meet in lieu of my training program this weekend. I'll repeat this week of my program next week to get in the weekend training days.

**The Lifts**

Went 5/6:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHUaiGuHNXI

*Snatch*

90KG make: This was 10kg lighter than my opener at my last meet. I just came work up to a decent heavy single at this meet.

95KG make: Pretty routine.

100KG make: I haven't lifted anything over 100kg since my last meet in February, so I just wanted to go 3/3 and stick this one. 


*Clean and Jerk*

115KG make: Moved up my planned opener from 110 because I mistimed my warmups and 100 felt lighter than expected so I did 110 in the back moved my opener up to 115. 

120KG make: I haven't cleaned over 117 since my last meet in Feb, so I was happy I stood up with this. Jerk felt light. 

125KG miss: Followed myself on this one. Got pinned in the bottom of the clean, no chance of standing up. My legs are definitely weaker, but I didn't taper for this meet and I followed myself so those are my excuses. With proper meet prep this should be my opener.

**Results**

I won the 85kg division because everyone that I normally compete against in the 85's and 94's are peaking for nationals. Since this is the first meet I lifted at 85 in nearly a year, this is a 20kg total PR. 

**Final thoughts**

My strength has decreased maybe a bit more than I originally thought. Time to hammer out those squats.",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,1366584131.0,,Canada,True,t3_1ct9h8,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1ct9h8/meet_report_sask_open_regina_sk_canada_220_846/,

I'm 5'3"", 62kg class, and usually my hands are just outside the rings. However, I lose a lot of Snatches from falling on my knees, or just poor stability. Despite that, I have Snatch balanced 102kg, yet I'll lose 80kg from stability at times.

Today I tried a narrower grip. The pull felt a bit different, which I would expect, first time, but overhead felt considerably more stable. I think I'm going to try to practice this narrow grip a bit more. I know there are general rules of thumb, and guidelines, but it really seems to differ by the individual.

 The Catalyst article says that the meat of the front deltoid will be past the bar but the bar will be directly under your arms/shoulder unit. Seems like common sense enough, quickest path between two points is a straight line.

The Spencergarnold article says for the shoulders to be well in front of the bar to create more leverage. My confusion with this is that if the shoulders are way past the bar, the bar will want to move away from you so your arms will hang straight down with the bar unless you do some heavy lat involvement to keep it close.

Ive been doing weightlifting for a few months now, and its going quite well. I am having some problems progressing in the jerk and the cleans though.

How is the form on these lifts? It feels like i pulled it way to high on the clean for a squat clean, i should be able to catch that weight as a power-clean. It feels like every time i try to catch lower i lose the lift on the end of the pull. Any pointers on how to become better at getting under the bar? I dont think i am fast enough to get into a stable platform underneath it when i clean heavy, which is why i have been stuck at 90-95kg for a while. 

I am also having some problems with my snatch, but i dont have any footage of it. Last session i struck the bar on my pubic bone, which still hurts a bit. Any pointers on how not to do that? I think i am throwing my hips into the bar too hard.

This is my third post on this site. I am 16, 170 ish pounds (give or take a few pounds in the morning) and my best squat is 350 pounds. 

Here is a video:

I have just started training seriously around 4 months ago at which point my max ATG squat was around 280 pounds. I have since then attempted smolov, but failed due to time constrictions, and now I am training bulgarian style. I am not maxing 7 days a week but 4-6x a week I work up to a daily max and it has done AMAZING things to my squat. In the last month I went from 315 to 350. 


I have been weight training for about a year, and exercising for about 2.5 (meaning pushups, pullups, etc.).

Let's say I want to squat 540 @ 180, do you think this is achievable within the next 3 years?

On another note, do you think that a 400 pound squat is realistic within the next 3-4 months?

I also have a handicap of having to to go 2 different gyms:  

* gym1 where I can't drop the weights (no bumpers/platform)
* gym2 where I can drop the weights (bumpers and platforms...of sorts).

Also, since I'm a beginner, and I have technique issues I'm working on, I want a lot of time at low weight under the bar.  So, having said that, I pieced together this routine from various other routines I've found online.   Any thought or opinions would be much appreciated:


Workout A:

* 2x4 High hang snatch at 60% 1rm
* 2x4 snatch at 60% 1rm 
* 1x4 high hang C&amp;J at 60% 1rm
* 1x4 C&amp;J at 60% 1rm
* 3x5 FS

Workout B:

* 1x4 high hang snatch at 60% 1rm
* 1x4 snatch at 60% 1rm
* 2x4 high hang C&amp;J at 60% 1rm 
* 2x4 C&amp;J at 60% 1rm
* 3x5 BS

Workout C:

* 1x4 high hang snatch at 85% 1rm
* 1x4 snatch at 85% 1rm
* 1x4 high hang C&amp;J at 85% 1rm
* 1x4 C&amp;J at 85% 1rm
* 5x2 FS 

MWF (no drop gym days) I'll alternate between Workout A&amp;B, until time runs out.  Tue/Thur (I can drop gym days) I'll do Workout C also until time runs out.  I plan on not increasing the weights until I hit each workout with no missed lifts and technique I'm happy with, and once a month, I'll retest my 1RM.  

The goal at this point is first, my technique needs to be way better.  Second, adding weight.  I don't wont to do the 2nd unless/until the 1st is improving.

This is because I have a contusion on my pubic bone from banging the bar into it. I have been lifting at a club for about a month now, which is really when the problem started, before lifting here I did not make as aggressive contact with the bar to cause any problems. 

Its difficult because my max is 91kg and I've been failing 65-75kg the past week. Each time its because the pain on my pubic pone is so great that I am physiologically afraid to hit it therefore avoiding aggressive contact and losing power.

A few people have told me that its normal and you will eventually get used to it, but this pain is pretty bad.

I have tried numerous things to fix the issue. No matter how much I actively sweep the bar in and keep it close, it still hits the spot.

Also I have a very wide grip. I'm fairly lankey for my weight and grab the bar less than an inch from the collars.

I've also tried starting with my shoulders more forward over the bar, this helped a few days ago, I began hitting my waistline a bit higher (where I wear my belt rather than pubic area) but after a few reps of doing this, I began hitting the spot again, and occasionally even when I hit high (waistline) I still feel pain from the contusion a few inches below. 

Not really sure what to do. I feel like a bitch for letting this get in the way of my performance. Has anybody else had this problem? Will it just ""go away"" if I bite the bullet??

PS heres a video of me at my last meet. (this is BEFORE I adjusted my starting position to be more over the bar).

My right arm is totally fine. 

I assume it is a pulled muscle. Anyone else ever have this feeling of pain or injury that sounds similar?

**Update** ER doc gave me pain meds and a shot. Said it was a shoulder strain and to follow up with my regular doctor. The xrays didn't reveal anything wrong with the bones. Said it could be a torn or pulled muscle.  MRI would reveal the damage, but they didn't do one on me yet. Thank you all for your advice to me, a little wanna be weightlifter. 

**Update 2** It's been over a week and the pain has not gone away. This was more that just soreness. Hopefully I can get the MRI scheduled soon. I also have developed a lump just south of my clavicle that is super tender.

What I want to know is: How do I program the front squat after the initial novice stage, which I am just coming out of? Keep in mind I do not want to do back squats. I am thinking of doing a texas-method-like layout, with volume on monday, light weight on wednesday, and intensity on friday. 

How does this sound? Is there any recommended way to program them? Is there any exercise that is important to add in to prevent imbalances?",,False,self,t5_2rlwc,False,,,True,t3_1g2feb,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/1g2feb/programming_front_squats/,

There's something exhilarating about throwing weight over your head, and this got me interested in Olympic weightlifting as a great way to get in shape.

Coincidentally, I actually found out there's a gym very close to my house that specializes in nothing but Olympic weightlifting, with 10 platforms and a very talented coach - this made me interested in learning Oly lifting and using it as a foundation for building strength and getting in better shape.

What are your thoughts? Is this a sport where I can reasonably start ""from scratch"", or should I build up strength with traditional powerlifting first before starting to learn any Olympic lifts?

4th Meet ever
BW: 91.89

Things started off hectic, with the power in the weigh-in area going out, and having issues with the computer program. Finally got weighed in with about an hour before we're scheduled to lift. The group ahead of me was running about an hour behind, so we went from feeling rushed to being anxious pretty quick.

Warm ups for the snatch went well, although I was way ahead of schedule, I was the second to last lifter and was not used to that at all.

Snatch 1. 95 - Miss
Power snatched it...and fell over. Video tells me I was way on my right toes as is normal for me, I have very little dorsiflexion in my right ankle...and then I fell over.

Snatch 2. 98 - Miss
Bar was far out in front, brought it back in but overcorrected and swung it out again and lost it behind. Very important lesson here:
Guys...TUCK DOWN! I smashed my ""unit"" on this lift, and was crippled as soon as I got off the platform. I was following myself, so I had 2 minutes to a) hold my dick and try not to cry b) explain that the medical staff probably couldn't help me c) run around and try to find a bathroom d) get ready for my third attempt. So I tucked it down, and headed out for:

Snatch 3: 98 - Success!
Through the miserable pain, just grabbed the bar and did what I can easily do. Power snatched it, no problem, sprinted off the stage to the bathroom.

Clean and jerk warm-ups went well, easy as expected and this time I was way behind schedule which is probably actually better for me.

Clean and Jerk 1: 115 Good
This was simple, I wish every lift felt that good. Realistically should have been my last warm up.

Clean and Jerk 2: 121 No lift
Got called for a press out. I felt it, I knew it, but it was really quite minor. I'm ok with this one though.

Clean and Jerk 3. 123 No lift
Smashed this for a 2 kg PR. Felt simple, and completely solid overhead. And then: 3 red paddles. Genuinely have no idea what they saw, but it wasn't my lift. Oh well. That's the way it goes I guess.

Overall, I wasn't too happy with this meet. I did well enough to qualify for the 94 class at Collegiate Nationals, so that's all I really needed. But between feeling totally robbed and having a bruised and swollen package, I mostly wanted to just cry. So I picked up a 500 pound set of tractor tires a couple times, drank a bunch of beers, and feel better now.

This is my current PR, but form is an ongoing project I feel, even though I've been doing them for 6 months.

From what I can tell I don't go into full triple extension and I'm pulling a bit with my arms. I think that if I think about leaning back more on the pull while keeping my arms straight for as long as possible that should do the trick.

Is the starting position good? My grip width is slightly narrower than my bench grip, and the bar hits right below my hips when my arms are extended. Is this perhaps not wide enough?

I've had a problem recently with the bar landing a bit forward on my right shoulder so that I have to hike it up after racking it, sort of. This puts some strain on my shoulder. You can see it on the last rep. Any ideas on what's causing this?

I just wanted to provide an update since I think this sub likes to see progress from regular lifters like you and I, and not always olympic level guys...

I am about 3-4 months into oly lifting now and I had some pretty bad tendonitis right above my knee for a bit, which limited my progress for awhile.  However, the magic bullet was basically my coach having me pulling from boxes just above my knee, where I would not be able to gain any momentum from the lift.  It was just violent shrug and drop under like your life depended on it.  This really taught my muscle memory to get under the bar and pull all the way to the hips.  Since then we did a lot of 3/2/1s and eventually reached a point where i'm starting to catch closer to the bottom.  I literally went from a max of 105kg to 124kg in 2 weeks...

Here is my initial 3/2/1 where I got to about a 2 rep of 105kg:

But here it is again:

I'm in the hunt for a camera solution for capturing my training for analysis purposes. I have tried the [Microsoft LifeCam Studio](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-LifeCam-Studio-1080p-Webcam/dp/B0042X8NT6), but in low light it adjusts its framerate to be unacceptably slow. Other things I didn't particularly like about that camera is that I never seemed to get HD-quality or anything over 640x480 (but that could have been due to the software I was using for capture) and the flexible attachment for the camera stand caused the picture to shake a LOT every time I dropped the weight. I didn't really mind that it didn't have a microphone.

The camera must be able to be used as a capture device on a PC over USB - I do NOT have an HDMI input. It must be able to mount on a standard tripod, and it must get a minimum framerate of ~20fps in relatively low light (I'm not a photographer - am I looking for a larger f-stop number?).

Higher-quality camcorders tend to not allow themselves to be USB capture devices, and it's not enough to have to download videos after the fact. I don't *need* full-HD video or all the bells and whistles of a camcorder, especially since it seems to be at least as expensive to purchase the hardware I'd need to allow my computer to capture directly from the cam. As far as I know, webcams are the only obvious choices, but which ones meet my minimum needs? That kind of information doesn't quite seem to be available online or in reviews.

If we can talk freely, I thought this would be an interesting topic:

1. Which method, either for Cleaning or Snatching, is the most difficult? 

2. Which allows you to lift the most weight/least weight? 

3. What does each focus more on, over another, and why would someone want to do hang over blocks? (as an example)

To define the terms:

**Hang:** Starting from the bar on the ground, the bar is picked up and fully locked out. Essentially a 1st pull without a 2nd. Then, the bar is lowered to a specified height, (knee/hip), and the 2nd pull is then engaged.

**Pause:** Starting from the bar on the ground, the bar is picked up, and motion is paused during the 1st pull at a specified height. Motion then resumes, and the 1st pull is finished, and you go into the 2nd pull and complete the lift.

**Blocks:** The bar starts on blocks, at a certain height. Usually this eliminates most, if not all, of the 1st pull, and makes one go into the 2nd pull almost from the start, depending on exact block height. 

(If you feel any of these definitions are incorrect/not suffice, let me know and I will edit it)

To help injury prevention,Im_The_Boss,8,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/weightlifting/comments/136rpz/yoga_weighlifting_to_help_injury_prevention/,"Hey guys, I've been lifting on and off about a year now and throughout this time I have had a few previous injuries aggravated now and then. From this I've began to wonder if there was something I could incorporate into my weight training routine to try and cure these problems and be proactive with my body. I do try and stretch/foam roll things at home but I'm not sure it's really enough for me.


Right now my SI joint (lower back) has really been bothering me and seizing up/spasming when I over work it. As your lower back is getting worked pretty much non-stop with weightlifting this is a serious problem for me. I attribute this mainly to tight hamstrings and other muscles, I'm not very flexible.


Long story short here I've decided to join a yoga place in december ($40 for the first month unlimited!) and pull back a bit with my training. This is a 'hot yoga' place called moksha (a chain) and I think they practice their own branded form of bikram as well as some hatha yoga (I've just been doing some reading last night, the terminology is all very new to me). I'm thinking something like 3 days lifting (one light day, purely technique) and 3 days yoga each week, hopefully after a month or so I can return to my 4 or 5/week lifting and throw in yoga a couple times for maintenance. Does anyone have experience with this? Am I going to over train myself? Should I do yoga on the same day as lifting or alternate, if so before/after? Thanks guys.

I have taken whey isolate protein powder since I started my training. Lately, I have found that it is getting harder to gain strength and physique. I suppose this makes sense if say, you are supposed to have only a certain consistent percent increase in weight lifted each week. 

Is it safe for me to take creatine if I train 3x a week and do cardio once a week? I understand most concepts- the loading phase, water retention, and cycles, etc.
