UK Food Standards Agency labelling guidelines were adopted in principle by the European Union in 2010, and following a five year period for compliance civil suits may be brought against anyone misusing the terms from 2015.

Natural, Organic, Vegetarian.  And now with bird feet. 

Yes, you read that right.  Bird feet.  

I was at work today, casually eating my lunch which included a microwavable frozen lasagne dish; specifically, Amy's Kitchen Light &amp; Lean Spinach Lasagne.  About 3/4 of the way through my meal, I bit down on something tough.  Assuming it was just a tough piece from the spinach plant, I pulled it out of my mouth to set it aside.

Wait a second - is that a CLAW?  Yes, two of them in fact.  Not wanting to believe what I was seeing, but forced to inspect more closely, I observed that what I'd just pulled out of my mouth was a bird foot, with 2 claws still intact.  A bird foot.  I immediately felt sick to my stomach, and began to wonder how this could happen.  I don't even want to think about where the rest of this bird ended up.

After taking many pictures and becoming quite the spectacle among my colleagues, I set about contacting Amy's Kitchen via their website to share my experience.  I sent them a message via their provided web form at approximately 1pm PST.  I followed up with a phone call (there was no answer so I left a message) just before 3pm PST.  As of this posting, I have yet to receive any response from them. 

I am putting this out there so that people who purchase these products are made aware of this company's apparent lack of quality control.  I think it's also important to share this with people who are serious vegetarians as this almost certainly represents a significant issue for them.  In any case, I think this company having birds flying around their factories is almost certainly a Health Code violation.

Here are the photos that I captured immediately after this awful discovery.  I'll update with the company's response if/when I receive one.  

Right after I spit the thing out:

Then I carefully rinsed away the spinach/sauce to better see what this awful thing is:

This is the product packaging, for anyone who wants to know what to avoid (although I'd recommend avoiding anything from Amy's Kitchen):

http://i.imgur.com/Cik5YEg.jpg




UPDATE 1:  At about 6:00p PST 30JAN13, I posted one of these photos on Amy's Facebook page to see if I could inspire some motion on their end.

UPDATE 2:  At about 6:40p PST 30JAN13, Amy's responded on Facebook with the following: 
""Hi Joshua. Thank you for bringing this to our attention. Usually we are more prompt with our responses--our apologies. We have received your email and we'll contact you tomorrow morning. Thank you.""  Not surprisingly, they also removed my photo from their Facebook Timeline.  

UPDATE 3:  We're nearing 11:00a PST 31JAN13, still no contact from Amy's other than the above.  

UPDATE 4:  11:40a PST 31JAN13.  Amy's finally contacted me.  A nice woman called and apologized for the situation, then requested that I send the items to them to assist in their investigation.  I confirmed with her they had all relevant information related to the product in question (lot code, upc, etc) but declined to send them the items at this time.  They said they would contact me with what they find out. 

UPDATE 5: 11:45a PST 1FEB13. Amy's responded to me in email. Apologized, offered coupons for complimentary meals. Still claiming they didn't contact me due to not having my info, and provided a story that they had an IT problem with their contact form (but forgot that I left a VM too). 

UPDATE 6: 1:35p PST 1FEB13.  I'm not sure when it happened, but at some point after I quoted the amy's website as saying ""We make everything by hand."", they seem to be trying to hide that part of their website and are now redirecting menu clicks from &gt;About Us&gt;Our Kitchen to &gt;Products.  At the time of this writing, if you know the URL, the page will still work ([url]http://www.amys.com/about-us/our-kitchen[/url]).  Because I think ahead, I already have screen captures of all the original website content.  And the more of this shady behavior I see, the more angry I get. 

UPDATE 7: 4:30p PST 1FEB13.  I just noticed that employees of Amy's have been snooping on my LinkedIn profile.  Interesting.

Both my brother(21) and my sister(17) are vegetarians as well. I am an ovo-lacto vege, but do not eat fish, as they are animals.

My mother assures me that if we should decide to start eating meat, she would accept our choices, but the idea has never occurred to me. I simply don't see the need for meat, and don't want to kill when it's unnecessary. The way i see it, we no longer need meat to survive. It's no longer for sustenance, it's for pleasure, and I don't kill for pleasure. I don't begrudge a lion his gazelle because he needs it to survive, and were I stranded in the woods or on an island, I would hunt, because it then becomes a matter of survival. The distinction i think is clear. We are creatures of reason, so we should require reason to kill. 

Having never eaten meat, there is no temptation with which i have to struggle, which is great. I am, however, looking forward to lab-grown meat, which i would eat without a thought, as nothing died or suffered for it to be made. 

As for my health, I am 5'10 (178cm) at 135lb (61 kg). This may sound very skinny, but my father and grandfather both have similar frames, and my grandfather is not a vegetarian.

1340127109.0,138,self.vegetarian,va9j0,An unexpected side-effect of being a meat-loving vegetarian.,xatrinka,153,15,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/va9j0/an_unexpected_sideeffect_of_being_a_meatloving/,"I chose to become a vegetarian about six months ago, after watching a few disturbing documentaries about the way animals are treated in the meat industry. However, I love and miss the taste of meat. Big juicy red steaks, fried chicken, hot dogs... sigh. In spite of that, it hasn't been too hard, since I feel like my choices in the matter go way beyond myself as a person.

Jump ahead to six months later, it's summer time and I'm getting serious about losing weight. In the past week, I've cut almost all grains and sugars out of my diet. Not long ago (like, two weeks), I would have thought that impossible, but since I've actually committed to it, I'm amazed at how easy it is. Since it's only been a week, I still have naughty things in my fridge: sugary juice, rye bread, popsicles... But I haven't craved any of that stuff once. If I even think I want it, I just remind myself that it's not worth the empty calories. And like that, the craving's gone, and there's no inner battle or anything.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure that six months of being a vegetarian has really given my willpower a workout. My reaction to wanting carby things now is similar to my reaction for wanting meat: I simply WILL NOT eat it, and that's that. In the past, it was hard, because eating unhealthfully would really affect no one but myself. Saying no to meat was easy because I was doing it for the animals. Turns out that's been good practice for saying no to other things.


TL;DR: Being a vegetarian has strengthened my overall willpower. 


**Edit:** A lot of people seem to be concerned that I'm not getting enough carbs, and I realized that I wasn't at all clear in this post. By grains I mostly meant refined grains, which had been a large part of my diet after I became a vegetarian (white bread, rice, pasta, etc). I still eat things like rolled oats and whole grain cereals, as well as quinoa and legumes. I did not specify, because the point of this post was my new found willpower, not my diet specifically. However, nothing gets past you guys, and I truly appreciate the concern! :D


TL;DR edit edition: I'm just cutting out refined grains and sugars, not all grains and sugars.",,False,,t5_2qm7x,1340206875.0,,,True,t3_va9j0,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/va9j0/an_unexpected_sideeffect_of_being_a_meatloving/,

1365622134.0,113,self.vegetarian,1c2zp3,A little guide for non-vegetarian ingredients. You're probably consuming animal products you don't know about.,Brodivh,139,26,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1c2zp3/a_little_guide_for_nonvegetarian_ingredients/,"I thought I'd compile a list of all the information I've gathered over the years of being a vegetarian for those who haven't done as much research into what goes into their presumably vegetarian friendly foods. I went ahead and found wikipedia links for everything I listed too. I'd encourage everyone to do their own research into these and other ingredients, especially since there is so much variation amongst vegetarians as far as what they consider to be okay to eat. 

Most people know about [gelatin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelatin#Production ), glycerin, and [rennet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet ), but what about:

[Mono- and diglycerides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglycerides#Food_additive )- A lot of the time this substance can be made with a plant-based source like soy or corn so it's important to look into this on a company to company basis. Found in a lot of foods like baked goods (bread) and ice cream.

[Vitamin D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol#Industrial_production ) Specificly D3- Often made from lanolin, a byproduct oil from sheep's wool. There are vegetarian friendly sources, especially in products like Silk soy milk. This ingredient is more of an issue for vegans.

[DATEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DATEM )- You know it's questionable when the word is all capitol letters. DATEM is one of those things that could very well be vegetarian (soy), but it's impossible to be sure without looking into its source, as it is essentially a variety of glycerin.

[L-cysteine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cysteine#Industrial_sources )- Very often found in bread, flour tortillas, and similar products, it's basically processed duck feathers (although it's actually been made from human hair too). Oddly enough, it's apparently good for hangovers.

[Magnesium Stearate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_stearate )- This is going to be one of the big ones for a lot of people. Chances are everyone reading this has some Magnesium Stearate laying around and they don't even know it. Do you take medicine? Then you're probably ingesting this product. It's in most tablets. Yum. Also, if you see variations of “stearate”, they're related, such as Staeric acid and [Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_stearoyl_lactylate#Food_applications_and_maximum_use_levels ), which is itself found in a lot of stuff such as pudding and baked goods.

[Lipase](http://curd-nerd.com/lipase-what-is/)- is an enzyme used in cheese making. It's present in milk naturally, but the enzyme is harvested much like rennet and added to milk during the process. It's not added to all cheeses and has vegetarian sources also, which are often used.

[Castoreum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castoreum#Food_use)- You'll have to wonder how this one even started. Castoreum is a chemical used by Beavers to mark their territories. It's used as a food additive and one of those mysterious ""Natural Flavors"". It's use is not huge, but it happens. It's actually used for sweet flavored stuff such as vanilla. You may not even know it's there as it's used in both alcohol and cigarettes, which of course don't label like foods. 

[Cochineal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal#Uses)- Food coloring made from bugs. It's used as a dye for a LOT of different things and is fairly common.

[Shellac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellac)- is a bug secretion used to not only make your furniture shiney, but your food too.

Natural and Artificial Flavors. For vegetarians, this is a way for companies to screw us over with their super secret proprietary information. If it's legally safe to consume, manufacturers can use this very vague term to put anything in their product without actually saying what it is. For instance, Doritos and Cheetos use either pork or chicken flavoring. Personally, I just use common sense when deciding what to eat with natural flavorings in it. For instance, if it's a chocolate bar, you're probably okay.

Many beers and wines contain animal products, either for flavor or [processing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finings). And for whatever reason these companies are exempt from laws regarding ingredient listing. A by the brand guide can be found at [this easy to use site](http://www.barnivore.com/).

Not specific to what's in the food, but as to how it's prepared- Restaurants...being a vegetarian for over a decade and a half now, I've taught myself how to cook, so it was only natural that while I was in college I started cooking in restaurants. Eventually I was doing it full time and managing a restaurant. I spent years in commercial kitchens. I can tell you that if you're the least bit picky about your food and how it's prepared, either stick to vegetarian restaurants or cook for yourself (which I think most people should be doing more of anyway). The truth is if there is meat being prepared in the kitchen, your food probably isn't as vegetarian as you'd like. Grills, fryers, and other cooking areas are used for everyone's food. Your fries are probably being dropped in the fryer with chicken, your veggie quesadilla is covered in meat grease from the flat-top, and your sandwiches were possibly cut with the same knife used to cut someone else's ham sandwich. It sucks, but that's the truth of eating at a lot of restaurants. I know some people don't necessarily care too much about this, but thought enough do that I should say something. 

I didn't plan this out before I started typing it up, so I'm certain I'm forgetting some things. I'd be happy to hear some more ingredients I've forgotten, so just let me know and I'll add them to the list.

I see people wondering about rennet a lot. Sargento cheeses are usually safe. The few that aren't are listed on their [FAQ page](http://www.sargento.com/our-company/faq/ ). A summary on rennet for those who don't know- Rennet or Rennin is an enzyme used to coagulate milk to form cheese. While the name can occasionally be applied to a non-animal sourced enzyme, this typically isn't the case. The enzyme comes from the stomach of calves, who produce it in order to digest their mother's milk. Most traditionally made cheeses use rennet, especially hard cheeses. The unfortunate situation is that almost all manufacturers list the vague ingredient of ""enzymes"" on their packaging. Some cheeses specify that they are vegetarian friendly, and there are certain varieties of soft cheeses that also tend to be less likely to use rennet such as cottage cheese or Mascarpone.

This isn't meant to offend but is a desire to be educated. My family has a hay farm in MT, USA and the only beef I eat is from the cows my family has to put down. Fortunately, it happens infrequently and there is so much beef on one cow that it suffices for a very long time (when frozen). So my open question is this: what objections are there to that form of meat eating? Is it the act of killing the animal for my personal gain that is an issue? I don't have any vegetarian friends and I want to get a charitable understanding of the ethical motivation behind being a vegetarian and what differentiates the ""moral code"" of a vegetarian from that of a a vegan. 
Any input is greatly appreciated.

[The Buffalo Cauliflower Wings from PETA's website](http://www.peta.org/living/vegetarian-living/spicy-buffalo-cauliflower-wings.aspx)

I did things a little bit differently after reading the reviews, and as a former meat eater that only missed chicken wings, these are a decent substitute.

Instead of baking them for 18 minutes before adding the sauce, I baked them for about 15, then I deep fried them for about 30-45 seconds, until golden brown. One of the reviews said they weren't crispy from just baking them.

When I was mixing my buffalo sauce, I did that a bit differently, too, since I'm a weakling when it comes to spice, (thanks acid reflux!)

I did about 1/4 cup (at most) of Franks Red Hot, then about 1/2 BBQ sauce, and I did 2 tbsp of veg oil instead of one, since I had less sauce.

Poured that over the deep fried cauliflower, and baked it for about another 5 minutes, and enjoyed it with some ranch dressing.

I highly recommend this recipe, it was tasty, and tender, and easy.

When I was mixing the flour and water together, and dipping my cauliflower I'll admit I was nervous. It looked like pancake batter that I was submerging my veggies in, and I didn't know how it would turn out in the baking.

Also, they don't mention it in on the website, but I lined my pan with aluminum foil, and sprayed it with non-stick spray. (I'm very glad I did that, because a couple of them still tried to stick!)

1343235020.0,89,self.vegetarian,x500q,The labelling and judgement of vegatarians/vegans/flexitarians/etc. are alienating and detrimental to the lifestyle.,Arkaic,127,38,203,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/x500q/the_labelling_and_judgement_of/,"I'm talking about the incredible nitpickiness and moral standards I've encountered both online and out in the wild from ""vegetarians"" and the like.


I came to my current diet because I was increasingly disinterested in meat and wanted to eat healthier, more nutritious food. I wasn't particularly interested in the moral aspects of my diet, but didn't hold it against anyone for believing otherwise. They're entitled to their beliefs and I find it admirable that they're passionate about what they believe in. So when I started investigating vegetarian communities, I was overwhelmed by the sheer amount of exclusion that occurs between vegetarians, especially in all the different labels. You eat a fish once? Banished to pescetarianism. Like dairy and eggs on occasion? Octo-Lavo. This culture of ultra-specific labeling, from at least my experience, creates a sort of pressure to adhere to a strict moral code for your diet. People will tell you you're not X because of Y. Your diet is judged, even if they're not trying to be negative or insulting. Combine this with the fact that all of a sudden, you're exposed to a multitude of moral conflicts even within your vegetarian sub-group. Dealing with issues like rennet in cheese or fish bladder in beer, it only becomes more difficult to maintain your ""label"", both on a personal and social level.


After all of this, so many other vegetarians introduce political and moral issues into the mix: from fish farming to mistreatment of dairy cows to leather, even your diet-label is subject to debate. Now your diet is wrung up in political, ethical, and social questions.


This isn't necessarily bad, as consciousness of your diet and lifestyle is always a good thing. What is bad, though, is how alienating all of this is to someone who is just starting to explore vegetarianism. If you're not prepared for this kind of consciousness, or are dismayed by the politics involved, you're much more likely to give up. And then rather than having someone who maybe could have been eating vegetarian 75% of the time, they're back to regularly eating meat and meat-by-products (not to mention the influence spite can have after being disillusioned; enough people hate vegetarians as it is). So you're left with an insular community whose very exclusive nature is causing potential vegetarians to be turned away, which only takes away from the goal of trying to get more people to have healthier vegetarian eating habits!


I mean, just from my own experience, I've felt increasingly disconnected here when I see topics like these so upvoted (and comments about not wanting be moral about it downvoted):

http://www.reddit.com/tb/wg0f5

http://www.reddit.com/tb/wmk9x



And even moreso when I go to a local vegetarian group who starts spewing local politics and selling artwork like this:
http://willtuttle.com/16.htm

I've gotten to the point where I don't even want to call myself a vegetarian, if only to avoid the loaded connotations and associations that come with the label, both inside and outside of the community.

**SORT OF TL;DR** As a community, we should emphasize that vegetarian living is a lifestyle and an approach to diet, and doesn't always need to carry the added burden of morality and politics. We need to be less concerned with defining and adhering to dietary labels and more concerned with providing people with lifestyle approaches that can range in terms of commitment. If we don't, we'll continue to be alienating and will only hurt vegetarianism as a whole.

I, for one, love Taco Bell (along with my fellow Veggie friends at home) and other fast foods, but thankfully I'm forcing most of that out of my diet. I'm an employee at Taco Bell and I've taken advantage of getting to know the menu to come up with different vegetarian strategies.

**Note** *You're honestly taking a risk with your food coming in contact with meat products at Taco Bell. They generally put the tortilla onto a wrapper and slide it down, but on the way they may neglect using a wrapper until it gets down the line. I usually pick around meat if I have to, but will try to avoid any trace of it if I can. If you tell them you want to make sure it doesn't come in contact with meat, using an allergy excuse should work to let the employees know to change their gloves and take extra precautions.*

**We have found out that the refried beans are vegetarian, but the sour cream contains gelatin.**

A lot of the meat can be substituted with potato chunks which are quite tasty. Sometimes beans can also replace it, or it may even be ommitted.

Also, not that going here to eat healthily makes any sense, but you can always try out the ""fresco"" versions of what they make which usually adds their version of pico de gallo and contains no dairy products. It's pretty delicious nonetheless.

**Current ♥ Special**

*Beefy Crunch Burrito* (nacho cheese, spicy fritos, rice, ~~sour cream~~, ~~beef~~ ⇒ potatoes)
I highly recommend this. It's my favourite.

**Naturally Vegetarian Menu Items**

*Potato Taco* (potato chunks, pepper jack sauce, lettuce, cheese)

*Cheesy Nachos* [These are wonderful to just add rice, beans, ~~sour cream~~, tomatoes, jalapeños]

*7-Layer Burrito* (rice, beans, 3-cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, ~~sour cream~~, guacamole)

*Bean Burrito* (beans, cheddar cheese, onions, red sauce)

*Cheesey Roll-Up* (3-cheese)

*Cheese Quesadilla* (3-cheese, jalapeño sauce)

*Cinnamon Twists*

*Caramel Apple Empanadas*

*Pinto Beans and Cheese* (pinto beans, red sauce, 3-cheese)

*Rice*

*Cheesy Fiesta Potatoes* (potato chunks, nacho cheese, ~~sour cream~~)

*Tostada* (flat hard shell with beans, red sauce, lettuce, cheddar cheese)

**Modifiable Options**

I've seen regular *tacos* be made with *beans* instead of meat. It didn't really look appetising to me, but it could work. *(I can't knock it without trying it though!)*

I'd recommend taking any *burrito* you think looks good and trying it using potatoes. However, if no potatoes are prepared at the time you order it, they may add 3 minutes to your wait if they have to drop them in the deep fryer.

*Salads* are obvious choices you can get without meat instead, but... ew. Those are not salads. Just make sure you ask for no *meat* and no *sour cream*.

You have *chalupas*, which are deep fried *gorditas* which are round *flatbreads*.

*Crunchwrap Supremes* are delicious without meat in general, and I've heard it's great with beans. Same thing with *Mexican pizzas*.

**Pro-tip**: Baja Blast Mountain Dew is just Mountain Dew with blue Powerade. :) I hate having to tell people that we don't have it at our location.


*  The full menu is also at [Taco Bell's website](http://www.tacobell.com/).

I'm a student from across the pond (Denmark) and every night at 10:25 PM I go out on my bike with lots of bags and take food that the supermarkets throw out. This way I get free (often organic) food. Usually it has exceeded the expiration date but sometimes it gets thrown out because one fruit has a dent or there is a hole in the bag. I've been doing it for two months and I've never had better food in my life. Things I get on an almost daily basis: Organic rye bread, bananas, all kinds of fruit, all kinds of vegetables (avocado, leek,tomatoes, red bell peppers, broccoli, carrots - everything you would ever want). In addition I sometimes get socks, balsamic vinegar, beers, wine, rice, lentils, chickpeas, pasta, soft drinks - the list could go on forever.

In Denmark, you disclaim ownership when throwing items in a garbage bin that is publicly available. What I do is therefore perfectly legal, and it helps me reduce my waste to almost zero. The common Dane produces 1500 kg of waste every year, and since I almost never buy anything, my waste-contribution is almost nonexistent. In addition I almost live for free. 
Yesterday I had a couchsurfer in my house (I live for rent with 2 guys and my girlfriend) and he went with me on my garbage treasure hunt - he was amazed and wants to do the same when he returns to New York. In one of the containers, we found a whole box of quality bacon - around7-8 kg. 

I called some friends and gave them some, but brought home quite a bit. This morning we cooked a great breakfast with scrambled eggs, baked beans, mushrooms and bacon. I gladly ate the bacon even though I never eat meat, because from my point of view it would be a terrible waste for the pig to have suffered and died for less reason (if that reason is to feed us, which I don't exactly believe). All the energy that has been put into raising the pig, feeding it and transporting and packaging it would have been completely wasted. And as you might realise, I hate waste.

My couchsurfer is a vegan and did not have any - which I obviously have no problem with.
But how about you? What kind of vegetarian are you and what is your view on this?

I'm a 28 year old male from Canada originally and I've been a vegetarian for more than a decade. In that time, I've eaten meat or fish a few times by complete accident (living in East Asia doesn't help) but I've mostly been great about it. I grew up in Canada and knew very few vegetarians in my life and am always surrounded by meat eaters. I never advertise it so people generally don't know/care about it unless we're at a restaurant. 

My girlfriend is a Korean vegetarian/near-vegan and we cook together. Sometimes we use Facebook to connect with other vegans/vegetarians in our city (Seoul). Usually the group that comes out is a mix of Canadians, Americans, Australians, and some Europeans. 

Anyway, I find most of them really don't like me. I'm a really friendly guy and usually get along with everybody (who isn't nuts) but when I find vegetarians as a whole to be really difficult people to be friendly with. First of all, they're so picky. I know being picky about food comes with the territory but I find it goes beyond that; they're picky about how people around them conduct themselves, other people's political views, tastes in music... everything. They all have the same style, same beliefs and similar personalities. A lot of them seem dainty and stuck up to me (not to be harsh). Also, my personality is very eclectic in that I like a wide variety of things that very occasionally conflict in some superficially silly way.  

Because of this, I've been told by these people (directly and indirectly) that ""you don't seem like a vegetarian"" about a thousand times. One guy always forgets that I'm a vegetarian, almost on purpose, and keeps acting surprised every time it comes up (and I've been a vegetarian for a lot longer than most of them). He actually said: ""I heard you became a vegetarian! Good for you!"" To which I replied: ""...and I've been one for more than a decade."" 

Overall, I find that when I go meet other vegetarians/vegans, they're always sizing each other up and trying to outdo each other. They call each other out on not being vegetarian enough, and they politely told a couple to quit the group because they ate fish. They've also decided to disallow meat eaters joining in the meeting, which meant I was messaged and told not to come after I clicked ""attend"" on Facebook (because the leader is the guy who keeps forgetting I'm a vegetarian). 

So yeah, I don't like most vegetarians. I've gone to this group a dozen times, met about thirty or forty of them and I find they're doing it for the wrong reasons and care more about their image than they do about animals. Especially the ones that are under 25 (I do know some awesome vegetarians that seem to have ""grown up""). 

I'm a vegetarian because I like animals a lot and I think factory farms are sick, it's really not that complicated. I also never preach it. I just really hate how these vegetarians must be the reason why PETA exists, and why meat eaters tend to feel so put off by vegetarianism. 

Actually, I said ""I don't want to force people to be vegetarians, I just want people to eat less meat and think more about where it comes from"" which was blasphemy in the group and I felt waves of hatred for awhile after I said that.

I like to try to eat healthy as much as I can and every once in awhile I'll end up eating a vegetarian meal.  Today I found out there is a tiny vegetarian/vegan mexican bistro half a block from my work hidden away in a loft.  It turns out they had 50 cent tacos from 5-8 last night so I figured why not try them.

I got two for myself as I figured they'd be small and I bought two extra in case anyone back at work wanted them.  When I took them back a couple girls at work had already gotten three each and seemed to be enjoying them so I was excited to go try mine out and share the other two.  When I got back to the guys, all four of them were completely disgusted when they found out the tacos were vegetarian.  

Apparently they thought the whole time that these would have meat in them and just the absence of it made them not want any part of these.  One guy even tried a bite and acted like he was about to throw up and threw it in the trash.  Another guy even called me ""unamerican"" because I don't smoke cigarettes like the rest of them and was eating a vegetarian meal.  As a non-vegetarian I thought this was really weird behavior but I just told them they're missing out and enjoyed a very tasty meal.

Anyway, this was just my experience of one time eating vegetarian in front of some friends.  All of them seemed to think it was incredibly gross and just made jokes about my manhood and other such things for eating it.  Do you guys ever have experiences like this?

My roommate can't cook, and as a result ends up eating mainly noodles. I can cook, but I don't know the good foundations for a vegetarian meal, so I don't know where to start. I'd like to have some time to work on my vegetarian cooking skills, so I'm not stuck using my roommate as a guinea pig.

I want to be able to eat the same meals as him without having to eat noodles on noodles, and without having to make two separate dishes so as to keep one vegetarian.

The house will have three meat-heavy omnivores and the one vegetarian, so if you know of dishes that can act as a good bridge between the two, that would be appreciated, but I'm mainly just looking for meals in general.

**EDIT:** Thanks for all your help, guys! I'll start with what you've given me here, and try to use those as a springboard to doing more on my own.

I had been thinking about it since middle school but never actually did it because my family can be closed-minded and judgmental, but I was dating this guy who had been vegetarian for a long time and he helped me make the plunge.

I thought I might go back after a while, but I didn't and I don't think I ever will. When I have good vegetarian food, it's always been light years ahead of any meat-based meal I ever had, and I'm a major foodie. I've also overcome many negative eating habits, because being in control of my diet means that I'm in control of what I eat and how I perceive food. Food used to control me, now I control it.

Not only that, but as someone who used to love meat and steak, I find myself grossed out by meat now. Meat dishes no longer look or smell appetizing. It's hunks of flesh on a plate - gross. It's slimy and chewy and weird. Vegetarian food is so full of amazing textures and flavors. Honestly, I'm amazed. I never thought my experience would be like this, so positive.

I just thought I would share since I'm so happy I made the decision to stop eating meat. My next step is trying to go vegan once I move to a place that has a kitchen - I'm living in a dorm now and we don't even have a community kitchen. Regardless, I'm so much happier now.

It was 5 o'clock in the morning and I was at home doing an all nighter to finish an assignment. think I hear a cat fight so I take my headphones out and listen trying to make out the noise?? Then I realise it's the chickens going crazy they are being attacked by a fox! I run put on my shoes grab my torch shout out to my bf who went back to sleep and ran out the the front garden. My torch is shit but I could still hear the chickens going mad!! Then I see the feathers everywhere. I do my special call ""chicky chick chick chick"" that let's them know its me. The fox has got in through a tiny gap and pushed wire out of the way I've left the ladder down its my fault!! Still I hear chickens and follow the trail of feathers, Ziggy (my cat) hot on my heels. Then suddenly out of nowhere Marjorie the chicken comes out of the Forrest towards me. She's in bad shape but I can't tell how bad. I pick her up and run to the house to inspect. She's list all her tail feathers and is bleeding I eventually find a small wound on her bottom it's a tooth mark but no too bad. I stroke her and sing to her for 5 mins to calm her down. I leave her in the kitchen to go and see how many I've got left. We have 4 including Marj. I take the front of the hutch I can only see one chicken (Belina)!! Oh no!! Then I look closer and shoved in the ends when they lay eggs are Fliza and Meryl!! Thank goodness they are all okay. I go back to collect Marjorie to put her back I secure them all up and check all the locks. I knew something profound had happened to me that night as when I play back the moment I saw Marjorie running towards me out of the Forrest it's always in slow motion with that suddenly I see her song playing. I knew I never wanted to eat chicken or meat again I love them so much. Majorie is truly British though as she still laid her 2 eggs as usual this morning and said she's not going to let that stop her. She said she's maintains a a stiff upper beak.

I just thought that we as humans have little need to kill animals simply because we like the taste of their flesh.

Eventually, I had to tell my mum. She was surprised and seems convinced to keep me eating meat. I'm not sure why. Her main arguments are that I'm a growing boy (15) and need protein and that she won't let me cook veggie meals for myself.

Well today as we are setting the table, I notice something different, my mom made vegetarian ham rollups. Instead of wrapping the pickle and cream cheese spread in ham, she wrapped them in a spinach leaf. They tasted so good, even some of my meat eating family were snacking on them, I actually had to make sure I got some because the regular ham rollups were being ignored.

I was ten years old and in 5th grade (year 6).

I had social studies class right before lunch. Our teacher was the kind who loved to disgust us: he frequently told us how many insect pieces or rat hairs could be found in snack foods, peanut butter, canned fruit, and tobacco products.

That September, he chose to explain the production process of hot dogs, natural casings, headcheese, and the general meat processing industry. We got out of class and went to lunch, where, by chance, hot dogs were on the menu. I was so grossed out that I (admittedly) overreacted and told everyone that I was going vegetarian immediately.

Today, I am in my Junior year of college, 20 years old, and I haven't eaten meat since. I've officially been a vegetarian for over half of my life.

For those thinking about going vegetarian: try it. It's a good lifestyle choice with (as you can see) a great community.
For those who say ""I could *never* be a vegetarian:"" you can. Take things one step at a time. All you need is a little willpower.

2 large sweet potatoes, cut in small chunks (leave the skin on for more texture and nutrition)

2 med/large onions, chopped

2 quarts vegi stock

1 tbsp olive oil (to saute onions)

1 1/2 cups dried lentils (I used brown)

2 cups water

1/2 cup unsweetened coconut flakes

1 tbsp garam masala (sweeter) and/or madras curry powder (spicier) (i used some of both)

1 tsp cayenne 

salt to taste

In a large pot, saute onions with olive oil until translucent.  Add everything else. Bring to boil.  Reduce heat to medium/low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes (until lentils are very tender; if you use red or black lentils this will be 20-30 minutes).  If you have a hand blender (highly recommend), blend until smooth.  If using regular blender, blend in a few batches and transfer to another bowl/pot.  This made 4-5 quarts of soup, so plenty of leftovers.

But when I looked the amount of protein compared to other sources, there doesn't seem to be as much as I thought there was.  In particular, my quinoa has 6 grams of protein in a 172 calorie serving, while my english muffins have 7 grams of protein in a 130 calorie serving.  In addition, my whole wheat bread has 5 grams of protein in a 100 calorie serving, and my whole wheat pasta has 8 grams of protein in a 210 calorie serving, which also seem pretty comparable.

So I was just wondering what the big fuss is about quinoa in particular?  The biggest reason I can think of is that quinoa is a complete protein, while whole wheat is not.

I take iron supplements regularly and have a very balanced diet of legumes fruit, vegetables, carbs (although sometimes I eat too many carbs) and minimal amounts of dairy due to small issues with lactose. I don't eat eggs unless they are mixed into cakes and the like because the taste makes me hurl so I avoid them. People seem to feel the need to comment on my diet and even my boyfriend worries I'm not getting enough protein or iron and I know he does it out of love for me and it's the same with my mother who has always supported my diet and never forced the point but still thinks eating a little would be good for me but I'm sick of it. I know my body better than anyone else, my Dr tells me I'm healthy, I don't do drugs, I don't drink. I get tired sometimes but other than that I'm perfectly healthy and within a normal weight range for my hight and age.

Not promoting cruelty, health, and environmental being chief among them.

Factory farmed meat, and most meat for that matter, violates at least one of these.

But I was sitting thinking about it, and realized that some meat seems to be free of all three of these black marks.

In Australia here, rabbits are an introduced, invasive species that cause a lot of environmental damage and drive out native species.

They are hunted actively, and I have heard that often the carcasses are simply thrown away because it's not worth doing anything with them. 

So, points one and three are not valid here. 

Finally, I really believe that the great problem with most media is the farming methods, letting them rot in a tiny cell and stuffing them full of corn byproducts and antibiotics. How healthful is the meat going to be? But a rabbit that has run free its whole life eating plants is going to be entirely different.

So, I finally brought this idea into reality, went to the farmer's market and bought a wild rabbit, and boiled it up with onion, garlic, and rosemary. You know what? It's pretty dang good.

Even though I am no longer technically a vegetarian, I would still steer far clear of 99% of meat out there.

So, that's my story, typing on /r/vegetarian while eating some rabbit soup.

Of course the first things I did was search for vegetarians in Japan. From the few things I did read, it seems like it's really hard to be vegetarian in Japan. I guess they put fish in almost everything. Bonito/fish (sp?) flakes, are used in a lot of foods, and when asking for non meat cuisine, they don't consider fish to be meat. It's one thing to be a resident of the land and know the area, and being able to find local places that will cater to our diet, but traveling is always so fast paced, and you never know what to expect, so this concerns me.

The main reason why I became a vegetarian is because of the US's factory farming. I initially started as a veg that would still consider (in extreme dire situations) eating meat if it was properly raised. After more research, I also included health into my reasons, and ruled out ever eating meat, properly raised or not. This was until my thoughts on traveling came about. I still don't believe I would eat any meat, but it would be hard to avoid fish stock or something like that. 

I'm a bit torn thinking about this subject. I could go on forever back and forth in my head. So I turn to you guys, maybe you guys can share some experiences on traveling and being a vegetarian/vegan. If you've ever made exceptions, or made sacrifices, whatever that may mean to you.

I'm still such a Reddit newb, but I've been trying to get a little more involved in the various subreddits. And it just occurred to me that if anyone was going to care about/understand my 10th anniversary as a vegetarian, it might be you guys. So... here I be. :) January 2013 marks 10 years of strict ovo-lacto vegetarianism with no conscious-and-willing slips (there's been the odd moment of biting into something someone told me was veggie-friendly &amp; finding out it wasn't... blech). And the occasional vegan day.

Unfortunately, I caught a nasty sinus cold or something a few days before NYE, and I haven't kicked it yet. So I haven't really felt up to cooking a big celebratory meal or making any kind of fuss, but at the same time... well, I'm kind proud of myself, I guess? Took me a few years to go properly veg in the first place, and it's always been a really important step for me - I'm a crazy animal lover, and really want to make a difference in protecting the planet and my own health, too! So,  I dunno... 10 years veg (in a mostly meat-centric culture) isn't something to shrug at.

It's definitely meant a whole new way of shopping and eating and going out... takes a little more effort, a little more thought. But it all kinda becomes second nature after a bit, and hey, I still manage to try as many 'local delicacies' and such when travelling as I ever did before, if not more - veggie haggis ain't bad! ;) I've even taken to getting creative in the kitchen at home, trying new cuisines from all over the world. I think the 'restriction' has, perhaps, broadened my culinary horizons far more than it's hindered them. :)

Anyway, just wanted to share my happy moment. And maybe give some encouragement to any newer veggies out there? It gets easier the longer you do it, I promise. :) And never be afraid to try new things. Since becoming veg, I've fallen in love with Indian, Japanese, Thai, Morrocan, and east African cuisines. I've discovered new squashes and beans and greens and fruit I'd never tried before. I've fallen in love with coconut &amp; almond milks. I recently made my very first Tofurkey roast and impressed the heck out of myself (add red wine to the baste)! There's a very big world of flavours and possibilities, and no need to kill a fellow animal in order to enjoy the hell out of it. :D",,False,,t5_2qm7x,False,,,True,t3_165m44,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/165m44/10_years_veggie/,

They were more than obliging to do so, but warned me that due to the grill taking slightly longer to heat up that there would be a bit of a wait. 

At this point someone must have been poking the lady behind me with a very sharp stick, for a very long time because she quipped (NB this lady reasonably ""big boned""):  

""Urgh, why should I have to wait longer just because you are fussy?!"" (She didn't have to wait any longer, I did)

To which I replied, from here on ""R"" for Rimmington and ""L"" for Lady:

R: ""I'm sorry, I'm a vegetarian so I prefer to have my food cooked using items that haven't touched meat.""  

L: ""Oh so you don't eat meat?!""  

R: ""No I don't, or fish either.""  

L: ""So nothing, no steak or chicken?""  

R: ""That's right.""  

L: ""And because of YOUR choice I have to wait longer?""  

R: ""Well you don't bu-""  

L: ""*Why* should I wait for you, just because you don't eat normally?You're so thin and scrawny; I bet thats because you don't eat meat eh!""

After hearing this, the woman in front of me, obviously tired of this other lady's bullshit, turns around and just says 

""It probably is; it looks like you should try it.""

Angry chubby lady's face falls, I laugh, and justice through embarrassment prevails. Thank you mystery cafe woman, for making my day. 

P.S. I'm not saying its ""cool"" to laugh at a larger person, but that this situation shows that not everyone will stand there and ask ""OMG *why* wouldn't you want to eat meat?!"", and that there are some non-judgemental people out there.

I've been a vegetarian for 4 weeks.,furmat60,55,5,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/126hux/hello_new_to_this_subreddit_ive_been_a_vegetarian/,"I started dating my girlfriend back in July, and she was a vegetarian when I met her. In September, she went Vegan. When she became vegan, I told her I would go vegetarian for 2 weeks to see if I could do it. It was hard, I'll admit it. It was really hard. But I got used to it at the end of the two weeks. I noticed how good I felt and I even lost some weight (which is fantastic.) I went back to eating meat, and didn't think anything of it. Then, my girlfriend asked me if I'd want to go vegetarian for Vegetarian Awareness Month. She said her best friend was also doing it, and me wanting to be a supporting boyfriend, I agreed. Here it is 4 weeks into it, and I feel amazing. Before this started, I had major sleep issues. If I could even manage to fall asleep, I'd wake up at least 4 times a night. I felt sluggish and I had no energy. This past week was the best week of sleep I've got in 3 years. I have so much energy. I've lost nearly 30 pounds since the beginning of September and I feel incredible. I've got another 22 pounds to lose and I'll be at 200, which is where I want to be (I'm a big guy, a lot of muscle) I watched Forks over Knives yesterday, and that is what truly decided for me to go vegetarian. While I don't like how animals are treated, my decision is based on health reasons. I'm already lactose intolerant and the only dairy I had not given up was cheese. I gave up cheese 2 days ago after I experienced stomach cramps so bad I had to pull over while I was driving on the freeway. After being presented with everything since I've been with my girlfriend, I've come to the conclusion that you DO NOT need meat. Tons of athletes out there confirm this.  I can't wait to get to maximum health, and I hope I enjoy this subreddit!

It's cheap. It's high in protein, AND it's high in fiber. I prepare it and surprise meat-eaters with the texture.

r/vegetarian, here is where I get my TVP: http://www.healthy-eating.com/category/Unflavored_Textured_Soy I have bought from them for going on a decade now.

They are cheap, and because the stuff is dehydrated, a 5lb bag is TONS of food, lasts my family a year (oc, we always buy three varieties of unflavored: ground, chunk, and strips).

Here is the key: when you rehydrate, flavor your rehydrating broth to be a version of what you want the TVP to taste like.  I simply heat my TVP and rehydrating broth together until the TVP has absorbed all the broth or the broth has cooked off.I have a variety of hydration broths I use to attain various meat-like experiences.

For instance, I use chunks rehydrated with a mix of mostly water, some sugar, soy sauce, vegetable oil, and liquid smoke to get porky chunks for sweet and sour pork. This is the fattiest meat, so I add more oil to porkish TVP.

I rehydrate with water, a bit of soy sauce, oil, and poultry seasonings for a poultry-like flavor, good for stir fries. Far less oil for poultry-like.

For beef, I rehydrate with a mix of water, red wine, soy sauce, browning sauce, oil, and paprika, and I get a good beefish TVP that makes excellent sizzling beef (more oil) or a ground beef replacement (less oil) using the crumble.

Just thought I'd share since you guys and gals are all so awesome. I do feel giving the TVP some fat in rehydration is essential. Fat tastes good, and TVP is utterly lean without some added.

edit: I'd be glad to field any questions on this topic; also, I'm not affiliated with the linked business at all, just appreciate the food that I can buy from them, the deal it feels like, and I thought r/vegetarian would appreciate it as much as I do.",,False,,t5_2qm7x,True,,,True,t3_quqgm,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/quqgm/texture_soy_protein_textured_vegetable_protein/,

I mean, seriously.  Despite my best efforts, on my vacation this past week I ended up eating dairy and eggs several times.  (*How was I supposed to know that your Italian salad dressing contains cheese and eggs?!  I mean, Italian dressing doesn't usually contain these things, and it certainly doesn't have to.*)  I even researched food in advance, and I still wasn't able to obtain all the information I needed.  I was led to some sites that contained the contents of letters vegans/vegetarians had received in response to their inquiries, and repeatedly it was like, ""We don't know what's in our food.""  Seriously?  How do you not know?  You're responsible for writing the recipes.  You are accountable for how the food is prepared.  I mean, okay, I get that waiters and waitresses generally don't know anything.  I'll even let managers slide a little.  Getting a little bacon in my rice... okay.  Heck, even serving me mayo and cheese on my sandwich wrap after I asked you *twice* not to is one thing.  But the corporate offices of restaurant chains should have the nutritional information of their food ready and posted on the Internet and/or in their restaurants.  Because, honestly, this makes me not want to go out to mainstream restaurants--how can I be sure my food is the way I need it to be?!  And frankly, with the growing number of vegetarians in this country (20% of college students allegedly call themselves vegetarian), you'd think this would be something restaurants care about.  And then, of course, there's all the people with other dietary restrictions, and more importantly than any of us limited foodies, people with allergies.  Not having basic information like ingredients lists is dangerous.

Fake burgers, bacon, hot dogs, etc. just leave me disenchanted and I'd rather just have the real thing. However, when veggies are prepared in creative and flavorful ways, you never need to try to emulate meat. 

Things like Tofurky, Quorn, Boca Burgers, etc. are kind of like listening to a bad midi track instead of the real song. Or playing Guitar Hero instead of guitar. Or banging a blow up doll.

**A bit of backstory:**  I grew up with Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese and hot dogs, and fish sticks and mashed potatoes being on the weekly menu.  Oh, and Hamburger Helper.  Canned corn was pretty much the only veggie we ate.  Also, I live in an area with very limited availability for good, fresh produce.

**The Obstacles:**  

* I have little to no cooking skills.  

* I have little to no understanding of how to select, prepare, and cook different vegetables (or other healthy foods)

* I need to avoid dairy and soy

* I have a family of 5, with very tight budget, so I can afford to take any risks.

* I need mild flavors, because I've been labeled as a ""super taster"" (a person who experiences the sense of taste with far greater intensity than average)

**The Questions:**

* Do you know of any good resources for people like me?
* Do you have any advice/tips?
* I want to start eating beans, but the only kind I'm familiar with are canned baked beans.  Can you recommend a mild flavored bean for me to try?",,False,,t5_2qm7x,False,,,True,t3_1bcwlk,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/1bcwlk/can_you_help_me_i_am_fat_and_i_dont_like_the/,

My thoughts:  The problem with this is that it assumes that, as a result of going vegetarian, people go out and start consuming lots of eggs/dairy to compensate for not eating meat.  But... well, I guess I can't speak for everyone, but my egg and dairy consumption did not measurably increase when I became vegetarian.  My soy, grain, and bean consumption did, and I still ate dairy and eggs, but no more than anyone else around me.  So even if the author's math is right--and I'm not saying anything on that one way or the other--I'm thinking one would have to be a pretty **a**typical vegetarian for his or her diet to kill more animals than an omnivorous one.

I had read that the results can be fast, but didn't really believe it until I tried it, and thanks to the good advice in this sub, it was a lot easier than I thought it would be.

I wasn't grossly overweight to begin with (about 240 lbs at 6'5""), but I knew I could stand to lose a few pounds. I was eating a pretty typical American diet: fast food once per week, restaurants twice per week, meat with two meals most days, three to four servings of fruit and veggies per day.

I don't have a scale, but it's pretty clear that going meatless and cutting back on cheese and dairy (although not fully eliminating them...yet) has made a huge difference. I feel better, my pants are starting to get much looser, I'm on a belt loop I haven't used in 5 years, and when I do eat out, I pick healthier options than I would have before.

So, I just wanted to share my story so far and say thank you to this subreddit for helping me get started.

Box of Vital Wheat Gluten (VWG) - Wegmans and Coop
Garbanzo bean flour (chic pea flour) - coop only
Braggs Amino Acids - coop (it's like a soy sauce substitute but better than soy sauce)
Veg bullion cubes (about 4) -Wegmans coop
Veg stock - Wegmans coop
A-1 or other steak flavor (I use franks hot sauce!!)
OPTIONAL:
Liquid smoke - Wegmans (small bottle)
Any seasoning like Hamburger rub or bacon salt

Directions 
Mix the full box of VWG with 1/4 cup chic pea flour. Mix well with dry hands. (Add seasoning if you want)

Separate bowl mix: 1 1/4 cup veg stock; 1/2 cup braggs amino acids, 1/4 hot sauce/ a-1 sauce; FEW dashes of smoke flavor. Stir that shit up. 

Boil 8 cups water in the largest pot you have, add the six bullion cubes. Bring to a boil. Maybe do this step first. 

Mix the flours and the liquid together and kneed with your hands. It gets REAL doughy quick so work fast. Don't add all the liquid at first. Add more if its dry. I usually have less tha 1/4 cup left. KNEED FOR FIVE MINUTES. one big ball.

Sit the big ball into four parts. The try to flatten each quarter. I stretch, pull, punch, use a rolling pin to do this. Once you have all four as flat as possible, let sit for five minutes. 

Come back, chop up the patties into bite size pieces. Work fast here. The water is boiling and the Seitan needs to get in there! Get all the pieces in, stirring as you do so. Cover, reduce to a slow simmer. Come back in 1/2 hour to stir. Walk away. Come back in 45, stir and then drain into strainer. Let sit for five minutes to drain. 

Pre-heat oven to 325-350. Spray pan with non stick spray. Lay out all the seitan pieces. BAKE! For about 15 min, flip them, cook another 15min, or until they are just starting to brown. Take them out. 

There yeah go! From here the possibilities are endless. BBQ sandwich, fried hot seitan wings, eat it with eggs, or alone as a snack. 

Honestly, this is my jam. HIGH LIEN protein and cheap.

Our ancestors' large canines were primarily used to bite fruits, not meat, and then canine size shrunk as large back teeth for chewing tough vegetation appeared.  Then back teeth shrunk again in response to tool advancement, which allowed us to better crush/pulp our food (plant and animal alike) and so reduced chewing demand and actually made it less advantageous to have large back teeth.  (Source:  My Anthro 101 textbook)

In other words, our canines have very little, if anything, to do with our omnivorousness, as I understand it.  (Please correct me if I'm wrong; I've only read a little on the subject.)  So, even if it were the case that natural=right/good, the state of our canines isn't particularly relevant to our natural omnivorousness, and so isn't particularly relevant to deciding the moral rightness of eating meat.",,False,,t5_2qm7x,False,,,True,t3_11629x,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/11629x/why_do_people_think_that_the_presence_of_canine/,

I'm 32 and overweight.  I went to the doctor last weekend to get a check up specifically to find out why my leg was swelling up.  Basically the doctor told me I needed to lose weight and stay away from the sodium.  I started taking a account of a lot of things and I was happy that the doctor said I was not diabetic.  I decided that night to make a drastic change in my lifestyle. Since Monday I've abstained from any meat, and I am checking the sodium content of everything I now consume.

Today, all my friends wanted to go to Wing Zone to pig-out and I had to stand my ground and defend my newly acquired vegetarianism.  When they kept jabbing at my reasons, I finally said, ""I don't want to die"" and they dropped it there.  We ended up at Pita Pit and I had a Feta Pita.

So I've been a vegetarian for about 3 months now, and its been going pretty well. I only just came across this subreddit a while ago and I was excited to see it!

Although I'm a little confused by some of the posts here. There is a lot of negative comments regarding vegetarianism from users advocating a vegan lifestyle -- you know, constant reminders of the fact that unless you are raising your own chickens and cows, animals are dying for your milk and eggs. And they are harming the environment. And you can make 10,000+ delicious meals without them with the help of this book!

That isn't to say that vegetarians don't do the same damn thing. After all, if a ""vegetarian"" says they're a ""vegetarian"" but continues to eat fish or crustaceans  or INSECTS  or eats chicken once a month, they seem to be more or less shunned from the community from both the vegetarians and the vegans.

I just want to ask: why? I figure the vegan who eats one free range chicken a month (never seen this, but who knows) would actually contribute to less suffering than a vegetarian who eats milk and eggs everyday. Or the vegetarian who eats NOTHING but eggs. Or insects. And perhaps the vegan causes more suffering from their incessant bleating (I'm being facetious). But who the hell is counting? And why do we care so much?

The way I see it, is that there should be a community for people who want to do their part to eating less meat, exchange meat-free recipes, and talk about healthy nutrition. But the community has always been so dichotomous: you are either a vegetarian or you aren't. You are either a vegan or you are an insensitive, animal abusing prick. YES there is a definition for vegetarian just there is a definition for being ""gay"" but we all accepted that there can be variations on that theme. Its kind of like if we had a ""greener living"" reddit, and the bicycle riders scoffed at the hybrid car owners, and the dudes with windmills on their roof cannot possibly comprehend a lifestyle that doesn't involve windmills on their roof.

So what the hell am I talking about? I guess I'm looking to discuss with some fine subreddit members their take on definitions, I suppose, why there is a feeling of competition when it comes to how little meat you eat, and where people like to draw the line between ""doing their part for the animals"" and ""obviously putting very little effort in"". Or perhaps you don't think its about effort? Just give me your thoughts people!

And I apologize if this is an incredibly ranty post. I'm not honestly pissed off or anything. I think being a vegetarian/vegan/one-chicken-a-monthan is a difficult lifestyle, mostly because its such an ethical choice for some people, and its hard not to come across preachy when asked for opinions, but I think it does deter some people from considering it. To feel accepted its often ""all or nothing"".

* I don't really care for the taste of most meat, except the ones that are really bad for me (like bacon), so it seems like an easy sacrifice. 
* My father died in March from a heart attack. He was 48. I'm 25 and I don't want this to be my mid-life. I've heard a vegetarian diet can lower your risk of heart disease.  This is really the biggest reason.
* I don't want to contribute to the mistreatment of animals anymore. I don't believe that it's wrong to eat meat, but I get a queasy feeling when I think about how the animals kept for meat are treated. I don't believe that this will change, but I know I can contribute less to the problem.
* I am interested in discovering new recipes and trying things from menus that I haven't tried before. I just found out that my favorite pizza place in town has an even better salad for less than the price of two slices.

But, here are my questions / concerns.
* Are there any supplements I should consider taking?
* I'm sorry to ask this. I browsed your top posts and this is apparently the worst question I could possibly ask you, but where do I get my protein from? I know vegetables have protein, but are there some that have more than others? How much should I rely on beans, legumes, or nuts? Peanut butter?
* Are there any positive or negative things to expect with regard to my sex life? I am male, if that matters.
* How truthful are the rumors about the ill effects of soy? If they are truthful, is there a better substitute?
* Is there a good vegetarian recipe website or book you would recommend?
* I've abstained from meat for the past three days, and I noticed I've had to urinate a lot. Is that just a coincidence, or is it something that tends to happen?

I have noticed that some of you on here have been struggling with eating healthy while adhering to a vegetarian or vegan diet.

I have been working on this project with a small company. They normally focus on professional software to optimize diets. We have now ventured out into the app market, trying to compress such a complex topic into a small app.

Instead of focusing on single nutrients or calories this app zooms in on the (10) food groups and uses an individualized approach. The recommendations are based on a personal profile, including the activity level.

No need to read, just ranting.",fizzletto,61,31,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/sjsqz/ugh_intolerant_carnivores_make_me_so_frustrated/,"Even though I'm a vegetarian I still enjoy watching cooking videos involving meat. I still find it entertaining even though I don't eat it.

One of my favourite YouTube chefs recently posted a video with a recipe for a pasta dish. Throughout the video, at several points, she was raving about it being vegetarian friendly, and seemed quite proud of herself (as almost all of her other savoury dishes seem to include meat). She even made a point to use vegetable stock instead of chicken stock, in order to ""keep it vegetarian"".

Yet towards the end of the video, she dumped a whole load of parmesan cheese into the recipe. I don't know if you're aware, but proper Italian Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, which she was using, is most definitely not suitable for vegetarians. It's made using animal rennet, which you have to kill the calf in order to obtain. And obviously, vegetarians aren't supposed to eat anything that has come from an animal that's had to be killed to obtain the food. It's not at all uncommon for a vegetarian to not realise this, so you're welcome (and I apologise) if you only just found this out. 

But it makes me worried. I know that food products sold in supermarkets (at least here in the UK) have to be approved by the Vegetarian Society before you can claim that they're suitable for vegetarians. But in restaurants, it's up to the chef to decide whether to label a dish on the menu  as vegetarian-friendly or not. This makes me wonder how many meals I've eaten at a restaurant that were supposedly vegetarian friendly, because the chef didn't realise (or didn't care) that the parmesan cheese he used wasn't suitable.

Anyway, I commented on the video, informing the chef as politely as I could that this recipe wasn't in fact vegetarian friendly. I assured her that I knew it was an honest mistake and that the dish still looked great, and that I was definitely going to try it without the parmesan, but that I just thought she should know her mistake. 

I was absolutely accosted by angry, ignorant carnivores. My comment was actually hidden due to too many thumbs-down. I was met with replies such as ""Why should the chef care if the meal has parmesan cheese in if the vegetarians don't know?"" and ""You're wrong, rennet isn't meat, it's only vegans who can't eat cheese"". It just makes me so sad, that even in this day and age, vegetarians are treated with such intolerance and dare I say it, hate.

 My own grandmother phoned me the other night and the topic somehow turned to my not eating meat, at which point she tried to persuade me to eat meat again, and when I refused, sighed and said 'not another one' (referring to my Dad, a lacto vegetarian attempting to become vegan, whom my grandparents dislike mainly because of his diet choice). 

It all just makes me lose faith in humanity. I'm not one of those vegetarians who accuses meat-eaters of being murderers and treats everyone else as inferior to me due to their eating habits. I really have no problem with other people eating meat, heck, my mother and my boyfriend do so, even around me. But it's just times like these when I wish everyone would just wake up.

**TL;DR: Chef mistakenly labels dish as vegetarian even though it contains parmesan, I mention this, haters tear me apart. Made me upset.**",,False,,t5_2qm7x,False,,,True,t3_sjsqz,http://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/sjsqz/ugh_intolerant_carnivores_make_me_so_frustrated/,

Well when he asked why, instead of just saying its a choice, or something nice, i just said ""You have to kill animals to eat them; they probably had names."" The kid looked a little distressed from the sudden epiphany that they probably did have names. but i didnt get to see the shit storm i caused because i left quickly after saying that.

For the record, i didnt do this because i wanted to convert the kid. I did it for the same reason i go 5 under the speed limit: its funny.

We stock frozen meat (which I *hate* doing, but there's no way around it).  Often, clients will ask me for suggestions about which tastes better/which one they should choose/how to cook something (which I don't know at all b/c I stopped eating meat before I moved out and cooked for myself). 

A typical conversation goes like this:

* Person: How do I make this chicken?
* Me: I don't know. I don't eat meat.
* Person: Well, chicken isn't meat.
* Me: I don't eat any animals.
* Person: Not even fish?
* Me: A fish is an animal.
* Person: Well, what *do* you eat? Aren't you starving? (mind you, this is a food bank.  If anyone is starving here, it isn't me)
* Me: There are a lot of other things to eat. It's even cheaper.
* Person: You're crazy.

The worst is when a client tells me that they are a vegetarian and I say that I can substitute something for the meat and they say, ""Well, I still eat chicken and fish! Of course!""

I've even had someone say he was veggie and then ask for beef ravioli.  When I said it had meat in it, he said, ""Well, but it's in a can so it doesn't count.""

And once, a client came to me to complain that the meat that week was a package that was too small and that if I didn't give him more, I was trying to starve him because ""What do you expect me to eat?""

How often do you all hear something like this from omnivores? It used to not bother me so much, but after working here a while it is driving me crazy! 

Anyone have some awesome come-backs I can have ready?

edit: formatting

**EDIT**  When I posted this yesterday, I forgot to add what is perhaps my biggest problem with this attitude at the food bank:

If I have run out of frozen meat, most of the clients I serve will just turn around leave without taking anything, even if I have everything else (snacks, cereal, juice, fruits, starches, veggies, and even canned protein like tuna and beans and peanut butter).  So they would rather go without meat, and therefore all the other food, for a whole week than eat less meat for that week.  It makes me sad.

I don't usually eat faux meats, but I decided to try Quorn (for those who don't know what I'm talking about: http://www.quorn.com/) just to do something different. The two times I ate it (about 6 months apart) I got very sick, throwing up all night.


On the packing, it says ''produit à base de champignons''. Which means it's a product made of mushrooms. I often eat mushrooms, so no problem with that. But I googled ''reactions to quorn'' and found out that it's actually made of a kind of mold. As far as I know, molds and mushrooms are related but are not the same thing.
And apparently, this mold they use can cause pretty bad reactions.


Has anyone else had problems with this?
I'm not posting this here just to talk bad about Quorn, it doesn't make everyone sick. It tastes good (At least for me, it does) and it can be a good alternative for when you are craving a hot dog or whatever. But just so you guys know, be careful! The reactions I had were definitely not pleasant.

But here's the thing, I so badly want to be a vegetarian or at least drastically minimize how much meat I eat. If I'm at a friend's house and they cook only meat, eh, I'll live. But I really don't know how to start or what to do. I'm not super strong-willed... You should see me go through candy on Halloween. It's bad.

What do I do? Are there any former carnivores out there who can show me it's possible? My only vegetarian friend is hindu and has been vegetarian her whole life, so she doesn't really know how to help me with getting off my current diet. Also, I'm a 17 year old female if that matters?

There are lots of very good recipes that you all share. I have to say, many of them are very, very tasty.

My gripe is that there are now so many posts on who is and who isn't a *real* vegetarian. Or when you can and cannot call yourself a vegan. 

I mean, c'mon. We're not here because we're a small action committee that's trying to take over the world and, in turn, demonize anyone that 'doesn't fit' the definition. We're here because, for one reason or another, we enjoy it.

I know that, for some ridiculous reason, having a strict diet may get some jokes going, but self-righteousness as a response is not very becoming.

If someone wants to call hirself vegetarian, but eats a burger, s/he is not out of the vegetarian club. It's just what it is.

Vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, omnivore...it's all the same. We're all just here to enjoy talking about vegetarian goodness.

So c'mon folks, let's stop demonizing or categorizing one another please and get back to just enjoying the vegetarian conversations in here.

EDIT: I'm no longer commenting here. I'll come back and peruse the sub for some nice recipes. But the culture is spiteful and unforgiving. The mere mention of someone not using a word correctly was grounds for insults and demonizing. I just hope that folks will be enough at peace with their own meal decisions (and otherwise) so as to not have a chip on their shoulder and lash out everytime someone gets it wrong (even if it's accidental). Calling people 'laughably pathetic' was a surprise to me after seeing that being a vegetarian usually comes with a peaceful sense of being. I know it's tough to deal with the insults you may come across for choosing a specific diet, but as I alluded to above, aggressive push-back is no better.
