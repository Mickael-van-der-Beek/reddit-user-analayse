1375632844.0,376,self.MuseumOfReddit,1joo0t,Famous reddit users: /u/Unidan,UnholyDemigod,444,68,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1joo0t/famous_reddit_users_uunidan/,"Date account started - 24 Sep 09

To say /u/Unidan is the most popular user the site has ever had would not be an exaggeration. Every time you venture into a thread asking who your favourite user is, Unidan's name will be at the top, followed by nothing but praise. Why? Because Unidan is reddit's version of Steve Irwin: he teaches reddit the most wondrous things in the field of biology, and he does it with the most infectious enthusiasm, so much so that after seeing a comment start with ""biologist here!"", it's impossible to not be overcome with joy. Unidan is a biologist in real life, and in any thread that pertains to the field of biology, whether it be the functionality of a carnivorous plant, or how insects could decimate all of humanity if they chose to, he joins in to bestow upon us his wisdom. For most of his reddit 'career', Unidan was able to remain under the radar, popping up here and there to offer some knowledge. It wasn't until reddit allowed gold members to recieve notifications anytime someone shortlinks their username that he became as famous as he is now. Once that was brought in, people began to summon Unidan in every thread they thought he could impart knowledge on. Rather than doing what most would do and ignore the neverending summons, Unidan would respond to them all, making him known to probably every user on the site, and through all the constant summining, he has maintained his cheery disposition, and continues to teach us, because he's that much of an awesome guy. 

**Notable events:**

* [does an AMA and promises to answer questions until the thread is locked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d42co/i_am_the_excited_biologist_ama/)

* [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ikkhp/so_this_isnt_a_tree_it_is_a_weed_more_pictures/cb5dme9?context=3) are [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cz41n/what_is_the_most_unbelievable_fact_you_have_ever/c9ldj41?context=3) examples of the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1eijha/this_looks_like_a_nice_place_to/ca0ldhh?context=3) that made him famous. 

Unidan has agreed to answer a few questions about himself. 

**How did you discover reddit?**

&gt; I discovered Reddit through my friends who suggested it to me. /u/hypno_beam is the guy who actually pulled me onto it and got me to make an account, and it's been downhill ever since! It was basically by hanging around a bunch of my other similarly nerdy friends who were in computer science and physics-based fields.

**Do you like being reddit famous?**

&gt; It's certainly interesting! It's actually opened up some interesting doors for me in the way of becoming more involved with science education and science writing. It's been really cool to be able to spin some of my procrastination time into work time, or time spent educating myself or others. It probably bumped up my procrastination time, but I've definitely learned a whole bunch in the process! It's also forced me to be more diligent in a way, as when I don't follow through on something, I have about a thousand messages in my inbox telling me to get my act together!

**What do you do in real life?**

&gt; In real life, I'm a scientist, specifically an ecosystems ecologist and even more specifically than that, a nitrogen biogeochemist! I also teach at my university, this upcoming semester I'll be teaching a course in Animal Behavior. Aside from my professional stuff, I hike for fun (here's a shot I took this weekend on a hike with friends in Connecticuit), play games with friends, all the usual stuff. A lot of my friends have some interesting things about them which makes some of my free time pretty wild, too. For example, helping friends with their falconry! I also used to do oil paintings and did a variety of martial arts like Kendo, though now I'm trying to get a bit more into cycling and such. To counter-act physical activity, I enjoy things like bourbon and cooking! Before being a biologist, I was a cook for years for an Italian caterer. In college, I was a part of an improvisational comedy group, and I still meet up with alumni to put on shows every now and again. We performed in the Del Close Marathon most recently, but we've also performed as the opening act for Snooki, Jim Norton, and Derrick Comedy (Donald Glover was kind of a jerk to us, but the other two guys were super nice).

**Is your reddit personality much different from your real personality?**

&gt; A bit, I think the takeaway message on my Reddit persona is that I'm overly cheerful, which I think is true for me in real-life on the inside. I tend to be optimistic about a lot of things and like to roll with the punches; however, I'm very sarcastic which I think gets underplayed through Reddit when I'm trying to be more informative! Also, in real life, my friends make fun of me constantly for the Reddit fame, so there's a lot more cursing.",,False,,t5_2wevq,False,,,True,t3_1joo0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1joo0t/famous_reddit_users_uunidan/,

At the time, the subreddit had less than 500 subscribers. The radio enthusiasts responded with welcoming comments and hilarious banter.

One user notified /r/trees that they had lost a member, and [a search party was sent out](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/iwr3u/i_think_one_of_your_users_got_high_and_wandered/) to rescue the lost ent.

/u/inwats continues the hilarious interaction with an [amateur radio post in /r/trees](http://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/iw0ro/hey_rtrees_today_i_woke_upate_breakfasttook_a/c274x37), which gets loads of attention from the ents.

Finally it comes full circle when a [thread is posted in /r/amateurradio](http://www.reddit.com/r/amateurradio/comments/iwzz1/i_think_one_of_your_users_got_high_and_wandered/), basically mirroring the incident in /r/trees! 

By the end of the day the wandering redditor was rescued, tiny /r/amateurradio skyrocketed in users, and new friends were made! One of the cutest interactions between subreddits, if you ask me.

To call karmanaut the most notorious and well-known user in the site's history would not be far from lying. Since joining the site, karmanaut has grown to be a name known by all, a person respected by some and hated by more. There's a running joke on reddit, that being that there's only 2 people on this site. You, and karmanaut controlling every other account. The reason being is that karmanaut has been proven to be behind several other high profile accounts, such as [bechus](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cl81x/a_violation_of_trust_and_community_values/c0td6ln), [ProbablyHittingOnYou](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pwrtf/the_karmanaut_is_phoy_pastebin_file_now_with_100/), and [RedditNoir](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbvpc). Not only does he have those, he also make alts just for general posting, and moves onto another once his account reaches 20-30K comment karma so he can maintain a sense of anonymity. Those 4 accounts add up to about 1 million karma. Add in all the minors on top of that and it's highly likely that karmanaut has earned more comment karma than anyone else. While karmanaut was already very well known, due to earning 100K karma in about 6 months (which he did 3 years ago which is even more insane), it wasn't until 'Karmagate' that karmanaut became what he's known as today. After /r/Iama's creator left, [he gave the subreddit to karmanaut](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/just3/i_am_that_asshole_all_of_you_hate_so_much_32bites/), and karmanaut changed the rules to try and bring a level of quality it never had. After removing /u/violentacrez' AMA, things quickly went downhill for him. After removing Bad Luck Brian's AMA, the masses turned on karmanaut (even though it turned out to be fake), and kept up the hatred for about 8 months, constantly downvoting and harassing him whenever they could. After a while, the horde dissipated, and now those events are nothing more than a memory, and a warning of what happens when you piss off the masses. 

**Notable events:**

* [has the most downvoted comment ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/s5guk/iam_bad_luck_brian_ama/c4b8m3u)

* [was the subject of witchhunts and questioning whether mods have too much power](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/)

* [the origins of the ""karmanaut is multiple people"" running joke](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/b0l1x/this_is_not_my_account_what_are_the_best_things/c0kcoeo?context=1)

Karmanaut also agreed to answer some questions. 

**How did you discover reddit?**

&gt; A friend at work told me about it. I looked at it, and thought it was boring, so I didn't really come back for another few months. But then I got hooked.

**Do you like being reddit famous?**

&gt; No. I just want to comment on stuff, and it's really annoying when people care more about who is making the comment then what the comment actually says.

&gt;  That is why I change accounts regularly. I've had a few names become well known, and it is annoying every time. So now I just change before it gets noticed.

**What do you do in real life?**

&gt; I'm a lawyer

**Is your reddit personality much different from your real personality?**

&gt; I don't really think so. The difference is that I keep the sarcastic comments to myself in real life, instead of saying them out loud.

Known to many as a very good moderator, he was hated by many for the subreddits he presides over, as they were of a pornographic nature. After being a reddit users for several years, he deleted his account. Here's why:

* quite some time ago, journalist Adrien Chen [did an AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p50em/i_am_a_gawker_staff_writer_ama/), but it didn't go over so well, with many reddit users insulting him due to past articles he'd written that painted reddit in a negative light. Chen held a resentment towards reddit since then

* SRS initiates [Project Panda](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/1006qd/meta_project_panda_the_fuckredditbomb/), a plan to bring down everything on reddit they don't agree with. One of the subreddits on their hitlist: /r/CreepShots

* on 10/10/12, VA deletes his account. [It comes out](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/118qdg/the_real_reason_why_violentacrez_deleted_his/) that Adrien Chen, still harbouring resentment, working for Gawker and possibly alerted by Project Panda, doxxed him (discovered publicly identifying information). Worried his identity might be revealed, VA deletes his account hoping it will stop Chen. It does not. Chen revealed his name, which ends up getting VA fired from his actual job. Anderson Cooper approaches him looking for an interview, which VA agrees to. 

* the same day VA deleted his account, [this message](http://i.imgur.com/AL52y.png) was sent from an SRSer to the head of /r/CreepShots, blackmailing him. He did as was asked shortly after, closing the subreddit and deleting his account. 

* [/r/violentacrez is then taken over by SRSers](http://www.reddit.com/r/violentacrez/comments/11930v/a_change_in_direction/), who then threaten to [go after /r/MensRights next](http://i.imgur.com/Lscan.jpg)

* nothing happens next apart from many subreddits discussing what has happened, and it slowly fizzles as people move on to other things

Most things happened in the space of a single day (10 Oct 12), and caused many cries to have SRS shut down for doxxing. It wasn't, but the accounts that did it no longer exist, so I can only assume they were banned.

Naturally, reddit 'blew up' as well, as being a social media site, it's a haven for current news. Two of the biggest subreddits to post information were /r/worldnews and /r/news. Being that /r/worldnews is only for posting non-US news stories, they began removing the posts from there, [which angered a lot of people](http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1cerrp/boston_marathon_explosions_dozens_wounded_as_two/c9fsp4i). As more people went over to [the posts in /r/news](http://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/1cen3t/there_was_just_an_explosion_at_the_boston/), the admins realised that they needed a primary US news subreddit that wasn't politically based, so /r/news was added to the defaults. 

Over the next few days, the Internet turned on Batman Mode, and started posting pictures and theories to 'help' identify the bad guys. [One person was Sunil Tripathi, who had gone missing on Apr 16](http://np.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1cn7ax/recently_missing_brown_university_student_sunil/). This misidentification ignited a witchhunt, which only ceased when the current suspects were found by actual authorities. On Apr 22, the admins [made a blog post](http://blog.reddit.com/2013/04/reflections-on-recent-boston-crisis.html?m=1) apologising to Sunil's family for the grievances caused, among other things. On Apr 23, Sunil's body was discovered in a river. 

It should be noted that the misidentification was not just reddit's fault; other websites such as 4chan were also failing at playing detective too. ",,False,,t5_2wevq,False,,,True,t3_1iv343,http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1iv343/the_boston_bombing_debacle/,

Since first making his account, the majority of his comments were contextual responses in the form of watercolour paintings that were, well, shit. Since his [first one](http://imgur.com/AFv6O), his skill has grown [quite considerably](http://i.imgur.com/KdgwoTC.jpg). If you actually go back and look at several of his paintings, you can see him getting better as he does more. 

**Notable events:**

* has provided paintings for several notable people during AMAs, including [Barack Obama](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60njqd) 

* [was banned](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ueu4j/karmanaut_is_at_it_again_shitty_watercolour/) from /r/iama by /u/karmanaut, which caused massive drama that lasted for quite some time

* has his own subreddit at /r/Shitty_Watercolour where you can visit his website and donate to charity

/u/Shitty_Watercolour also agreed to answer some questions:

**How did you discover reddit?**

&gt; I can't remember exactly, I think I just happened upon it one day and lurked for a long time before doing anything.

**Do you like being reddit famous?**

&gt; If I didn't have the support from reddit that I get, then I probably wouldn't have kept up painting for as long as I have. The positive comments and messages that I get as a result of being reddit 'famous' are really nice too. The problem with being a well known novelty is that you have to let down a lot of people when they ask for paintings or try to summon you, which isn't so nice to have to do.

**What do you do in real life?**

&gt; In real life I paint and occasionally go to lectures at the university I attend.

**Is your reddit personality much different from your real personality?**

&gt; It's different in the sense that I've never really painted before in my life, so to be known for painting is quite peculiar.

1374930007.0,78,self.MuseumOfReddit,1j5paj,[MODPOST] Howdy folks (and some announcements too),UnholyDemigod,96,18,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1j5paj/modpost_howdy_folks_and_some_announcements_too/,"Howdy readers, I figured since the subscriber base has grown quite a bit I'd make a post saying hi and all that stuff. I made one before, but that was when we had maybe a couple of hundred subs. There's now more than 10,000! So...hi. Umm...how's it going? Anyway, I thought with the subscriber count being what it is, I'd go over the premise of the subreddit and that stuff. 

First of all, I got bored and changed the submit buttons. ""Submit an artifact"" is for link posts, and ""document some history"" is for self posts, in case you need to explain what's actualy going on, or submit several links together, that sort of thing. I also disabled downvotes, because just because you don't like it, it doesn't mean it's not something worthy of posting (I had to go to SRS and /r/mylittlepony for some of these links. Ugh). If you're one of the people who've disabled custom styles, please don't downvote anything in here. 

Secondly, the idea for this subreddit was born of seeing people referring to posts like ""today you, tomorrow me"", Streetlamp le Moose and the Cumbox, and always having someone ask what it was in reference to. Using the dodgy search feature made it really difficult to find the links on a whim, so I made this place to store everything for easy finding. Because of this, I'd very much appreciate it if when submitting something, you can title it by what it's known as. For example, for the cumbox, ""lynfect's dirty secret"" would be a poor title, as people who don't know the guy's name wouldn't be able to find it. Including 'cumbox' in the title makes for very easy searching ([like so](http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/search?q=Cumbox&amp;restrict_sr=on)). 

Secondly, (or third for those keeping count), if submitting something younger than six months old, please remember to use the no participation domain to avoid vote brigading. Think of it like this: archaeologists observe history. They don't interfere with it. Also, please remember to use the context provider if a comment needs it to save everyone else from having to click 'parent' several times. How to do both of these are provided in the sidebar. 

Fourth, remember that this place is for famous posts. What doesn't belong: any old post that you think was pretty cool, typical /r/bestof content, something you don't like, things that were highly upvoted and then forgotten an hour later, etc etc. What does belong: stuff that reddit talks about for years (Wadsworth Constant, baconing narwhals, etc), things that consumed the site for some time (Boston Bombing stuff, VA getting doxxed, etc). 

Fifth (last one), [the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/wiki/index). This is the 'directory', so to speak, so you can browse at your leisure without having to specifically search for a certain post. Not everything gets put in there, because some things are only mildly famous, but not not-famous enough to warrant removal. Also, please don't repost stuff. Trying to do so directs you to the already-posted thread, so don't try and get cheeky and be all ""oh, but I didn't know"". I'm on to you bastards. You won't get banned or anything, but I will remove the ones I see, just to keep the place free of clutter. 

And lastly (yeah, I lied, sue me), you'll tend to find that I'm pretty chill as a person, and even as a mod. I tend to be more personable than anything, so if you've got some questions just ask. It'll only cost you a dollar. I also like to speak a lot of shit, so if you crack the poopies because I'm not taking my 'job' as a moderator seriously, I'll just tell you to dry your eyes, princess. One thing I do take seriously though is the rules of the site, namely personal information (some of you may know that already). Some things that get posted in here may end up pissing off some of you, so if I see you trying to start a witchhunt, or doxxing, or any of that shit, I'll be going straight to the admins and getting you banned. 

That's it from me. Thanks for reading. Unless you didn't read it. In that case, up ya bum with chewy gum.

As this subreddit is (currently) only 8 hours old, I thought I'd go over a few pointers first

* this subreddit is for the posts and comments that are famous (and infamous), not the best, so don't cross post everything you see in /r/bestof. Posts that have been massively downvoted are welcome here. 

* on that note, 2 reminders. 1: please respect reddiquette. If you see a post in here that makes you want to stab a kitten, keep your frustrations here. Please don't hunt down the poster and harass them. 2: if a post is younger than 6 months old and hasn't been archived, use the No Participation domain to avoid vote brigading. For information, refer to the sidebar (read the rest of the stuff there too)

* post removal is at moderator discretion. If we think a linked post isn't well-known enough to be 'catalogued', we reserve the right to remove it. Reposts may be removed dependig on how long it's been since it was last posted. That's not to say we're going to be totalitarian fascists, but if this subreddit grows, you all know what happens to subreddits when they become popular, so we may need to step in to enforce quality.

Please observe and DO NOT TOUCH.***

**Brief intro:**

/u/A858DE45F56D9BC9 is a user who posts 64 bit, encoded submissions to the subreddits he created and maintains. There’s been an allure about it since he was first discovered. His submissions gained a moderate amount of hype on reddit and elsewhere, especially after one of the posts were decoded by another user.

* Reddit user makes joke about /u/A858 (his shorthand) about him being the “Stonehenge of reddit.”  /u/Fragglet decoded a following submission to discover ASCII Stonehenge with his ASCII signature. [Seen here.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/k96b1/201109081949/)

* Featured article. [Seen here.](http://www.dailydot.com/culture/code-redditor-secret-ascii/)

* /u/Fragglet decoded another post, a Sarah Palin .gif. [Seen here.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/jcm5f/201108081902/c2b3nt3) 

**More complete story:**

/u/A858DE45F56D9BC9 has his own subreddit, /r/A858DE45F56D9BC9. In his sub he posts somewhat frequently. However, when he gains a lot of attention, he sometimes quits posting, sends his sub private, and/or deletes all of his old posts. This mystery user has 7 link karma though has never been observed to have posted anything other than self posts.

This user or entry into the /r/MuseumofReddit isn't as *epic* as perhaps the Confession Bear confessing to murder, Cat Facts, or /u/Laurelai, but has sometimes garnered a lot of concentrated interest. For example, the link I posted above where other media websites have covered the /u/A858

As the previous link displayed, one time, /u/A858 posted something that was decodable. [Check out this post.](http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/k96b1/201109081949/) Unfortunately, /u/A858 deleted the original post, however you can see the subsequent thread. If you noticed, /u/Fragglet was the decoder, and he has been the most visible-outside force of all of this. To perhaps explain /u/A858's post, I believe a user had joked /u/A858 was the ""Stonehenge of reddit."" Fittingly, this post was created in response to said joke.

There are a few theories with which I'm familiar as to the existence of /u/A858. The first, obvious one, is a troll. A good one too. Not because people are watching what could essentially be nothing, but because when it does garner interest he disappears initiating even more speculation.

The second theory is that he's using reddit's servers to document or archive data. This is probably not the case, as I once read, because reddit has frequently crashes and its search bar isn't very reliable. Storing data on a server for immediate recall needs to have a constant and reliable connection, and that's not something reddit provides.

The last theory I will speculate on is the possibility it's to attract and recruit cryptographers. Though, to the best of my knowledge, /u/Fragglet was never contacted by /u/A858 and recruited to the CIA, NSA, or some other private security firm. Also, if its purpose were to attract amateur cryptographers, deleting posts and becoming withdrawn is an, as of yet, unproven method of successful recruiting.

**AGAIN. Please. Don't make a nuisance in his or her sub.**

^(A once private, but open **and low key** sub exists to attempt to uncover anything possible about this. Please PM me, /u/MuonDragon, /u/augenwiehimmel, or /u/Fragglet for more information. It's not hard to find, but *contribute to that community* if you do find it.)",,False,,t5_2wevq,1375111071.0,,,True,t3_1ja2ds,http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/comments/1ja2ds/famous_reddit_users_ua858de45f56d9bc9/,
