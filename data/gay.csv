I then came to the realization that yes, our world today certainly has many problems. There are many things that contribute to its' downward spiral, but homosexuality simply isn't one of them. We've got terrorists blowing limbs off the people who only desired to run a race in a marathon. We've got sick, mindless people who go to elementary schools and blow the brains out of young, innocent children. We've got deranged people who set out to kill as many people as possible for simply wanting to catch the midnight viewing of the highly anticipated, newest batman film. How on earth is it possible to instead focus more on expressing disapproval of legally allowing gay marriage? It blew my mind that people honestly felt like homosexuality was one of our biggest problems in our world today. The more I thought about it, the more I realized its not a problem at all. How could it be a crime to love someone as the same gender? It hit me like a ton of bricks. In a world full of hate, you all are fighting to love. 

For the past five hours I've read every scripture, every verse. Those who campaign against homosexuality, certainly aren't campaigning against shaving, getting your hair cut in particular styles, or wearing cotton/polyester shirts, which are all forbidden ""laws"" in the same book that forbids homosexuality. You don't get to choose which laws you want to enforce and which ones you don't. Those laws weren't even written for us, they were written for the people of Israel. The laws that we were supposed to abide with from the Old Testament was added to the New Testament. Forbidding shaving, haircuts and cotton shirts weren't added. Forbidding homosexuality wasn't either. 

Apart from the religious standpoint (which is only significant because it seems to be argued the most) Judging others and refusing them rights simply because they don't share the same beliefs as you, is morally wrong. My apologies to all of you who are or ever have been victims of bullies and malicious attacks. It takes brave, courageous people to stand up for what you believe in. For what it's worth, you have my full support. I only wish I'd realized years ago, how ignorant my mindset was. It probably doesn't mean much, but please know that as you all continue to fight for the rights and equality that you deserve, I'll be fighting just as hard. 

 For those of you who have endured the heartless insults and ignorant judging from others, please know that you are also being admired for your courage and determination to fight for your rights. I'm an admirer. ",,False,self,t5_2qhef,1367446193.0,,,True,t3_1di4nt,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1di4nt/i_just_came_here_to_say_that_for_years_i_just/,

Everybody knows we just recently repealed DADT. This was my very first experience of somebody being openly gay in the Navy like this. 

This past friday, afte 6 weeks of intense training and indoctrination, select E6's in my command were promoted to the prestigious rank of E7, or Navy Chief. (To put this into perspective, and highlight the importance, around 6000 people took the test for advancement to E7 and less than 200 made it. It's the biggest and most important promotion in the Navy.) There were 9 from my command that were pinned on Friday. 

During the pinning, each Chief Select is called on stage one by one and whomever they chose to pin their anchors on their collar comes up, has their name read by the MC, and pins the new Chief. It's a very formal and long-standing tradition. At one point, the MC said, ""Chief Select John Smith will be pinned by his partner Chris Smith."" And a man walked on stage, pinned the Chief, and then they shared a brief kiss and embrace before walking off the stage together.

I think this shocked a lot of people because, like me, this is the first instance of seeing this happen, openly, in uniform. I was happy, though, there were no boos, whispers, or gasps. Everybody actually clapped. It was heartwarming.

I know there's a long way to go (DoMA, etc) but it's definitely a step in the right direction.

Anyway, just wanted to share. Thanks for reading.

1344652756.0,134,self.gay,y13rs,A Straight Guy's Education in Gayitude,CitizenTed,156,22,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/y13rs/a_straight_guys_education_in_gayitude/,"I'm a straight guy. But I once had a gay buddy named Leo.

Leo was from a conservative Mexican family. His father was one of those guys with a pencil-thin mustache and stern desire to see his two boys integrate fully and become educated, productive members of society. Leo's older brother did just that: went to college and started a meaningful career. But Leo? Leo was gay. And he didn't want to go to college, much less church. He wanted to smoke weed and have fun. Something else: Leo had contracted HIV. 

Leo still lived at home with his parents and their resentment was palpable. Gay, AIDS and no job. Not exactly what they had in mind when they were raising him. 

They didn't realize how sensitive Leo was about other people. I was his best friend and I was straight. He never made passes at me or made me feel uncomfortable. Just the opposite: he totally understood me and knew I just liked to smoke and joke and socialize downtown. We were friends and he was totally capable of maintaining the boundaries of two guys who were pals. 

Being an inquisitive sort, I regularly asked Leo about what it meant and how it felt to be gay. He was very honest and clear about it and was very excited to illuminate me about it. Like most young guys, I couldn't wrap my head around not being attracted to young women. Didn't he have even the slightest aesthetic appreciation for the female form? 

Of course he did. But he explained that his sexual attraction was tilted to a much higher degree toward men, just like I might ""appreciate"" strawberry ice cream but much prefer Rocky Road. He felt all humans had a sliding scale of gender attraction and that cultural mores repressed even the slightest hint of same-sex attraction among straight men. This got me thinking: had I been programmed? 

To a certain extent yes and to another extent, no. Sure, I was much better off in society being as straight as Clint Eastwood at a gunfight. But the fact remained I was insanely attracted to women and found men to be...ugly hairy apes. If my sexual orientation was so indelibly defined then Leo's probably was, too. He had no option and no choice. If only his parents could understand that. 

Leo was also a believer in ""gaydar"". He said when he met me he knew in a heartbeat I was hopelessly straight and there was no point in hitting on me, so he never did. He said he could walk through the shopping mall and know with a glance who was and wasn't gay. I tested his gaydar several times and it was pretty damn accurate. 

We had many conversations about gay and straight, the aesthetics of beauty, the parallels and differences between gay and straight dating and the problems of being a gay man in a society that viewed them as evil and weak. Leo opened my eyes and he did in a way that was sympathetic and humorous. 

One day, Leo got really sick. He smoked a lot of weed (thus generating an appetite) to keep his weight up, but he was getting thin. He went in the hospital and once again bounced back. Many doctors gathered around to look as his blood numbers and declared his quick recovery to be worthy of publishing in medical journals. 

I remember visiting him in the hospital and being asked to wear a mask in his room. I didn't have the heart to tell the nurse I had smoked a hundred joints with the guy and if his saliva was deadly I was probably in deep shit already, but I just obeyed and spent the afternoon talking with Leo with a big monkey mask on my face. 

Leo got out of the hospital, but this time something was different. He weight was back, but he was weaker. Also, he was starting to get a little bit demented. He'd sometimes talk in circles and laugh at things that weren't funny. 

As the months went by he got worse. He was always cool around me but around other people (including our friendly weed connection) he would act surly and unreasonable. He started stealing money from people then denying it. I tried talking to him about it, but he brushed it off. there was no problem, he said. Everyone else was just acting like assholes. We drifted apart. 

Eventually, he burned some very good friends of mine. I found myself having to choose between his friendship and theirs. He was becoming really irrational. I felt bad, but there was nothing I could do. Leo moved to San Francisco to find greener pastures. But he found none. 

He called me once, ranting about what assholes people were in San Francisco. He was drifting from bedsits to homeless shelters. He was drugging it up hard and spinning out of control. He said his days were numbered and he was going to do what he wanted to do. Fuck everybody. He wanted me to come up and visit. I never did. That was the last time we spoke. 

In July of 1989, I was hanging out at the bar when my buddy Dale rushed in and told me Leo had died. I knew it was coming, but it felt awful. Leo's parents refused to pick up the body. If we didn't rush to San Francisco and make a claim on the body, he'd be cremated and his ashes tossed. 

I just couldn't do it. And I wasn't even sure what Leo really wanted. We let the State do what it wanted. Leo was just a memory now. 

But I never forgot him. He put a human face on gay rights. And that's the most powerful tool you can have to win hearts and minds. I'm still straight as ever yet you won't find a more ardent supporter of gay rights. Denying gay people the right to marry then dismissing them as hopelessly promiscuous is the height of arrogance and hypocrisy. 

I'm not gay, but I think I know how gays feel in America. Good luck to you all. You're not alone.

I turn around and just give a look like really thanks for noticing and yelling it. His friend says back, ""dude shut up your being an idiot."" So I get my shot and go to my family. Wanting another shot I go back to the bar but go to the other side of the bar so it's not ""awkward"" I guess. But I see his friend come over to me (who is like a big biker guy with the beard and outfit) puts his hand on my back leans in and says, ""hey don't listen to my stupid drunk friend. You look like a nice young kid and don't need shit like that from anyone. Plus just so you know me and other people out there are rooting for you guys to get your rights back. Sorry again and this shots on me."" I sit there stunned and still amazed at what just happen.

I have two very close gay friends, and to me, he's just like 'another one of the guys'. But one of my girl friends introduced me to one of her gay friends, and his accusations were quite atrocious. First of all, I'm not sure if he was hitting on me or if he was just a touchy person, but be popped my personal bubble and I tried to keep my distance. I was really nice to him as a group of us went out for lunch, I even tried to engage him in conversations a few time. Later after we departed he texted that same girl friend saying , quote, ""I can't believe you are friends with that homophobic prick"". She told me this after she was questioning me about being homophobic, which I turned down all accusations of. The truth is, I didn't like him. I thought he was annoying. He was very loudspoken and took crossed the ""flamboyant"" line and went well into the ""flambannoying"" line.  
Long story short, in my opinion, sometimes there are people who you think are homophobic, but really, they just don't consider you a friend. Please don't jump to conclusions about people being homophobic, it's a serious accusation. I thought you'd guys like to here my story, and if this gets downvoted, so be it.

It wasn't long before they started talking about homecoming which is coming off.

A couple of the Freshies were single and their friends were listing off a list of girls they could go with.  They all chimed in ""Yeah, you've GOTTA take a girl to homecoming or your not a real man"".  This was the type of thing i was expecting to hear, when suddenly one of them said that they really weren't interested in girls.  Once again i braced myself for verbal pollution.

Then, the best thing I've heard in a long time came out of almost all of their mouths. ""Cool"" ""Well bring a guy, all good"" ""Rly? cool"" and then they just kept on going. Like nothing happened.  Best thing i could ever expect to hear from Freshmen ever.

Well its been 17 days. I ran away to OKC for a bit, but due to how long it would take for my nursing license to transfer I returned to KS and am now sleeping in car and job hunting. Last I heard he is still in ATL burning through my money and fucking his way to more. I just wanted to say thanks to all of you. I was ready to end my life that night, I felt worthless and lonely, and hurt so badly. This community made me realize I am better off without his abuse and lies. I unloaded the shotgun and picked up the phone and went out with friends. Since that night things are still hard but i know I'll make it now. Once I get a job I can recover everything he stole from me, and the guy I am currently seeing is trying to work through my trust issues and pain. Because of all of you I will live to pick up the pieces of my life. And I will NEVER, EVER take him back. I promise that.

1367805680.0,91,self.gay,1drm5m,I hope you're remembering to play safe because...,BurnTheThirdSon,106,15,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1drm5m/i_hope_youre_remembering_to_play_safe_because/,"You never know what the person you're having sex with will do. I'm not saying that I always use protection but I do use it when I'm having sex with someone I barely know or trust and last night I got a shocking realisation that I should be more careful when meeting with guys.

What made me realise this? Well last night a random guy messaged me asking if I wanted to get fucked, bare, by his *poz* cock. I have nothing against guys with HIV because you never know how they got it, for all I know they could of been raped so I politely told him that I wasn't interested in unprotected sex with a guy who had HIV. I didn't tell him to fuck off or anything and kept talking to him afterwards, I even asked him if he's ever *pozzed* someone which he replied saying he had fucked one *neg* guy. It's nice that he told me immediately that he's *poz* but he was persistent and kept trying to persuade me to meet up with him, for bare sex of course. After that I started ignoring him and he did leave me alone, though I'm not sure that's the last I'll hear from him.

That experience only made me think I should be more careful about the guys I'm meeting up with. Tonight I was telling this guy that I've been talking to a lot recently online about it and eventually we got on the topic of meeting up for fun, we exchanged pics and all that as you do but then came then he asked me if I fuck bare. I told him I'd rather not especially after the *poz* guy messaged me and what did he reply with? He replied saying that he could *stealth* me which itself defeated the purpose of *stealthing* but still, he had the intention of it and said it's only if I wanted it (like seriously defeats the purpose of *stealthing* if you're going to ask them if they want you to do it).

Now I'm not new to the scene and I've known all about these sort of acts for some time now but it's the first time someone's asked me stuff like this and I think that it's a good idea to tell you guys what sort of things you should be careful of.

**What you may need to know:**

- It's basic knowledge that *poz* means HIV+ and *neg* means HIV-.

- *Stealthing* is the act of fucking someone unprotected without their consent, this can be done many ways such as; slipping the condom off mid-way through sex, purposely breaking the condom mid-way through sex (there are various ways to sabotage a condom) or tricking you into thinking they put on the condom before entering you.

*Stealthing* has another definition too, *pozzing* someone without their knowledge whether or not they consent to unprotected sex. I should note that *stealthing* works two ways, you can't just be *stealthed* by a *top* but you can also be *stealthed* by *bottoms*.

- There are men who identify as *bug chasers* which are men who are wanting to get HIV, likewise there are men who are *gift givers* or *gifters* who are men that want to give you the disease.

- Some *gifters*, as to make it more likely for you to catch the disease, will sometimes by various means make your hole bleed so the virus can get into you system (examples being roughly fingering your ass, with long sharp fingernails or tearing your ass open by shoving either a big object like a dildo in or their cock without stretching you first or using lube). Saying all that some will refrain from using lube as it's counter-productive to their goal.

- Many *poz* men get a *biohazard tattoo* or a similar tattoo, it's sort of a trophy to say they're *poz*. Though it's not to say that all men with that tattoo are *poz* but if you were thinking of getting that tattoo because it looks cool, you may want to be aware of it's use beforehand. :P


So yea, if you're wanting to play it safe and stay away from diseases please be careful of what's happening. Don't have sex with someone you don't trust and be aware of what's happening, if you feel a slight change in sensations make sure the condom is still on and unbroken.

**The purpose of this post is not to tell you to use protection, it's not to take the fun out of sex. The purpose of this post is to make you aware of the dangers out there and advise you against them. You have sex how you like and as carefree as you like, I will not judge anyone upon their decision as it's your life and you may do as you wish with it.**",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_1drm5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1drm5m/i_hope_youre_remembering_to_play_safe_because/,

1370919918.0,80,self.gay,1g3ek5,A whirlwind ripped the closet from around me :),Anotherbad,94,14,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1g3ek5/a_whirlwind_ripped_the_closet_from_around_me/,"48 hours ago I was a 21 year old, closeted, virgin. Two nights before I drunkenly hit on my straight friend and was pretty embarrassed by the whole episode. The guy is a little obtuse and only thought I was questioning his sexuality but failed to understand the proposition. I had come too close, and desperately needed to remedy the situation. 

I awoke 48 hours ago and set off to the local used book store/rad coffee shop. The place was busy, the tables taken, so I settled into a plush couch. I was sipping in my americano and a man asked if he could take the seat next to me. He introduced himself as Jeremy. Two streaks of green and blue in his black hair were a total gay giveaway. A little chit chat, and I worked up the courage to ask if he would like to walk with me. He said yes, and the whirlwind had started. 

In the three hours that followed we traversed the open air viaduct above the train tracks. Here fluid conversation had me telling him the intimate details of my being. I knew this was the guy I could entrust more than my ideas with. We ended up at a park laying on our backs describing the things we could see in the clouds. We were briefly interrupted by a phone call saying he was late to an appointment, he cancelled it. We parted ways when he left for work. 

I had spent the past decade confused about my sexuality. I tried with women a few times but the experience was always excruciatingly forced. I dreaded that point where, when becoming friends with a woman, she would get feelings for me. This, this on the other hand, was natural. I was giddy. It had no bearing of resemblance to any first dates I had ever been on. I got home and we texted over the next few hours. He asked if he could pick me up after he got off of work, I agreed. I was hardly able to stop myself from jumping on him at the park.

He surprised me by taking me into the mountains in the dark. We bouldered up treacherous rocks until we were, what seemed to be, hundreds of feet off the ground. He had picked up from our earlier conversation that I liked the out doors. The stars at 9000 ft were beyond what I had ever seen. We held hands as anything more was prevented by the way we were very slowly sliding down the boulder on which we were perched. After a few hours of the most erotic and romantic hand holding I have ever experienced we headed down to make fire. I'm not sure everything we spoke about that first night, a mere 8 hours after we first met, but we stayed until sunrise. I had gotten to peek at and feel his chest and abs, but as temperatures dropped and rocks dug into our backsides, the possibility of much more was ruled out. 

I had, with the least noble of intentions, already purchased breakfast ingredients, and invited him back to my apartment. But by the time we made it back down from the mountain, with a mass of hesitation in his voice, he said needed to go home and get ready for work. It was 6 am.

The day passed and I tried to get some recovery sleep. There was absolutely no way I could not share the story among friends. Coming out to them was glorious. it was gleeful. There was not a shred of self doubt as I waited in anticipation of nightfall.

I will leave to the imagination all that happened last night(and this morning!). I got to use my breakfast ingredients.

That is something I attribute to uneducated rednecks, old angry white men, or people confused about their sexuality. Last week I saw this gross act of homophobia followed by this amazing reaction from everyone around me. I've wanted to tell this story that made me feel a bit proud of my generation and figured this would be the place to tell it. Just standing in a long multiple lines at CVS, its late, were all smooshed together, everyone is around the same age buying the same crap. When suddenly the guy infront of me turns to the guy next to him and says ""Quit bumping into me! I am not your boyfriend queer."" This was followed by a moment of silence from the crowd- then everyone completely outraged, yelling at the guy until he left the store. I absolutely loved the fact that not a single person tolerated that behavior. Admittedly, my first reaction was burst out laughing and said to the guy ""you're fucking kidding right? Don't talk to him that way."" It was just such a ridiculous thing to say. My absolute favorite moment came from the two 4'11 heavily eyebrow penciled Hispanic goddesses who torn this guy apart. ""What you mean boyfriend? You couldn't get him! You ugly son! Your ass is ugly!"" I swear they heckled him into the parking lot. I know a group of people screaming at someone isn't ""good behavior"" we were all suppose to be adults and talk but the fact that it made all of us so angry I think is a good thing.

I grew up in a baptist home and my dad is a baptist pastor. I was outed to my family and some people in the church this past October of 2012. While i'm still at home I've been in deep discussion with my dad on the Biblical stand piont on homosexuality. I identify myself as Christian and know how to apply the Bible properly as far as what I believe. Unlike many people who catagorize themselves as ""Christian"". I really like Matthew Vines lecture and have used this info as well as my own study to show my parents that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality. But I still need some help. Here is what I need answers to:

1. Are there any POSITIVE examples for homosexual relationships. Relationships between a man and a woman are clearly defined as right and also how to treat each other in a relationship. My position currently is that the Bible is neutral on homosexuality. It neither condemns nor vilifies it. 

2. Can someones inner core as a person (their sexual orientation) change. We know many people can change things about themselves but can their sexual orientation actually change. Matthew Vines says no but my dad says yes.

@@@@@#@@@@@@

Well theres this guy whos name is Jake. Me and Jake have been bestfriends since sandbox times. When we entered High School Jake came out of the closet but no one was really surprised. Our mutual friends and myself treated him the same and accepted him completly. In the middle of our senior year Jake conessed that he loved me more than a friend or a brother and was convinced that I was the ONE. Now after this our relationship tarnished. I was completly straight and had no intention of ""breaking on through to the other side"". Please understand this. I am actracted to women 100%. I can recognize if a guy is good looking but nothing at all physically attracts me about a man. Well when me and Jake stopped hanging out I sort of hit a depression. I felt terrible for allowing my best friend to leave my life simply because he loved me. I contacted him and it wasnt long before we were best friends again. However something had changed. Our bro time stadted turning into dates and started to become emotionally dependent on one another. I began to what I can only describe as fall in love with him and last night he kissed more for the first time and surprisingly enough I kissed him back. Now this is where im confused. Im not sure if I would be able to have a realtionship with Jake. I love more than anyone I know but im not attracted to him in that way. He looks great and works out a lot, but im not physically turned on by him. Is this normal? Can I learn to be with him? In your opinion would this work out? I love him but I dont want to chsnce this or rush anuthing. I obviously have to come out to my friends and family if this does turn into thing so it has to be something im sure of.

Just remember, everyone's situation is different, your coming out may not unfold like mine, and objects in mirror are closer than they appear.

I was born in 1970 and, yes, everything looked like it was filtered through Instagram. The 70's were an awesome time to grow up. Music was [fun](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2646/4205409684_b9d7f3663f.jpg), Superheroes were [everywhere](http://loyalkng.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/wonder-woman-1.jpg) and children were raised to be [peaceful](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2008/11/10/arts/television/magic.span.jpg).

Then the 80's arrived.

Pop culture tried to be more sophisticated and lost the sequens and sparkles and disco balls. Television in general started to be more open and honest and people like Phil Donohue began speaking openly about subjects once only whispered about. But when AIDS appeared on the scene, homosexuality went from a quiet cultural secret to a subject discussed on the evening news.

And that's how I found out I was gay.

Previous to this, I thought I was the only person in the world who was attracted to the same sex. NO ONE talked about it. Even if you're parents had ""the birds and the bees"" discussion with you, they left out that little factoid. So, I thought something was wrong with me. I thought, if my parents found out, they'd put me in an asylum. It terrified me -but I also couldn't deny my feelings. Then, one afternoon in 1983, I was playing with my legos in my room when a tv news woman explained AIDS (still called GRIDS, Gay Related Immune Deficiency Syndrome) and said, ""for those of you at home who don't know, a homosexual, or gay person, is someone who is sexually attracted to someone of the same sex."" 

I just stood there and stared at the screen. She was describing me. I wasn't the only one in the world. We had a name. And, as she went on to explain, people hated the shit out of us. Still, I had a sense of belonging and no longer felt alone. There wasn't something wrong with me after all.

As the months went by, I wanted to understand more. I tried the library and found some information, but not much. I certainly wasn't going to ask anyone. I went to a very small Episcopal private school (don't picture polo ponies and swimming pools, picture a 1950's style crewcuts-and-discipline boarding school minus the boarding). I was also very religious, as you might imagine, after spending nearly my entire life in parochial school. But, right down the street was a small convenience store that I frequented for my candy and gum. One afternoon, I wandered into the back area and found a hidden treasure trove of *all gay porn mags*. I was slack-jawed. Hot men graced the covers of dozens of slicks (what gay mags were called back then because their covers were shiny and slick, thick paper). I cautiously selected one as well as a newspaper and a puzzle magazine. I was absolutely terrified to bring it to the register. I slipped the mag between the newspaper and puzzle book, hoping no one would see it as I went to the counter. Remember, I was 13. i was shitting a brick at the counter as the fellow began ringing it up. He rang up the newspaper, making small talk, and moved it aside. He went silent. He looked at the magazine, then right into my eyes. He didn't say anything. He just rang it up and then the puzzle book. I paid my money, took the bag with my items, and absconded off home. Looking back, I can't help but find it amusing that the little shop down the lane from both my parochial school and the catholic church next door (to which me and my family belonged and where I went to sunday school) had a vast gay porn section. It was probably for the catholic church.

Needless to say, my masturbatory habits increased under the influence of limitless gay mags being available so close to home. But more importantly, and not to be cliche, I read the articles. I gained an understanding of being gay, coming out, politics, the gay communities around the country and so many things no one could have sat down and told me. I also got an eyeful of a sexuality I hadn't even dreamed up. I started getting into some of the leather mags too. I knew if my parents ever found my ever-increasing storehouse of porn I was truly doomed.

By 1984 I had come to understand myself and gayness well enough that I decided I had to start coming out. I couldn't take the lying and hiding and pretending. I couldn't just tell my mother and father right away, though -that was too frightneing. So, I tested the waters with a good friend. I remember the day vividly; it was cold and rainy in my small NY hometown and my friend and I were standing by the swings in the school yard. She and I were very close and I decided if anyone would accept me it would be her. So, I told her.

She told me it was a sin and I'd go to hell.

She said she'd keep my secret, and she did, and that she'd always be my friend, and she did -we are still friends to this day. But she shocked me. And I had never heard this notion that being gay was a sin. That afternoon, I sat in my religion class and brooded. I don't know how it happened, but someone mentioned it and I piped up and said that was a ridiculous notion. But the teacher said I was wrong, and promptly read the dreaded passage from Leviticus. I felt sick. I waited about 10 minutes, so as not to arouse suspicion, and excused myself to the boy's bathroom. I stood in a stall and cried my eyes out. How could God hate me for something I didn't do, didn't choose, and didn't hate? I felt very guilty and totally abandoned by God for quite a few years.

Still, I was going to be who I was, and decided I needed another test subject. My homeroom teacher was very much like my mother; both italian women around the same age with similar temperments. I arranged a private meeting with her and told her. I was absolutely terrified. In retrospect, I can't believe I told a teacher at a religious private school. She knew I had aspirations of being an actor and said, ""well, its something I was concerned about because theater attracts *those people*."" I didn't care for her tone. 

She tried to tell me that she thought the male penis was ugly and wondered how I could like that. I told her I thought it was beautiful. She said she hoped she'd never see me in a parade. I've walked in the pride parade of many cities for many decades since. But she didn't fly off the handle and she didn't smack me with the bible. She said she loved me anyway. I decided rehearsal was over, it was time to tell my mom.

My mother was sitting and folding laundry when her youngest son came to her and said, as awkwardly and self-righteously as a dumbass 14 year old could muster, ""I'm a homosexual."" Jesus, I couldn't have said Gay?

Well, she went berserk. My dry run with my teacher was a bust. My mom went positively orbital. ""You're WHAT? No you're not! You don't even know what that word means!"" I defined it for her. ""Its a phase! I'm telling you, its just a phase!"" She ranted and raved for some time and then said the dreaded words. ""What am I going to tell your father?!""

""Nothing,"" I said. ""I don't want him to know. Not yet."" Now, to this day, my parents have been married for exactly 60 years. They fell in love as teenagers and were married at 18. They eloped. They are approaching 80 now, and very ill. And they still hold hands. I've never known two people more in love than them. Its where I get my monogamousness from and my lfielong pursuit of true love. She'd never kept a secret from him in her life. But she kept mine. Maybe it was fear, maybe it was shame, I don't know -but she promised not to tell him and she didn't.

But the ensuing weeks were hard. She cried. She was depressed. She blamed herself. And she kept telling me it was just a phase. I couldn't take it. No boy wants to be the reason his mother cries. So, one day, as we were driving somewhere together, I told her, ""You were right mom, it was just a phase.""

She was delighted. ""See? I told you! Oh I'm so happy."" The words burned to hear. Me not being me made her happy. But she was happy and that was enough for me. At least I wouldn't feel like a total disappointment.

But I did decide to tell my oldest brother. I'm the youngest of 4 boys and while I'm farthest in age from my oldest brother I was always closest to him -and still am. I summoned up the courage -or at least tried to, and started to tell him. ""I have something to tell you. Its not easy for me to say,"" the usual pre-coming out preamble. He cut me off. 

""You're gay.""

I was stunned. We were driving together in his car and I stared at him in disbelief. ""How did you know?!""

He opened the glove compartment and pulled something out. He tossed it in my lap. I looked down. It was a gay slick. ""It takes one to know one.""

I was stunned. We were both gay. I was absolutely floored. Thereafter we spent a lot of time together. He took me to Fire Island for the first time and I got to see actual living, breathing gay people in a gay environment instead of photos of them in a magazine. He took me to the city and I spent time in the Village. I met dozens of gay men and got to ask all kinds of questions and silently observe *hot* men walking arm-in-arm together. It was incredible.

I remained quiet about it to my parents for a few more years. One day, I stumbled upon [Torch Song Trilogy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096289/) in my local video store (on VHS ;p) and decided to rent it. I was fairly masculine, or at least not feminine, so I didn't really relate to the drag-queen main character. But I related to what he had to say. And Anne Bancroft, who played his mother, somehow had managed to channel my own mother perfectly. Oh, her character was jewish and my mother is italian, but the differences are subtle at best. [This scene had a major impact on how I viewed myself as a gay man.](http://youtu.be/rOsH_pbfOV8?t=3m6s)

I had never heard anyone say things like this before. Prior to this, my exposure to gay men on Tv was Rip Taylor and Richard Simmons acting like buffoons. No one had ever dared to say I could be proud of who I was or that I didn't have to tolerate the intolerant. No one had told me I didn't have to be ashamed. Alas, by the end of the film, Arnold and his mother couldn't really repair their relationship. [This is how she left.](http://youtu.be/nCAxExyC69A?t=5m11s)

I couldn't stop crying. I didn't want that to be us. It took me a few hours of pacing in my room to decide I had to come out to her... again.

I sat down with her alone that night. Dad was already in bed. We talked about nothing for a while; the weather, my college plans, family stuff. It got quiet. I turned to her and said simply, ""Mom, do you remember what I told you when I was 14?""

She replied instantly and in a soft voice. ""I never forgot. ...Has anything changed?""

""Only my taste in men,"" I said with a sly grin.

""I figured. I've had a long time to think about this and I have a few things to say. First, you're my son, and I love you -nothing will ever change that. Second, God made you and He doesn't make mistakes. I don't care what the bible says. I love you and He loves you and don't even worry about what some stupid church says. I can't say I totally understand but I'll support you no matter what.""

It seems the seed I'd planted had bourne fruit in the intervening years. It hadn't been a mistake. It had given her time to think. And I don't think I've ever been more proud of my mom -or proud to be her son. Still, I didn't think dad would take it well. I asked her to continue to keep him in the dark. 

She did.

",greenmonster80,106,27,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/169x5q/my_bf_kissed_me_goodbye_and_said_i_love_you/,"I had asked him if he was happy a few days before, he told me he was super happy. No fights, nothing. That day I was sick, he layed with me playing with my hair and kissing me, then insisted I take a bunch of NyQuil so I could sleep while he went to do laundry. I didn't want to, even accused him of trying to knock me out jokingly. When I started to pass out he came in and kissed me, said 'I love you' and loaded his car, then came back in, layed with me awhile and kissed me and again told me he loved me then left. I woke up to a note saying 'Sorry to do it like this'. Took all the bill/rent money, money out of coat, winning scratch offs, etc and left me to be evicted two days later. No reason. No fight. No nothing. I can't handle this pain. It's been a week and it's just worse every day. He won't answer calls. Last I heard he was driving cross country with someone else. I'm homeless and broken hearted. I paid for everything and he took everything.  How do I deal with this? I can't. I just can't. Can't even function. Can't do anything. 

Edit: Update- Just talked to his best friend, he is in ATL, GA, trying to find a job which he's having a hard time with due to having dirty UA's and he didn't transfer certifications. Apparently the money he stole from me didn't get him to Florida where he was headed. He is alone and broke and it makes me so sad but also makes me feel a sense of justice. I was informed that he may come back but only if I don't ever mention this and let him party and do his drugs without complaint. FUCK.THAT. If he comes back it's my terms. Thanks Reddit, I finally found my anger after realizing he commited a criminal act while I did nothing but love him. I still hurt so bad, but I am going to hold this anger and ride it to safety.

At first people listened politely, but as she continued to speak and read from her bible she was approached by two ushers who intended to take her by the arm and escort her from the congregation.

These are the verses she read:

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your spices — mint, dill and cumin. But you have neglected the more important matters of the law — justice, mercy and faithfulness. You should have practiced the latter, without neglecting the former. You blind guides! You strain out a gnat but swallow a camel.” (Matthew 23:23-24)

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven in men’s faces. You yourselves do not enter, nor will you let those enter who are trying to.” (Matthew 23:13);

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to win a single convert, and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are.” (Matthew 23:15)


“Love your neighbor as yourself,” [said Jesus]. “There is no commandment greater than these.” (Mark 12:31)

She was asked not to return.  

I asked her why she did what she did.  She said ""When you get to be my age, you don't care much about what other people think.  If you are a good person, you do what's right.  I was just trying to do what's right.  I didn't want to go back there anyway.  The pastor is leading those people down the wrong path.  I did what I could to set them straight.""  She is my hero.

**TL;DR: My grandmother interrupted her anti-gay church service by reading bible verses. She was asked not to return.**

**edit: I read all your comments to my grandmother. She said ""It tickles me that so many strangers care about an old lady making a fuss in church on Sunday morning"".  She also says to tell my friends that ""Jesus loves them and made them the way they are for a reason, and not to let those hateful people make them feel bad."" She doesn't understand how Reddit works, and thinks that I actually know you all.  She also doesn't understand that many of you are atheists.  She said ""well, that may be, but Jesus still believes in them"".**

OK guys. I took all of your advice and I did come out to my friends. My friends supported me wholeheartedly. They love me for who I am and are the best friends I could ever have. I told one friend and she was absolutely fine with it. I know I can trust her, but at the end of school, it had spread like wild fire. Everyone knew I came out of the closet. No one made fun of me, and they all accepted me and loved me even more (because you know, some girls want gay best friends for some reason). Some of the guys know (which will make gym class a whole lot more awkward). But overall, everyone at my school accepted me as being gay.
But the thing is my parents. My sister is already homosexual, and my parents got over that after some years of thought. I came out to them both today since my mom was at the house today. They did not take it well at all. But after a few minutes, she seemed to understand and is loving me normally and helping me get through this. My dad though...my dad is ""old fashioned"" as he said himself, and he didn't believe it was right for me to be gay. He still loves me, and that's all I wanted to happen. He won't support anything I do for being homosexual, but when i'm 18, he says I can do whatever I want! Since this happened, he won't let me male friend I was talking about come over to my house anymore. He says that if I was heterosexual, he wouldn't have let me have girls over. Now that i'm homosexual, he won't let my friend come over anymore. It's really tough at the moment guys. I still have to go to my grandparents and tell them this. I just want them to accept me for the way I am and let me be happy the way I am. Thank you for all your support, guys.

And by chance, her favorite course is Rainbow Road, so I used that as a segway haha. 

I just started talking and I said, ""Liz, I have something to tell you and I think its fitting that I tell you while we're playing on Rainbow Road.""
And I rambled for what seemed like forever by telling a story and eventually I got to the part in the story where I said, ""..and that's when I was planning on coming out to you.  You know, like coming out of the closet.""

And she goes, ""Wait like...you're gay?"" To which I replied, Yeah....sooo what do you think of me now?

And without missing a beat she goes, ""And you thought this would change our relationship?""  So we talked about it and it turns out nothing is different in any way, except for the fact that I feel like an elephant has been lifted off my shoulders.

",OhioJunglist2,86,14,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/tjseb/dear_homosexual_community/,"Dear homosexual community at large,

There was a time, a year or so ago, when I felt I had to shun your lifestyle. It didn't feel right to me when I was doing it nor did I take an active role in promoting that sort of mentality. I simply believed you were wrong.

Why? Because I was trying to be a good Christian.

For that, I apologize, sincerely. I find it distasteful when I think about how I conflicted myself on thoughts about your community. I knew in my heart what I expressed to myself and to others when speaking on this topic(again, I never actively took a role in shunning your community, I would only admit that according to bible principle it was wrong and, in god's eyes, you were all to be condemned) was not what I truly believed or felt inside.

So, now that I have shrugged off the weight of religion and my thoughts have cleared, I would like to openly apologize to you in whole for how shallow I allowed myself to be. I have quite a few gay friends now and have enjoyed their thoughts and views on society. I believe that there is nothing different about a gay man except for how he chooses to express his love. I am sorry that the rest of our society cannot see what I now see.

I hope you will find room in your hearts to forgive my shallow and contemptuous behavior of the past and realize that I am more than happy to accept you into my life and will stand along side you if you ever need an ally.

Sincerely,

I gave him a soft kiss on his stomach then licked the head of his member. His moans, they're like drugs. I wanted more and more of them so I pulled out the big guns and went all out. Licking down the shaft. Sucking the head. Deep throating. Everything. The whole time, he was moaning quite loudly and clutching at the bed. He came after 10 minutes but I kept going.

Having been blessed enough to be born and raised in a family with absolutely liberal, tolerant and open views, I never had any issues regarding homosexuality (can't say the same thing about my father, he was raised a bit more traditionally but eventually in later life he quickly realised how dumb he had been), to me it was just and will always be just a normal and welcome condition of nature,just as there are apples and pears. 

But I also realise that many (if not all) of my own opinions and worldviews are just a result of the environment in which I was brought up,so in a sense, my mind is a lot like a robot programmed to react to stimuli following a pattern in which I was educated. In that sense, I could as well be a misogynistic homophobic had I been raised by a family of rednecks. 

When you are a straight, white male coming from a mid/high household income background, you will never in your entire life have to be confronted to any sort of discrimination (the only discrimination I face is holding a passport of a third-world country. Visa issues and the like). Your rights and well-being are taken for granted so you are not forced to evolve if you don't want to.

Now here is (what I believe to be) the most awesome thing about being gay: If you are gay and were born in a free-thinking family and/or live in a liberal city, consider yourself lucky, but even so, I guess you will eventually face some kind of discrimination; but even more admiring is if you have the disgrace to be born gay in a hostile/religious/repressive environment. Only then you can turn that weakness into an advantage. Because realising about your own ""abnormal"" sexuality in a hostile environment means that, unless you are a total dumbass with a life devoid of purpose, you will have to face, confront and internally debate every aspect of your own social environment and you will break yourself free from it. This is a gift that is mostly granted to gay people-until a day comes when everyone loves and respects everybody and we all hold hands together while John Lennon plays the guitar. But until that day comes, you are given the true gift of free will and that only makes you stronger and more human, while the rest of us ""normal"" people just follow the herd because sheep don't have any reason to struggle.

I don't know about you but I find that awesome, that aspect alone puts you on top of the world. 

Am I exaggerating?




**EDIT**: After reading some replies, I apologize for simplifying an issue that might seem ""awesome"" for an outside observant, where indeed it can be-and it sure will be, given the trade-off- a pretty awful experience.This does not have to be like that.

I had asked him a couple of days ago if he had time to talk. Close to midnight, (last night) he sent me a text saying yea he had some time now. I didn't want to keep waiting to tell him anymore even though it was over texts. So I told him how I felt for him, and luckily his reaction was nice. He wrote something like: You just have to understand that I don't have the same feelings for you and there is never going to be a relationship like that between us. Though we can continue to be friends :) 
After that message I had a little tear running down my face. I was so happy he took it the way he did. That we can still be friends made happy. We'll see each other on Tuesday though (oral exams...) so maybe we can talk a bit about it face to face there. 
Anyways I wanted to thank you for the help you gave me :)  I also thought the story was worth telling.

But it changed when I met someone who was around my age, and pretty much felt the same way I do, with him it was the first time I ever actually slept with another guy (literally, I stayed the night) and felt no shame, didn't feel uncomfortable, it felt natural.

Since then, I have been able to enjoy myself when the time arises, and have even been contemplating starting to announce to people that I am gay. Even the possibility of a relationship sounds nice. (Even though that may sound selfish of myself since I am still closeted, and try to be discreet).

1329505209.0,60,self.gay,pu7si,Is it possible to be gay for just one guy?,concaution,68,8,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/pu7si/is_it_possible_to_be_gay_for_just_one_guy/,"Context: I am a 17-year old son of two gay dads. My upbringing has been healthy, I have no pre-conceived notions regarding other people and whatever their ethnicities/beliefs/preferences are. I am a very open-minded person, so to speak.

I firmly believe that I am straight. Given the environment I've lived in, I think I'd figured out by now if I'm into girls or guys (or both). I don't think I'm in a state of denial (emphasis on ""I think"", I'll hear out what you guys think), because if I were gay, I'd still receive the same amount of love and support from the people around me. And I think my gay dads would be happier (it's sort of a joke, that me being straight is a ""disappointment""). They always said that it would be great if I just dated my best friend, because we look ""cute"" together.

Which brings me to my point. I have a guy best friend (we're both 17, he's older by a couple of months) who I've known for years. He came out to me when we were 14, and he was so happy I didn't find it ""weird"" to be friends with him. If anything, we grew closer after that. We hung out more, he became less introverted, he talks about more stuff now other than COD and Skyrim. He tries to talk me about guys, but sometimes I feel uncomfortable (especially when things turn graphic, he can be vulgar lol), but I listen to him anyway. Once I asked him if he would date me if I was gay. He was like, no, I'd marry you, and then he laughed really ugly.

Until recently, I've always thought of him as a brother, as cheesy as that sounds. But the problem is I've been having mixed feelings about him lately. He's gone away for a trip, and the only thing I'm waiting for is when we can skype next. It's only been a day since he left. This isn't the first time I've missed him though. I could chalk it up to feeling the same way as a brother would for his sibling, but I feel like that's not really it. There's just way too many things aside from that that makes me think I'm in love with him.

Don't get me wrong, I have no problem admitting that. But as far as sexual attraction goes, I'm all for boobs and vaginas. I've experimented with gay porn before, but I felt so awkward the whole time, and I never got hard. I've also tried looking at other guys, but I feel no attraction (sexual or otherwise) towards them.

I do feel that way exclusively for my best friend though. I thought it was pretty harmless at first, I definitely didn't fantasize about kissing him or sleeping with him before. I just like being around him and being protective of him. But recently I've been having the most sexual dreams about him. It lead me to experiment again and, uh, try to relieve myself to gay porn, but it's still a no go. But when I fantasized about us doing, well, things together, that sure did it (and it was embarrassingly quick). And it wasn't so much that I imagined what it feels like to have sex with him as me wanting to be intimate with him. I think what got me off easy was the fact that I felt so close to him, like there was a feeling of deeper connection (pun not intended).

Which brings me to my question (and several follow-ups). Is it possible to be gay for one guy? Am I straight? Bisexual? Gay? Should I tell him about it? I feel like I'm being unfair claiming that I'm straight but I'm attracted to him. There are a lot of scary thoughts going through my mind right now, and the biggest one is that I might screw up our friendship.

I know I'm young and I still have a long ways to go, and maybe I'll figure out things later on, but I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter.

**EDIT 1:** So idk if this is an update but i thought of asking my dads about it. i thought it was a good idea, but turns out they're no help because all they did was laugh and pat me on the back and say ""*finally*"" then they said i already probably know what to do i'm just not owning up to it or something, they're being rather cryptic :(

also i'll be talking to my best friend tomorrow. please pray for my soul lol

**EDIT 2:** Finally got to talk. I could've probably executed my speech better, but nerves got to me and I ended up, well, let's just say i stuttered a lot? he didn't say anything for a while, but then just when i was about to wordvomit ""loljok nvm i was just kidding when i told you i love you *love you* ten minutes ago"" he said it would be better for us to be just friends *for now* at least. broke my heart to pieces, not even going to lie. we're still hanging out tomorrow though, crossing my fingers that i don't feel too sad and awkward. ugh fml.",,False,self,t5_2qhef,True,,,True,t3_pu7si,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/pu7si/is_it_possible_to_be_gay_for_just_one_guy/,

I'm a closeted gay man who works at a gas station with a restaurant attached. My brother (who is openly gay) used to work at the restaurant, but got a promotion a few years back and has been climbing the ""corporate ladder"" ever since. I will call him ""P""
   When I got the job, my coworkers quickly realized that P and I were brothers, which is great. Helps break the ice and make conversation, especially since most of them thought he was a great guy. I started working with this guy who worked for the gas station while my brother was employed next store all the time. This coworker has a lot of problems, he's really negative and lazy with an alcohol problem. He loves playing warcraft and skyrim. He's the kind of guy to talk about every girl that walks in to the store.
   So, I would make small talk about video games, cars or whatever else I knew he was into.  Somehow, we got on the topic of my brother the other day. We talked about P's personality a little and I brought up a few stories from when were kids. Out of nowhere he said; ""So how's that faggot doing?"" Not sure how to react I snapped and said; "" Faggot? That faggot, or my brother P, is making 50k a year with amazing benefits and perks. That faggot P has a positive outlook for the future. That faggot doesn't have a drinking problem so bad, that he has to beg customers for tips. That faggot doesn't sit at home playing skyrim with nude mods attached like a pervert. P enjoys his life regardless of what other people think. What about you? Where are you in life? Do you have any ""problems"" that you want pointed out?"" He didn't know what to say, so I walked out and took my break. The rest of the day it was really awkward. He didn't talk and tried to avoid me when possible.
I realized later it was a little harsh, but the point was made, and he stopped making fun of people (at least in front of me). While I was never one to join in on the ""fun"" of making fun of people, this situation made me realize I should be sticking up for them more. He eventually apologized after the manager found out and almost fired him. While I accepted his apology, I told him; ""No one is perfect. No one likes being ostracized for their choices or beliefs, that's why I follow the golden rule. My brother's sexuality is none of your concern, and your problems are not mine. I don't hate you, I have no problems with your choices. I only brought them up to prove a point.  Try respecting people for being different and you may enjoy life a little more.""
We really didn't talk much after that, but I think he definitely learned from his mistake. Shortly after, I came out to my mom and brother (which was amazing!) and I plan on fully coming out in the near future.

What do you think?
Thanks for reading!

I'm a fellow hetero Brazilian, and our Country is (hopefully) moving towards into marriage equality. It is going to be on vote soon in the congress.



Rede Globo, the biggest television network (and kind of homophobic I would say) opened a poll in their website, asking if you are in favor our against it. You can find it here: http://g1.globo.com/brasil/enquete/voce-e-favor-da-uniao-gay.html



At the moment it is going pretty bad, lots of votes to be against (Não), instead of in favor (Sim). One of the biggest problems of it is that you can vote thousands of times in it if you want, so I guess some guys are just saying No non-stop. Could you guys give a little help here?

The poll will run up to 22h UTC -3. Please vote (not asking to do non-stop, one would help) and share with as many people or other Gay Subs there is here).

I'm hetero, but not an idiot. And I would like to apologize for the behavior of all these close-minded people.",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_1c5dvd,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1c5dvd/poll_for_gay_marriage_in_brazil_going_very_badly/,

There is so much support here and I love it.  I've struggled with who I am for a while and it just feels like...you guys get it.  I would talk to my brothers about it, but I don't want to feel like, I don't know, I dont' want to like..overgay them haha.  Now I feel like I'm overgaying you guys.  I'll end it soon I guess.

After reading all your stories, I think I'm definitely ready to start accepting who I am and slowly coming out to everyone.  It just made me realize that there's nothing wrong with me, and because of you guys I feel so great about myself.

I don't exactly know where the fuck this is going, I'm just pissed off and this is the only place I can think of where I can say what I want. So I've been seeing stuff all over the place about homosexuality not being 'normal' and it's been pissing me off, but I've always managed to suppress it and move on, but about five minutes ago I saw a photo of a letter sent by a father to his gay son, the guy disowned his son for coming out, what I read was disgusting and hurt me to read. It set me off so much, I can not believe the hate some get for being gay. What the fuck is wrong with people? How can a father disown their son for something like that? It makes me sick to the core, I plan on having kids some day, when that day comes I will raise my children to realise that being gay is as normal as anything else in the world, I don't care if they are or aren't gay! I will accept and support them with whoever they decide to be! If one day my son or daughter tells me that they are gay, BRILLIANT! I will tell them I love them and that nothing could ever change that, I will tell them that I am proud of them for being their own person and being open about it. Fuck! I might even cry! People's stupidity, ignorance, hate, prejudice, it disgusts me! Why should gay people be treated any differently to straight people?!

To say I was shocked is an understatement, but talking through it with him over a midnight dinner really put me at ease that this was a) for real, and b) a long time overdue. Frankly, I'm proud of the guy, and as I said, the only thing that this changes for me is that I'll stop trying to set him up with women.

I'm the first person he's told, and he plans to tell his friends and family in stages over the coming days. His friends will be supportive. We're all film/theater people in a progressive city. His family will be more of a mixed bag, and we'll try to react to their reactions as they come in. 

And then there's The Guy, the one who made him realize this was something that couldn't be ignored, the ""camel that broke the straw's back,"" as we've come to call him. He's out, and they've been spending a lot of time together, under the assumption that my friend was straight. My friend plans to tell The Guy on Monday. I really have no idea what to expect. Is he at a disadvantage because he's never been with a dude before? Will that freak The Guy out? 

My friend is an organized guy, and has strategized this down to drafting out the Facebook post he plans to post on Tuesday. We both know things will go awry, but we'll do our best. Is there any advice I can get from people who've gone through this? What's the best way to be supportive? Any tricks of the trade or lingo I should know? I've been trying to bone up on my Dan Savage, but this is all a little out of my depth.

I'm a 20 year-old university student, and since my sophomore year of high school I've become more and more attracted to the same sex.

I had a consistent girlfriend of three years until October '11.  When I told her my feelings towards a certain friend, she left me and I felt even less sure of my feelings and myself.  I want to be with him, I've been talking to him for years, but I feel like it would destroy my friendships with old amigos, my father, and although I am not Christian, with a theistic God.  I feel like my feelings are wrong and I should fight them, but I want to be with him even though it's what destroyed my happy relationship.

I'm sorry for the long post, but I've been conflicted for a very long time and have nowhere to turn.  I have faith in reddit (however misguided) and hope some understanding people can help me understand.

Thanks so much.

Edit : 

*Hey guys.  I really appreciate the support, I haven't felt this confident in my sexuality in... EVER!  If anyone has any questions about my life or beliefs (I love debating:)  Reply or send me a pm.  This is officially my primary reddit account thanks to r/gay.*

Edit #2:

Hey guys, sorry i've been away from reddit lately, i've been extremely busy with work.  Many of you have inspired me to be more self accepting, althought I still don't feel comfortable with opening up to my close friends and family.  If any of you have any words of wisdom PM me, this post if gettings a little crowded.

Last day I was studying at my boyfriend's house when I opened the secontary browser (he usually uses Chrome and I thought I could use Safari so I wouldn't break his privacy) and the last results showed only porn. Gay porn at least. I then looked the browser history and all I found was porn. Every single one of the pages he visited. Like every two days even when we meet. I was looking for respecting his privacy and I ended up using his porn-only browser.

I know this is a normal thing. I myself use this kind of sites quite often and I think everyone does. What bothers me is the fact that he usually is very reluctant to having sex. He has this imaginary schedule; never after eating, never in the afternoon, nor in the morning, etc. So basically quite boring when it comes to sex and quite unwilling to have it just when I feel like doing it. So finding that he usually watches porn almost every day and some days even more than once or twice is really bothering me.

For instance, today I came back to his and he was studying, but I couldn't help but looking again in the browser history. Surprise, he had just been watching porn! I mean he knew I was coming and yet he did it. I really wouldn't mind it if it wasn't that later I tried to have sex with him and he said to me he had no time and he had to sudy. Really?

I know watching porn is not bad in a relationship, I'd say is good, but I feel like this time is interfering with our private life. **What do you think?**

**TL;DR** my boyfriend watches porn every day while he's unwilling to have good sex with me. My penis is depressed because of this.

Edit: **thank you very much for your advice**. I'll try to speak to him about it and I'll have in mind everything you said. Thank you Reddit!",,False,self,t5_2qhef,1369905430.0,,GaFlair,True,t3_1fb1au,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1fb1au/so_i_found_my_boyfriends_porn/,

""Hey dude, love you no matter who you are! :D"" That pretty much made my life. All these years I was afraid of her response...I feel a little silly to say the least. After she got home from work she sat me down and we talked. She wanted to know if the reason I've struggled with depression was because I tried to fight my sexuality. I told her that wasn't why, and if anything, that is one thing in life I was most proud of. Then she bought me ice cream. Yay! :)

After finding out my mom thought I was having sex with a girl I'm friends with, I had the ballsiest, rainbowiest fit of courage on the planet a proceeded to write out a 3 page coming out letter to her. Moments ago I put it in her car, locked the door, and didn't look back. By the time I wake up tomorrow I will officially be entirely out of the closet...which is a really strange for me to say considering last night I had no idea this would be it...I feel almost invincible. And surprisingly, I'm not concerned in the slightest that she'll have a negative reaction.

I know this post is kind of mundane, but I just wanted to thank you guys for giving me a sense of community for once.

It took something very important to get me out of the shadows. Your attention and consideration could save lives. Thank you in advance. 
 
I am not gay, but my dear friend is. He is incredibly successful, respected and a wonderful, moral human being. He has donated blood over a dozen times, but recently found himself on a ""can not donate"" registry because he is gay.

You might not realize, but it is illegal for gay men to donate blood in the United States because of outdated regulations dating from the beginning of the AIDs outbreak.
 
Of course we have discovered that AIDS is not exclusive to gays. Furthermore, we have the technology to scan for blood born viruses, including AIDs. 

Again, as a straight male I believe that if gay men cannot donate blood then no one should be allowed to donate blood. The Red Cross agrees, and is trying to lift this regulation but is bounded by outdated laws. 

The friend I spoke of earlier started this petition and posted to Facebook, which is where I saw it. He only needs 50 more signatures to reach his goal. He does not know the power of reddit to create positive change. I figure I would would help show him. 

Again blood is vital to the survival of many hospitalized people. If we can enact this change we WILL save lives. 

The petition is here, http://www.change.org/petitions/the-fda-allow-gay-men-to-donate-blood-2

It is easy to sign - takes less than a minute.

Thank you for your consideration and attention.

We've got to think bigger than that.  SLAVERY was a state matter until an amendment sanctioned it to be unjust saying that it denied civil rights. It took a federal law to change the mind of the country as a whole.  The excuse of leaving a civil matter like this down to state laws is regressive and will never take the country as a whole forward in civil equality.  At the moment, it's a total mess.

Is it fair that your straight daughter has different rights than your gay son?  Imagine that Maggie (my sister) got this new job of hers in Georgia and she had a female partner that she had married (in a state where they could) ... when they move to Georgia suddenly they'd have no civil partnership rights.  Is that fair?  She'd have no rights to decide what to do in the hospital, no rights to say what happens if her partner died, no automatic rights to inherit assets to help look after their baby?  (And let's not even start on adoption laws). These are all automatic inalienable rights for straight people.  This simply can not be left down to state opinion if the country is going to progress socially.  

What you think is 'right' is one matter and of course you're free to your opinion, but in the end that opinion should not impose itself on others.  Civil rights are another matter - cut and dried.  Gay people just want equal rights and to get on privately and live their lives.

I originally released it to gaybros and gaymers, but now that it has been tested a little more, I thought I would post it here to get a larger tester base. It is only known to /r/gay, /r/gaymers and /r/gaybros at this point, so you'll get someone from within those groups.

The site is now live, but in beta. That means there may be issues, all I ask is you tell me about them! All you have to do is go to http://blog.pruittlife.com and login with your google email. Then, expand the pen pals section and click Request a new Pen Pal. That is it, then just wait to be paired up. I don't know how long it will take for you to get a pen pal, but it all depends on how many people are interested. 

Let me know how it goes and what you want implemented or fixed. I don't know how fast I can get to things, though, as I am a over-worked grad student. (It is also completely open source)


**Feature Requests**

Warn/Ban System *Implemented, you can warn your pen pal (but only once) If you reach the warn threshold, you won't be able to submit an entry to anyone or request a new penpal*

Move Rename to PenPal Page *Implemented, See top of penpal page*

WikiFormatting Similar to Reddit *Implemented PHP Markdown (similar to reddit posts)*

Age Brackets for PenPals *Implemented. Give YOB and a range. Small ranges may take longer to match up*

Updated login mechanisms to make things a little more secure *Let me know if I broke something*

You can now delete pen pals *This will post a message automatically to the page saying the user has left and it will not show up anymore in your side bar*

**Note** There are triggers that will cause you to become auto-blocked besides just warnings. (i.e. requesting multiple pen pals and using different years of birth every time)

I just thought I'd share my little tale with you all, as proof that sometimes, things really do turn out okay with these 'coming out' dramas.

I came out to my parents when I was 18. From about 15-17, I'd had one or two girlfriends, with whom I'd gone through the motions - hanging out, chatting, kissing occasionally, but I just put it down to my own social awkwardness and geeky nature that I'd never thought to go any further than the peck-on-the-lips kissing. 

Then, not long after my 17th birthday, I met, and started talking to, a guy in a furry chatroom. Within the year we were dating, and to this day, we still are - infact, we've been living together for the past 6 years or so *(since I started University and got a flat with him in the Uni's city)*, and it's going great.

Now, the 'problem' in this story arose when I actually came out to my family, which was all of a month after I started dating my now-fiancé. I came out to my parents relatively early, because I was confident they'd be supportive, and thankfully, they were - my mom was apparently shocked and cried a bit when she found out *(I wasn't around when Dad told her)* but she quickly recovered and accepted it was who I was, and told me directly that she still loved me just the same, which was awesome to hear and helped me along a lot. My brothers also accepted me easily, as did their respective partners *(both female, as my brothers are both straight)*, although the younger of them, who I'd lived with for much of our joint lives at our parents' house, did do his bit to tease me for it in that brotherly-love kinda way :P

The sad point came when I found out that my Uncle *(my sister-in-law's dad)*, a man who I was quite fond of and very friendly with, wouldn't be attending the family christmas at my oldest brother's house. The reason being that he'd found out I was gay. I was, needless to say, both shocked and upset to find out he'd acted like that.

The blow was softened significantly when my sister-in-law explained that he didn't hate me - but having grown up himself in Brighton, one of the UK's most gay-heavy cities, with regular pride parades and the like, he had seen the very flamboyant, in-your-face side of the gay community, and as much as anything, he was afraid he'd do or say something to offend me and ruin the christmas experience for everyone. I explained to her that I didn't care - I'm not a 'stereotypical' gay guy, and thus far I've not found a gay joke I didn't find funny, but apparently this didn't take.

For the next 3 years, the family had two seperate Christmas Day celebrations - one with myself, my partner, my brothers and their partners, my parents and my Nan *(my mum's mum)*, and a second one with my sister-in-law's parents and her own biological family. It wasn't the way she wanted it, or I, but it sufficed to keep everyone happy.

And now the good bit.

Last year, in March to be precise, I recieved a phone-call from my sister in law asking if I and my partner would be available to join them, along with my mum *(my dad having passed away two years previously)* and my nan, for an Easter BBQ and egg-hunt for their kids. I said yeah, of course we would, and on the day, my mother drove the three of us down to my sister in law's place for the planned event.

What I wasn't expecting was, when I walked out into the garden where the food and drinks were arranged for the picking, was my Uncle, sat on the grass and being instructed on the finer points of my youngest niece's newest doll by said niece. I looked at my sister in law with a raised eyebrow and before I could say anything, she called out to her Dad to tell him I and my partner had arrived.

It was at this point that he proceeded to do the bravest and most humbling thing I have ever seen a man do; which is to walk up to his gay nephew (me!), hold out his hand and apologise, infront of the entire assembled family, for his behaviour, admit he shouldn't have made everyone go to such lengths to help him avoid facing what he feared, and ask if I would forgive him. I didn't even hesitate in doing so, because god only knows I love my uncle like I love any member of my family and I was glad to see the split over and done with, but to this day I'm still proud to say that I bore witness to a member of the older generation bridging the gap and admitting they were wrong.

Suffice to say I'll be inviting the humble old sod to my wedding, as and when it happens.

So yeah. It doesn't always turn out crappy. :)",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_ztqps,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/ztqps/a_story_for_your_pleasure_gay/,

But.

The way he dresses when he goes out with us, for example shopping or out for dinner, is just provocative: skin tight shorts for example. If one our nieces dressed equivalently (ie wore a super short miniskirt going out with us) we'd feel similarly uncomfortable: fortunately none of them ever has. It's the sort of dress that would be at the more, adventurous, end of the spectrum for clubbing.

I'm a 16 year old from very rural Australia. Throughout my childhood, I was a mousy brown haired, buck toothed, blue eyed, scrawny kid with really bad skin. That was up until I was about 15. In all, I was pretty damned ugly.

I was always an outcast. That wasn't helped by the fact i'm gay. I had to develop a pleasant personality. I was (and still am) a massive nerd and spent a lot of time on schoolwork and worked really hard to try to be the best.

At 15, I started putting effort into my appearance. [Now I look like this](http://imgur.com/a/oisIi)

**Thats the context out of the way.**

My last two boyfriends, whom I loved dearly both said this to me upon our breakup
&gt;""You will never find someone that sees you as more than a pretty face.""

**Now to my point**

As someone who is attracted to a personality in a guy, I regularly date people that most others find less than attractive because they have amazing personalities.

* I would like to ask, do any of you date anyone simply for the fact that they are attractive? 
* Are you dating someone because of their personality, though you aren't attracted to them?
* What is your view on superficiality; Human condition, or something you learn?
* Has someone ever said something similar to you?

I was at a party and we were smoking weed when the cops came. I was busted with a gram. I was fined 400 dollars, lost my license, was evicted from my apartment, and my parents cut me off financially as well as taking away my car. Luckily I had gotten on Grindr a week before the encounter with the cops and after a drunken one night stand, I had accidently been hired at a restaurant as a cook and three days before I was to be officially cleared of my old apartment, I met a guy in Craigslist who let me take over part of a sublease. Since January, I've been living with these consequences as well as being gay in a small college town in Mississippi. To support myself and pay off the ticket I've been working the restaurant job as well as doing below minimum wage slave labor on Amazon Mturk and that leaves me with less then 30 bucks a month once I factor in rent and utilities. Without a car and my college being ten miles away, I rode my bike 20 miles a day to get to and from class on dangerous badly paved roads and its a miracle I wasn't hit by a redneck until March when my lawyer finally got my suspension revoked 3 months early and my parents gave my car back. During all of this, I suffered through severe depression and suicidal thoughts that I hadn't felt since before I came out to myself. My grades and class attendance took a hit and I hit the bottle pretty hard. On top of all that, I've been struggling to escape Mississippi for the past two years and in April, I heard back from a college in Washington DC that accepted my application for transfer as long as I completed my Associates in Arts degree by the end of this summer. Putting the liquor aside, I focused hard on work and school and last week I took my finals. I got 3 A's, 1 B, and 1 D, the D (In Chemistry) still counts as passing, and I got a schedule lined up for the summer that will get me my A.A. Though I am still living paycheck to paycheck and on a diet of ramen and toast, I feel uplifted and saved. Ive kept my nose clean and up for expungement this June plus im taking four classes this summer and I am free of this hillbilly nightmare and today (Mothers Day) I get to see my family for the first time in nearly 2 months after a quick lunch shift and five hour drive and tell them I've made it. They actually told me to drop out of college but I refused to do that and I've had to sacrifice quite a bit just to make up for all of this and be able to secure my future outside of the South. This story and my problems may seem trivial (and self inflicted) to quite a few readers but this morning all I can think is how great it will feel when I cross the state line and never have to return and if I can overcome these troubles, then I hope someone out there can read this and take hope that things will get better for you too. 

TL;DR: I almost fucked up my entire future but I persevered through hard times. Take hope and know that you can make it too as my story proves your own worst enemy is yourself.",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_1e6dhq,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1e6dhq/it_just_got_better_just_got_through_a_difficult/,

[nsfw],hatemysexuality,52,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/177xsu/i_hate_my_sexuality_i_am_the_worst_kind_of_closet/,"Sometimes I wish I could just chop my dick off. I hate my sexuality. It gets me into trouble a lot, puts me in dangerous or awkward situations and might be a root cause of my divorce emotionally. 

I love women. I'm attracted to women. I have a dark side that wants to abuse, humiliate, and dominate women. That part I'm kind of okay with. I've never found a girl to dom, but I can live with that.

I'm not attracted to men, or how they look. I've never thought a guy was cute or attractive. I definitely wouldn't kiss a guy. Sounds pretty straight, right? Oh boy...

I'm a submissive pig. I sit around and day dream about guys forcing their cocks down my throat and slapping me around.  I have ever since I was little. I hate it, I hate wanting this. 

A few times I've actually gone through with meeting guys. They were always one night stands. It's dangerous, you put yourself up for risk to disease. On top of that, I get what I ask for. Really hard abuse. Gagging for air, being hit so hard I don't know which way is up or down. I never like it while it's happening, and the cravings always subside as I continue to hate myself for the next few weeks.

Then it happens.... I get horny for it again. 

I can't talk to anyone about this. Sometimes when I get the cravings my sex drive for women goes completely flat and I lose interest in any women in my life. The rest of the time I'm normally a horn ball for them.

This is really dangerous behavior. I don't want to end up meeting the next Jeffrey Dohmer (spelling) or similair homicidal gay maniac that likes submissive men. I'm scared I'm going to get myself seriously hurt, killed, kidnapped, or given a nasty disease like HIV or another STD. 

I don't understand myself, or my sexuality. It's hard. I almost live some sort of double life. I still desire the company and love of a monogamous relationship with a woman, but... these demons inside of me.

I'm 15 and yesterday I stayed at a friends house. (He has a girlfriend, but claims to be bisexual)
Somewhere around 1AM we wanted to buy a milkshake, so we went out, took our bicycles and started cycling to the Mc Donalds. They didn't have chocolate flavoured milkshakes anymore, so we went to a snackbar which was near. It was unfortunately closed. We started to make some jokes like: ""If we can find a shop which is still open and sells chocolate flavoured milkshakes, I'll give you a blowjob.

After cycling through our city for 1.5 hours, we got to the Burger King and we had our milkshakes. Then, we decided to go home again.

We watched some episodes of the Breaking Bad and during that he started to lie against me. Just after the third episode finished, he asked me about the jokes we made that night. I said to him that I still had to think about it, but he started rubbing 'it'.

So a few minutes later we kissed and blowjobbed (nice new verb ) each other and, well... you might think of the rest of the story. I won't tell you all the details.

We stopped at 5AM and slept until 2PM.

It literally made me bi. 

I got curious and made an ad, got lots of horny responses but i found someone who looked to be normal and we set a date for the next day.

I was super nervous as i made my way over but excited all at the same time. I'm 23 meeting an older divorced man in his late 50's. He greeted me at the door and we did some small talk over a beer. i told him about myself and i learned he was a professor at a local university. If it wasn't kinky enough...

I sat finishing my beer trying to bring up the real reason i was there when he finally asked me if i wanted to go upstairs to the bedroom. I smiled and nodded as i felt the butterflies in my stomach. We walked up and as we got into the room he turned to me and kissed me.

I've never kissed a man and honestly, had not expected this as part of the deal. I was only interested in oral but being in the moment and considering we got along.... I kissed back. 

It was ok, he seemed to get into it and rubbed my ass as he moaned into my face. We stood embracing in the middle of the room as we took our clothes off. I looked down and saw i was already rock hard. He was kissing my neck when his underwear dropped and i saw he was hard too.

We gently kissed as we tiptoed toward the bed and i layed ontop getting more into the kissing. I enjoyed the tickle of his moustach and began kissing down his chest and belly when i saw his cock.

Here goes nothing i thought and holding with one hand i licked the head of his penis and brought it into my mouth. He was uncut and tasted clean. Up and down i slurped his cock in a nice slow pace. I could begin to taste the salty precum and it made me more horny.

It felt great, i loved the feeling of seeing him moan. I tried to mimic the same things l like in a blowjob. I could tell i was doing a good job when his touch and kiss began to get more tender. We both got into the bed and as i lay on my back he mounted me into 69. I slurped away and he went to town on my already throbbing cock. We would break, kiss, suck and repeat. 

We got into 69 when he finally blew his load right down my throat. I never even saw it. He finished me off asking to cum in his mouth at the end. It was wild. We cuddled for a bit after, had another beer and i left to go back home. 

I wanted reddit to hear my story. May have found a new mature friend... Anyone else have a similar expience with someone older or same age?

I had an awesome casual encounter with a old university professor ( im a 23 college student) as my first gay experience.

I need to get this out. I'm a white male, 47, married 21 years to a wonderful woman, worked hard my whole life. I'm socially liberal, never been homophobic, have had gay friends, etc. I've had someone come on to me before and was polite but adamant. That just isn't what I do. I'm not gay. But something has happened and now? 

Two years ago I had a stroke. I was very confused for a week or 2 and still find my brain acting strange on occasion. But I recovered. My personality seemed unchanged. And it was for awhile. Ok, so I was impotent now but that happens you know, might get better, might not. But I could still feel pleasure and get an orgasm. Just no erection. 

I started to notice weird things were turning me on. Weird for me anyways. I was seeing erotic undertones in movie dialog between males that wasn't there. I think I was making them up subconsciously and inserting them, I started to fantasize. About men. And it was hot.

This left me scared and confused. I have never had thoughts like these. I started reading story's. Watching porn. I still liked straight porn too. But I'm not sure which I prefer at this point?

So I told my wife. She thinks I've been a little rewired by the stroke. It happens. She's not angry or hurt or anything. She is a saint. Thats why I married her. But now I wonder what to do from here. I have no social circle to speak of. And none of the few friends I do have would be very understanding of my situation.

I don't know if there is a point to all this or not. But I had to tell someone if only to accept it's real myself.I guess AMA if you want.

We had spent every free minute together and were the best of friends, surely he'd accept me. 

He didn't.

His exact words were, ""don't call me, don't come to my house, don't sit next to me at lunch, and don't talk to me in class. You're twisted."" And he meant it. For the entirety of senior year he would not say one word to me except for two instances. Once to tell me all gay people should be put on island to die and again to tell me I was sick. It absolutely destroyed me. However, as I told more of my friends, they turned out to accept me -and reject him for being an asshole. It taught me that some people you're sure will accept you may not -and those you are sure won't just might. You never know when you come out to someone. It lets you know who your real friends are.

After graduation, I moved across the country to go to university and only got home but once a year for christmas. While there, I decided it was like a life do-over and this go I'd start out as an openly gay young man. I joined the Gay and Lesbian Association for Student Support, or GLASS. It was my first time meeting other gay young people without my brother around. It was frightneing, to be honest. I didn't know if they'd be friendly or if they'd like me or not. I was very nervous. But in time, we came to all be friends and it was a very positive experience for me. The leaders of the group taught us about safer sex, for one thing, and helped us deal with the social stigma we suffered that was very different from how things are today. Some states still had sodomy laws. Nowhere could you marry legally. And positive public opinion of us polled far, far lower than it does today. 

In my second year of college, my mom kept asking me to tell my father. Keeping this from him was killing her. But I remembered the day, when I was about 15, that my dad and I were watching TV and they showed the Pride parade in NYC on the news. Dad was always a big hunter and fisherman, and he pointed to the shotgun on the wall. ""If one of my kids ever told me they were one of them, I'd pull that shotgun down off the wall and kill myself."" That was the extent of our discussion on the topic.

So, I told her I just couldn't. She insisted. It turned into a very heated argument. She threatened me. I told her in anger, ""Look, if you think its so damned easy, *you* tell him!"" She vowed she would.

For weeks afterwards I kept asking her on the phone if she had told him. ""I still haven't found the right time."" I laughed. ""Two weeks and no time? See... it isnt easy, is it?"" She got quiet. ""No, it isn't."" I told her, ""look, I don't think he needs to know. Just let it go."" But she wouldn't. Within a few days... she told him.

Now, ""she told him,"" really doesn't cover it. You have to know my melodramatic mother. According to my brother, she was sobbing crying when dad came home from work that day and he went pale, asking, ""what is it?! What's the matter?!"" She couldn't answer, she only cried. Dad assumed one of us, me or my brothers, was dead. He asked her if it was me. She nodded. ""Is he dead?!"" She shook her head. ""He's gay.""

Thanks mom, I could have done that. If I had wanted to break it to him like a cancer diagnosis I could have just shown him the porn magazines or fucked someone on his bed. What killed me though? My ex navy, construction worker, tough as shit father, who didn't cry at his own father's funeral...cried. 

Still, my mom called me and told me she had told him -and said, ""your father wants to speak to you."" This phrase was usually reserved for an ass kicking, so I was absolutely terrified. He sounded terrible. But what he said has stuck with me for my entire life.

""Yeah. Your mom told me. You didn't have to be afraid to tell me. I'm your father. You're my son and I still love you, and nothing can ever change that.""

I instantly burst into tears, kind of like I have now as I write this. Of course, a moment later he said, ""...and God willing, one day it'll go away.""

I laughed through my tears. ""Its not the flu, dad.""

""Yeah, I know. Its ok. Here's your mother.""

He handed back the phone and that was that. We didn't speak about it again for a very long time.

Fast forward out of the 80s...past the 90s... and its the year 2000. Y2k was the mayan prediction of the Oh's and 9/11 hadn't happened yet. My brother, who had been in the closet and married a woman and had children because he, as an older gay man than I, felt being an out gay man was an impossibility -came out of the closet. He and wife amicably divorced and are still best friends. And then...so did another of my brothers. Three of the four of us are gay. We tell our one straight brother that its ok that he's straight; every family has one. I was proud to realize that I, the youngest, the ""baby,"" came out first and paved the way for the older brothers. Of course, they elected to both come out to our parents *one the same day* so its a miracle the two old folks survived. But they had had practice, and eventually handled it well.

I met a man whom I fell in love with beyond anyone I'd ever met. By this time I was living in Florida, where now I reside, near my aging parents whom I knew one day I'd have to care for, as I now do. I brought my boyfriend to my parent's condo for dinner.

All the way up in the elevator I paced. He grinned at me and put his huge arm around my shoulders. ""Aw that's so cute -you're nervous,"" he said. ""Don't stress. I'm sure your parents will like me.""

""Like you? I'm not worries they won't like you. I'm worried you'll meet them and ditch me."" We laughed. I wasn't really kidding. They're quite a comical pair, prone to bickering and unreasonable behavior. Its a bit like Everybody Loves Raymond only funny.

Well, I introduced them to each other and could barely contain my nerves. Mom asked me to help her in the kitchen and I did, but I was terrified to leave him alone with my father. Would they even talk? Would dad be uncomfortable? Would he fart in front of my boyfriend?!

Mom told me how handsome she thought my now ex was. She nattered on about how muscular he was and how nice he seemed and that I'd done well. I really couldn't believe my ears. Two decades of Oprah had really changed her.

But nothing -and I mean nothing, could have prepared me for what awaited me back in the living room. 

I walked back in to find my father... MY FATHER... with his arm around my boyfriend's shoulders, knocking back martinis with him, *laughing* and swapping navy stories (my ex was also ex navy). I think I just stood there for a solid minute staring. The next day, dad told me over the phone, ""he's one great guy. I really like him."" Who could have ever guessed we'd have that conversation.

Today, my mother has suffered from a serious brain tumor and, after two major brain surgeries, isn't doing very well. My father, who worked in a concrete yard his entire life, has had lung cancer from years of exposure to cement dust and other particulates. He lost one lung 2 years ago and last week we were told he has spots on his one remaining lung. Frankly, I don't know how long I will have either of them. But I am very, very proud of my parents and all they have dealt with from 3 gay sons and Im trying to enjoy the time I have left with them. All lives end, and most children must bury their parents. I'm proud to have had the ones I did and to be able to help care for them at the end of their lives. I still can't help but feel these two who have been on their honeymoon for 60 years will, when the time comes, somehow go as they always have -together.

You might have similar experiences to mine. Maybe you once thought you were the only one in the world who was gay. Maybe you went to a religious school. Or maybe you have gay sibling. Then again, your experience might be totally differen than mine. Maybe you will come out on Facebook, no matter how much someone my age blanches at the notion. Maybe your parents are far right conservative christians and its not safe to come out. No one's situation is ever the same, and every relationship comes with its own set of unique complexities an variables. 

I can't tell you how and when you should come out and I can't tell you if your family will be supportive or abandon you. But there are a few things I *can* tell you, from an older gay man to the next generation.

First, you can be you. You didn't choose this and you have nothing to be ashamed of. Its as natural as breathing. Not everyone will accept you. Maybe you'll lose a few friends like I did. Maybe even a parent. But that's not your failing; that's theirs. If it helps in the coming out discussion you might have with them some day, say what I said. Nothing has changed. You were gay before you told them. They just didn't *know* you were gay. If they loved you yesterday, they can love you today because *you are the same person today that you were yesterday -they just know something different about you now.*

Second, your life will unfold in ways you cannot imagine right now. Time is a funny thing. Over time, my mom went from, ""its a phase,"" to, ""he's so handsome!"" Yours may too. Don't burn any bridges and don't reflect back to someone the hate they may show you. Tomorrow they might come to accept you.

But most of all, I want to tell those of you who might be frightened right now or ashamed or depressed because you're struggling with your sexual identity at a young age that, despite it sounding cliche today, *it does get better.* Its easy to feel that it won't, especially when you're young. But take heart. You have a lot to live for and look forward to and things will change. Don't let it keep you down. Set aside those feelings and move forward with your life. Its a great big adventure full of wonderful things, terrible things, boring days, and thrilling moments that will crystallize in your memory forever. Don't give that all up over coming out. Tomorrow just might surprise you.

Me and my parents were visiting with another family, and I think we were having a picnic. My parents have a small group of friends, but I can't seem to recall who we were with. It wasn't a family I knew well or saw very often.

The other family included a boy who was younger than me by 2 to 4 years. At one point, he said to me, ""Come with me, I want to tell you something."" We went somewhere away from our parents, and he said something like ""I think I love you."" I was initially shocked and a bit embarrassed, and I didn't know how to deal with it. My reply was something like, ""Trust me, you don't."" We kept talking for a bit, but I don't remember any of the substance of it. My recollection is that he was completely serious about it; he wasn't trying to trick me or something like that. I didn't really believe him, because he didn't really know me, and even I didn't know what it would mean back then when a male friend said he loved me.

I just remembered this story last night, and I wish I could remember who that was.

She knew what I was trying to tell her but she made me actually say and like walked me through it telling me once its out its easier and just to go right out and tell her. It was so amazing saying it out loud to another person. We talked for a good hour or so and then she had to go home.

After I talked to her I texted my best friend and said I needed to talk to her and it had to be in person, I didnt get a response so I called a couple times until I figured she must be asleep. After an hour or two later I get a call from her but being in front of my dad I had to be discreet and didnt say much. I asked if she was down to grab a cup of coffee at a cafe that is open till 2am (it was about 11:30ish at the time) when she agreed I picked her up. After getting the coffee we talked for a while until she finally asked what was up. It felt like an eternity for me to talk. Every time I was going to open my mouth someone walked by and I was afraid I was going to end up yelling it out. Finally I took a deep breath and said, ""I have a feeling you already know but I have come to accept the fact that....I..I am ... gay."" I was so scared to her reaction I almost closed my eyes but she just hugged me and said FINALLY I was so happy.

After I got it out she let me direct the conversation not really asking too much and just letting me say how much I needed/wanted to say. It was so liberating to get this off my chest. We ended up going to her house to watch some previews of upcoming shows we like to watch that start in the fall (Vampire Diaries and Arrow) and a couple times she asked about my interest in the guys and it was awkward at first because I have NEVER openly expressed interest towards another guy in my life but it was so nice to finally be able to be myself with someone. I asked her not to tell anyone until I gave her the okay and she understood. I asked her if anyone has ever asked if I was gay and she said both her sister and mom have so it seems like it might be easier to come out to them other than my oblivious parents. Driving home I truly realized how much happier I already was. I just couldn't believe I am finally starting to take these steps.

So last year in November I came out of the closet to a friend I met over the internet (Who, is probably the nicest, most accepting person I have ever met). On the 1st of August 2013, I met him, in real life for the first time. At first it was a little awkward (We're both 15 if you're wondering), but as soon as we had gotten over that we started having so much fun. I don't think I've ever had this much fun, even though he's not gay he accepts me for who I am and has been supporting me 100% through any problems that I have had. Unfortunately he had to leave a day before I had, but he said goodbye in a way I will never forget. He went in for a hug, (what I had hoped for :) ), and I thought it was just going to be one of those quick ""I'll see you later"" hugs, but he held on, then looked me in the eyes and said, ""Call me when you get home okay?"", I nodded as he left, and then burst into tears. When I first met him this was not what I had expected to happen, but as we got closer, we ended up agreeing on meeting :)
Thanks for reading if you did, it means a lot to me :)

She has for quite a long time and she still does. This started up around mid-October of 2012. And despite her asking me if ""we"" chance and me telling her ""No"" and things like ""I'm not interested,"" she still continues to hold onto some small shred of hope (probably because her friends say things like ""Oh just give it time, he'll give you a chance.""). This has been ongoing since then, albeit I don't really talk to her anymore.

Enter now, a cute, shy, quiet, young, gay freshman who I began talking to on **January 28**. He was given my number by one of my peers who thought I'd be uncomfortable about talking with a gay guy (Note: Everybody at my school thinks I'm straight). But as time passed I began talking more and more with this freshman, offering him advice, making jokes, getting closer to him; he actually asked me to be his valentine for fun since both of us had nobody.

And it was this past Sunday that he revealed he likes me and he asked me to give him a chance. In my heart I said yes, but I still had to think about how I'd go about this as I know that I'd lose friends and shock many people in my school. So I told him to wait for a bit. I also pointed out to him how I found it extremely hilarious that I give him more thought than I did to the girl who liked me for a longer time and who I just said flat out ""no"" to. She has been trying to get my attention by supposedly becoming my ""type"", but apparently her definition of ""my type"" is an exact female copy of me. She's adopted virtually all of my personal aspects. This has only driven me further away from her as she's clearly being irrational and just plain dumb. She's doing so much and yet I still maintain my ""No."" to her, whereas the freshman just asked one question and I said ""Yes""...not directly to him...not yet at least.

Thursday rolled around (I was busy Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday) and it was after school. I told him before hand that I'd talk to him that day and so I pulled him away from his friends and began to take a walk with him. We went to a quiet, secluded, grassy area and sat by a tree near an elementary school. There I revealed to him that I'm not straight, I'm bi (but more leaning towards gay), and that I agree to out with him. The smile that grew on his face lit up my heart. Good god, if only that one girl knew about this, I bet her self-esteem would plummet and hit the ground just by the mere fact that I chose a guy over her (And dammit I made the right choice!). And so then time flies by and we cover so many topics, from the Walking Dead to religion. But then it started getting late. Just as we get up to head back our school, we embrace. We stand there, swaying side to side for minutes, feeling the other tremble slightly from nervousness and anxiety but at the same time, feeling a sense of warmth, love, and serenity. And when we stop, I turn his head toward mine, and we kiss.

All of this exactly 1 month after we began talking: **February 28, 2013**.

I turned to hookup apps and craigslist and eventually succeeded. I found it awkward, embarrassing and sketchy. Neither of us really knew what we were doing.

Nevertheless, two weeks later I decided to try again. This time the man I met was experienced, knowledgable, kind and willing to teach. I spent three hours with him. In that time I learned more about myself than I have in the previous three years. I was at ease with him in a way I couldn't have imagined before the experience. In those few hours my sexual self-image built up over years of closeted repression and fear seems shattered.

My point is this: I feel incredible about myself and I don't know how long it would have taken me to get out there and try this if this sub and the ones like it hadn't been around.

As my best friend is a very butch lesbian and Washington State legalized gay marriage a while ago, I called her up ranting one day with a crazy idea, an open “gay” marriage. 

After a series of in depth conversations about what it would mean to us and to others, we decided to go through with it. We are trying to make a few points about how we feel about each other, and that whole stupid “sanctity of marriage” argument. A complete explanation of what we are doing and what points we are trying to make can be found [here](http://whitmansmind.com/2013/05/the-wedding) (my point of view) and [here](http://leahmansfield.com/why-im-getting-married/) (the wife's point of view).

The whole thing has started to get a good deal of attention, and very fond responses from just about anyone in my life who has had to at any time grapple with their sexuality or been ostracized for it. 

So anyway, what started as a gag has grown into a ruckus marriage ceremony/party this evening in Seattle which we are hoping to live stream, and have hired a couple of friends to live tweet for us. To get in on that you can follow [#Whitsfield](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23Whitsfield&amp;amp;src=hash) and our twitter staff, @bretthamil &amp;amp; @Scott_Losse. 

We also intend use the same hash-tag for Instagram. 
 
The party will start at 9 PM sharp. Once we get the stream up I will update this post with a link. 

Oh, and we even have a friend ironically protesting the marriage. ",,False,self,t5_2qhef,1369277751.0,,,True,t3_1evcho,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1evcho/i_am_a_straight_man_marrying_a_homosexual_tonight/,

1362543004.0,38,self.gay,19r7iq,So I Met My Ex's Ex...,exsexsex,42,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/19r7iq/so_i_met_my_exs_ex/,"&gt;I often visit /r/gay to read everyone else’s funny/heartwarming/hope-giving stories, but have never posted before. Now that I have found myself in the most interesting of situations, however, &amp; decided I needed to share.

I’m in my early 20s and just got out of a 4-month relationship a few weeks ago. The relationship – while fun at first – had really begun to suck my soul in the last month. Basically, the guy said he had simply fallen out of love overnight while away with his family (he had warned me months ago that that same scenario had happened in the past). 

Throughout the time I knew him, my ex had brought up his ex numerous times. Despite the fact that his ex was brought up at least once a week, he assured me he was completely over his ex – a guy he regularly referred to as a “pot-smoking child”. Anyway, my ex was neurotic/delusional &amp; I was/am extremely glad to be single &amp; free &amp; rediscovering my true self – unhindered by a 1-sided relationship with a self-absorbed asshole.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I – like every other single gay guy – am back on grindr, chatting it up &amp; making some really cool online friends. I had been walking around the park alone one afternoon before I was supposed to meet up with a couple of my online friends at a club. All of a sudden, I get a message from a guy asking if I used to date [my ex’s name]. Suspecting that this may be my ex’s ex, I said yes and asked how he knew me. He verified that he had, in fact, dated my ex, and that he had noticed that pictures of my ex and me had disappeared from my ex’s social networking profile. I playfully responded, “are you the pot-smoking child?” which sparked an interesting chain of events.

We messaged back and forth for about an hour until we finally exchanged phone numbers and continued the conversation via text. He told me his shift ended in soon and invited me over for dinner to chat. After consulting a trusted friend, I canceled my plans and agreed to meet him.

Long story short, I arrived at his apartment, he made us dinner &amp; drinks, and we gossiped about our mutual ex &amp; got to know each other over the next few hours. Come to find out, he is a very mature &amp; cool individual [who turns out not to be a pothead] and seems to be one of the sweetest, most genuine guys I have ever met. We have already made plans to meet again very soon!

How common is it for someone’s exes to meet only to realize that they get along swimmingly &amp; have a lot in common [besides hating the mutual ex ;) ]?

It went FANTASTIC, the first thing he said was 'you couldn't tell me to sit down first?' He was completely fine with it. He had the same worries about my uncles as my mom and I did. I told him that with all the family drama already going on that it was going to be accept that I am gay or GTFO of my life. My dad was great he told me that he was proud and that he would rather see me go through this than tearing myself apart trying to hide it. He also told me it hurt him that i was scared to tell him. Next person on my 'hitlist' is my brother but i can't get a read on him about this. All I know is that I am waiting until after Thursday when my nephew is born in case things go bad. I need to see and hold my nephew once in case that privilege is taken from me, and the sad thing is that is a possibility. But ya.... I am deffinatly feeling great, like im on another planet or something it feels like a dream. I never knew that this could make me so happy and only like 6 people know. I just got home from the movies with my best friend (we saw magic mike ;P) and after the movie we were talking and like joking about stuff like about me being gay and it was a so surreal I never pictured me being able to do it. We talked about guys and everything. So far this is a dream come true. Unfortunately I know it will not be this easy for the whole ride. My parents were easy compared to my uncles. They will find out eventually and I just have to maintain my accept or gtfo mindset. I can't to be comepletly out and start college next month. phew just so happy right now and its been awhile since I have been happy and not have to watch my actions and avoid any 'gay' behavior.

He actually used the word, ""date?"" You're new to all this, fresh out of the closet or just young enough that its your first date? Here's my top ten tips for the perfect date!

1) Appearance. Dress well, manscape, and wear a hint of cologne (not the entire bottle). Everyone wants to date a guy that looks like he takes care of himself and just a bit of cologne says, ""I actually cared about you liking me."" Wear what works for your type but wear something nice; not your usual knock-around clothes. People notice footwear too. Even if you're a surfer bro, a good looking pair of nice flip flops beats those raggedy sneakers smelly enough to wander off of their own accord. But a nice shirt, pair of shoes, pants that aren't just holey blue jeans goes a long way. You want him to think, ""wow, he looks great,"" not, ""hey, I can smell his shirt from here."" Conversely, wearing a $2000 armani ensemble might be offputting and gauche. You just want him to like you, not envy you. 

2) Behavior. First, be on time. ""Fashionably late"" is great for a grand entrance at that $1000 a plate donor buffet you *aren't* going to -not how you should arrive to your first date. No one wants to wait around wondering if you're going to stand them up. Its usually a good indicator that if someone is late to the first date, you can expect a lifetime of it from the relationship. No sense in sending up red flags on day one. Secondly, turn off your fucking phone. If you text during dinner may the gods set your fingers ablaze during the appetizer course! Thirdly, be a gentleman. You have no idea how hot this is to a lot of guys. When you see a hot guy, you want to do him. When you respect him, you want to marry him. Be the guy you'd look up to.

3) Eat and drink conservatively. No beans and you know why. Dont get stuffed so that going out afterwards sounds dreary. Eat light and fresh, nothing heavy, so you have energy. Dont eat things that trash your breath as he'll prolly wanna make out eventually. have a drink if you're so disposed, maybe 2. But no one wants to date a lush so don't get smashed. You want him to compliment you on your hair -not hold it for you over the toilet.

4) Ask about him. One thing that turns me off on a date is when the conversation becomes a monologue from him about himself, never even bothering to ask me anything about myself. Some guys feel like they have to give you a stirring resume to convince you to like them. Dont be that guy. Ask about him and talk about yourself when he asks. Otherwise, just keep it brief and talk about shared interests.

5) Be the man. If you're going on a dinner date, pay for the damned meal. If he offers to pay, accept it graciously. But if he suggests you go dutch, just say, ""Ive got it. You can buy next time."" This is not only polite and a treat for him, it suggests you want a next time. Don't be that guy who stuffs his hands in his pockets when the bill comes and waits expectantly for a freebie.

6) Don't go home next. Suggest another activity after dinner, if you seem to hit it off. Dont just abscond back to one of your apartments for sexy time. Go to a movie only if nothing better presents itself. Avoid dancing if possible as there will always be competition circling you like sharks. No one is more attractive to outsiders than someone they can steal from a date. Try an amusement park, a fair, a museum, anything where you can go and have fun but still talk. Movies are silence in the dark and should only be a last resort.

7) No sex on the first date. No one wants to buy the cow when they get the milk for free. Cuddle. Kiss. Make out hardcore. But stop before the pants unbutton. Explain that you'd like to see him again and that you'd rather not spoil the first date. Most guys can handle that, and will look for you for that next date. You don't have to be a monk, but just not the first night. If you choose to on the second date, that's fine but not the first or, as it tends to happen, there won't be a second. remember, you chose to go on an actual date. If you wanted a hookup instead that's what you should have been doing. What, brave comment-writer, you sexed up your man on the first date and now you're married with 17 adopted children and a dog? Awesome! Its not the norm, though, so I won't suggest it. Its not quite playing hard to get, but if you're really into a guy after an awesome date and he wants to wait for sex, it usually makes you want him more -and respect him too.

8) Be a couple. Yes, its your first date, but a date is like an audition for a buddy movie. You're each trying to see if you make a good couple. No, I don't mean bring a suitcase and move in, arranging photos of your mom and dad on his mantle. I mean you can either mesh like the dynamic duo or be a pair of awkward mooks that just bump into each other. DO NOT talk about ""how hot that guy is."" Even if he's not in the room but just some movie star you like. You will instantly friendzone yourself. Keep it romantic and about each other. Compliment him a few times (do not be a slathering lap dog, just tell him he's cute for god's sake). The less you friendzone yourself the better.

9) Breathe. Fidgety dates can be cute, but most men prefer someone relxed. Dont be self conscious. Just be guys. Talk about the common interests you have and discover new ones. Avoid too much politics. Generally, have a good time.

10) BE CONFIDENT. Nothing is so sexy as confidence. We all want a confident man to smile at us and pull us out of our shell. Take the initiative and be that man. Dont worry about what to do with your hands, quit touching your hair, stop straightening your shirt. Smile, move with purpose, draw him from his shell, and say what you mean. Its priceless.

So, what do you do if *he* breaks some of these rules? Well, if he shows up a bit late or isn't dressed to impress, its not big deal. Go on the date with an open mind and see what happens. But if he shows up late, texts throughout the meal, dresses like a bum, tells you he's lost his wallet when the bill arrives and gets trashed -don't bother with a second date.

But if he's hot, totally do him before you dump him. ;)",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,GaFlair,True,t3_18zy34,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/18zy34/ademnus_top_ten_tips_for_the_perfect_date_yes_i/,

Help me, please.",blooperREAL,45,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/taj7d/im_freaking_out_reddit_like_total_incapacitation/,"I'm freaking out Reddit :'/ 

Like total incapacitation, nausea, want to puke, my brain is about to explode it hurts so much. I can't describe the feeling, but it is similar to gender dysphoria descriptions. I backed myself into a hole and feel like a trapped injured animal. I just want to crawl into some hole and cry until my eyes fall out. I need a hug. 

The Long Background (obviously shortened): 
I left my family when I was very young because I was gay and in total hiding from an extremely early age, consistent memories persist from at least 1st grade  (5/6 yrs for those not in the states) I remember playing around with other guys numerous times and messing with situations so I could get more play in (always my age). My family is ultra religious and the community is not kind , in the least, to those who are gay. Growing up there were countless episodes of someone being discovered and things got messy real fast, some committed suicide, and other left after the whole community got embroiled in things. So. Many. Stories. Disgusting.  I learned to cover up real fast, really young. You just know you are different and even if I didn't exactly know what gay was or that I was gay I knew damn well that I was different in that environment, in a bad way. No tv or general pop culture so there wasn't any situations I could extrapolate or compare mine to. I grew up in shaking fear, and never came out, even after skirting to the edge of the community I was scared to do much unless I felt very very safe and distanced from anything possibly getting back (not paranoia, but there really were people all over including in the gay areas that would out you in a second). But, damn did I have fun when I felt safe, lol. As I got older (low 20s) I kinda danced into the periphery of my family because I realized that some of my siblings were straying from the super religious aspects and getting just normal religious (is there anything really like this anyway?) and I felt it my duty to get a little closer to them so they can learn about me as their sibling (my family is very large, I'm keeping the numbers not exact for my own safety, but well over 10 immediate siblings and I'm the oldest boy with a few older than me. I was missing on all sorts of life events, and also had no community of my own yet. Either way I found a girl that was on the edge of the community to and to make a long story super short I got married to her to be around my family. She is an Ace (although she really doesn't know it) and has all sorts of masculine traits so it kinda works. She has no idea I am gay. I know I set myself up for disaster, but I was so desperate to be with my family at that time that I would do anything. I took it week by week and the years crawled by. We don't fight. Like never. It's really weird, but refreshing. She enjoys my romantic company and feeds off the platonic levels of our relationship. I enjoy my family to some extent and tolerate some aspects of the religions stuff I forced myself into. First year, sex happened only like 4 times after the wedding and she wasn't into it at all so I tolerated it (lots of interesting stories here, some awfully amusing since she really has no ideas about the concept of asexuality so she liked to make all sorts of excuses which cracked me up, and even with promoting she has no initiative to enjoy aspects of sex or take to exploring while in bed, aside from cuddling. She does want kids, I think it's more of her yearning for kids because her more religious friends are all popping out kids, but doesn't really associate 'no sex:no kids'. Before her, I had sexual urges to fuck at least 4 times a week, and more if I had a fuck buddy around or was with anyone steady or cruising for guys. 

Regardless, of her. I have suppressed my urges for so long that I am genuinely freaking out now. It's not only that she but the brakes on sex. It has gotten worse lately because I found a friend who has been helping me cope. He helped me get a grip on what I did to myself, and is there to help me navigate my emotions. And I am starting to see the freedom I have not given myself with my choices. He had a very hard life too, and many of our things resonate. I was there for him while he needed someone to lean on. He's a trans man and will be finally starting his testosterone soon. I am so excited for him. I am not looking to settle with him (i.e. that is not what is prompting me to get all ansty and dysphoric). I love him like a real brother not a sexual partner. He knows everything about me (although refuses to be around my wife for obvious reasons or my home because he knows the angst it causes me and my wife knows his name), and he has been a great listener while not always understanding my choices but knows just what to do when I tend to get close to snapping. I love kids, but really don't want to have kids with her. I want to be free. 

I want to be gay. I want to be openly gay. I want to love being gay. I want to not even think about the fact that I am gay. I just want to be me. I want to stop suppressing all my mannerism, voice, inflections, love for art, love for music, love for life, love for genderqueer people and hot yummy gay men, I want to cook with gusto, and go to the pride parade, I want to watch tv shows and comment how sexy someone is, or approach a hot guy to chat when I see him at the gym or on the street, I want to wear fashionable clothes, and keep an impeccable home, I want to learn more show-tunes and belt them out when I feel like the world has a happy rainbow over my head, I want to suck a cock while moaning with it deep and finally play around enough to know if I am versatile or an exclusive top or bottom, I want to have my old family love me for who I am and make a new one of my own choosing, I want to fight social injustices that I see every day, and not feel like I am living in Nazi Germany or have to drink from a different water fountain, I want to stop worrying about petty garbage and start living my life, I want to breath happily every morning when I wake up, and stop monitoring my every statement, I want to kiss a guy passionately, and cruise the art galleries for interesting symbolism, I want to socialize with gay culture, and stop seeking daddy figures who only want my hole, I want to cry when I feel like it, and stop being so macho for nothing, I want to wear clothes with a hot pop of color, and stop being around those praying to a deity that hates who I am and wants me to die horribly and burn in hell for eternity, I want to live. I want to shout my love for a sexy man and then show him with my actions on an emotional level and sexual level. I want to enjoy a salty breeze while walking with their fingers entwined in my hand while felling their gentle touch and resonating on a deeper level. I want to caress an angular face, and jog together. I want to lose my breath again while having sex, and be brought back to a level of bliss that I miss so much. I want to reignite my joy for life, and stop worrying about ridiculous dietary restrictions. I want to tease my guy all week and then spend all weekend in bed. I want a picture of him in my wallet and a computer background of us. I would log back into facebook just to upload a picture of us (then never go back into it, bc I hate what it stands for). I want to explore sexual threesomes with him and grow old together. I want to dress in a tux and clink my glass against his while we raise money at philanthropic parties while bringing awareness to people in insular communities like me. I want to change the world, and cuddle in bed at night knowing I made a difference that day. I just want to live. I just want to be me. I want to never think about the fact that I am gay. I want to continue to love being gay. I love being gay. 

Sniff...End cry. Thank you Reddit for your shoulder. I will now drop my head and go back to my miserable life which I created for myself.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_taj7d,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/taj7d/im_freaking_out_reddit_like_total_incapacitation/,

But....there's more. He also admitted today that he is in love with me. Okay, I can deal with that. He is my best friend and I love him too. I just took that as I had to be very careful as to not lead him on in any way and to make sure not to treat him any differently.

But...there's more. He told me that he was so in love with me that if I was unable to return this affection that he did not think that we could be friends or see each other anymore. I was flabbergasted. I assured him that we could still be friends and that nothing would change, but he insists that he cannot do it.

But....there's more. I am actually considering it. He is the best friend that I have ever had. And yes, I do love him. I cannot imagine losing him at this point in my life.

1356060261.0,35,self.gay,157g5k,I came out to my friends tonight. ,,42,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/157g5k/i_came_out_to_my_friends_tonight/,"Hey gays everywhere sorry for the wall of text, but its a positive story, please read and comment, I would love to hear responses; Solidarity and all that. 

Now this is the story all about how 
My life didn't get, turned upside down,
And I'd like to take a minute just sit right there 
I'll tell you how I became the queen of a town called (wouldnt you like to know)

So there is a serious message after the Fresh Prince lyrics. I came out to my closest friends; about 10 guys. We are all part of a group that is tightly knit, a combination of an acting troup from our last years at school, and a walking group that have walked over the UK up mountains and so forth. They are pretty misogynistic, and talk about conquests all the time, but in a light hearted way, so i posted on the fb thread that I had something to tell next time we met. We are all 20-21 and enjoy each others company and banter (especially the banter), especially after we are drinking. So tonight, when they steered the conversation through a drinking game at mine about my recent sexual exploits, I mentioned that I am gay, nervously I might add. But the response was almost ambivalent. They didnt mind, they found that me telling them first was very commendable, and they respected me more for it. 

Later, when I made a joke about me being the most qualified in the gay department, one of the group said 'i wanted to talk to you about it', we had a very frank discussion, he wanted to know how I knew, why I had decided, and when the group came together again out of a club and the certain moment had arisen, I said that I was so thankful for having such good friends that hadn't batted an eyelid to my remark. Many were inquisitive, and wanted to know why I had come out, a few had known a few years before; when I told two of them, before I was comfortable with my sexuality. They were overwhelmingly supportive, wanted to know my sexual exploits (not in graphic detail mind), and how I felt. I cannot really explain the feeling inside right now, except the warm feeling of intoxication... But in all seriousness, my friends have made me feel so, so, so comfortable with whom I am, that I know in the new year I will tell my parents that I am gay. I really could not have asked for a better group of lads. The best thing is nothing has changed, except that they have become more interested in my motivation and exploits. Its not only thrilling, but so satisfying that I know I will have a group of guys who love me for whom I am, and don't care whom I stick my cock into. 

I would like to say, that I am one of the most straight acting people you may come across, many were not expecting an outburst that had been said, so they could not have second guessed me. Also when I told them I was sober, so this is not down to alcohol consumption, for you doubters out there. I am incredibly lucky to have such a group of friends who are so happy with my orientation. When I told them, I felt so empowered, 1000 times more happy than I had before. I cant stop smiling, I am so happy. I have known for a while that I was gay, but have been dealing with it mostly privately for many years, to tell my closest friends and for them to accept and endorse it, is.. words cannot describe. 

I know now that I am going to tell my parents in the New Year. They are deeply Catholic, but I feel that though they might not be happy, they will accept and support me. I also plan to film the whole episode to show that even those deeply religious and conservative (small c) are willing to accept their loved ones genetic make up. With the film, whether it be a good response or bad, (it will be good), it will go on youtube to show the world how good it gets, and for people whom are struggling with these issues to empower themselves. 

I am sorry for this wall of text, I hope it has been entertaining at times, supportive for those who need it, and reiterates previous posts about how glad people feel after their sexual emancipation. I know its quite old to come out (20) but I felt it was the right time. There are a whole bunch of issues surrounding my family, least of all about inheritance, since I am the first born of the generation and male. I will keep you posted on my coming out to my mum with a link to youtube in the future, for those interested. Many thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read my story. X

See i have never actually been attracted to a man EVER. Ive never once seen a man and say boy i would like to fuck him. I am attracted to women and love having sex with women,i want to be with a women at the end of everything i guess, but like i said before they don't full fill 'all' my sexual desires.

So is called anything? Does being by bisexual mean u have to be attracted to the same sex? I just wanted to expand my sexual pleasures by moving on to men but i have no desire to be with one, i have never gone erect in a shower full of naked men, i dont like anal at all but i love sucking dick and fucking men.

You redditors are the first ones that I'm coming out to. I'm 15 years old, gay, and hate it. I hate the fact that people have to sign laws and use special treatment to get equal rights for gays or whatever, I hate how casual the word ""gay"" is used around me as I just sit there thinking, ""hey, I'm gay and that's kinda rude."" I hate that one day, I can't have a family with my wife and KIDS. My own kids, not someone I've adopted or obtained some other way. The fact that the only way my family is going to continue is through my brother who doesn't go to college or have a job. Please Reddit, how do I cope? I'm also not open to coming out anytime soon, no matter how painless you say it'll be in the long term, or how ""it'll get better."" 

Next point. 

To convince people that I'm not gay, even though I'm pretty sure I show every characteristic, I have a ""girlfriend"" that I've been using as a cover for about a year and five months. She's told me repeatedly how she loves me, and I say it back, (of course lying,) to the point where I'm convinced that I've made her ""love"" me. I've come to the realization that this has to end before anything else, but I see no way to break up with her. I haven't consistently gone on dates with her in a year, and (again) I'm not planning on coming out to anyone real soon. If I can get some tips there, too, I would love you.

 Finally, I want your opinions, and some final questions. How do you cope with being gay...the fact that millions look down on you, that some people in our own government (US) are working to go against us? How do you feel knowing that it's impossible to have your own kid, with your own ""normal"" family? Are you happy with your lives? And finally, why are so many gays addicted to sex, all the time? 

I realize that I sound ranty and closeminded, but please, add anything you feel would help for my eternal love and gratitude.

With the recent death of the co-owner of reddit a lot of his writings seem to have surfaced and I happened to see the one about him talking about how he is not gay, rather just a human who happens to like ""hooking up"" with men and women.  So it kind of set the topic for me.

I feel like this is a common theme in many LGBT circles, or what they would call themselves are queers or something of that flavor.  I have no problem with this (why would I?), however what I have a problem with is this argument between people about not labeling ourselves.

I'm a person who thinks words are important, but in this instance I think the criticism towards the terms gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transexual are misplaced.  The problem is, and I agree, when the label becomes an identity.  In the context of the conversation that is going on the assumption is that these labels are identities, because after all they are merely attributes.  But of course with that said I am still gay categorically.  My identity is me as a whole, including the various attributes and the expression of those.  I am gay, but that is not who I am, rather a distinctive characteristic that I have.

I am bothered by people completely rejecting labels throughout, like as if we were to use a label it makes it somehow ready for a picking.  Well no, categorically we are different.  I am categorically different than a heterosexual male because I don't find vagina attractive.  That does not confine me to say that I can never find pleasure in heterosexual relations.  The label merely communicates from one to another what I find attractive, it is an attribute.

It is no different than saying that I have blue eyes.  We are all humans, but some humans have blue eyes, some hazel, some green, some red (Albino's anyone?).  We don't deny these exist, we just acknowledge the difference.  They are all eyes.

I hear that we need to start calling ourselves ""human"" or something like that: well of course we are all humans.  But with that said we are all humans with different attributes, and attributes are divisible.  We don't create false conformity for comfort, but rather acknowledge and tolerate differences from person to person.

I am just frustrated reading posts proposing being vague.  Words have a purpose and we need to use accurate and detailed words.

Argue back, I have an open mind but I felt like I needed to make the case for labels.

I'm 22 turning 23 in two months, he turned 21 just yesterday. There are loads of questions swirling around in my head, most of which are related to sex, and about the experiences we've had so far. I have had essentially 0 experience before him, so these questions are pretty big.

* We have had anal relatively frequently, but we usually enjoy other forms of intercourse more. When I top him, unfortunately, I end up dirty a bit more than 50% of the time. He has never had this issue before (he's had several sexual partners before me), and I'm not his largest, although I'm up there (just under 8""). He knows his body pretty well, and we wait until at least 2 hours after his last bowel movement before doing anything. Does anyone have tips on how to make it less dirty? It's pretty unappealing, and the size of my urethra gives me concern for UTIs if we end up going bareback (after testing for STDs). Enemas are not out of the question, but we are frugal.

* I have bottomed for him several times as well, and it's... weird. I get no direct pleasure from it - in fact it's pretty uncomfortable. He's on the average size, around 6"", so I don't think it has to do with that, though I do have a small-ish frame, being 5' 10"" and weighing 140lb. Receiving is the weirdest disconnect for me, because even though I experience no conscious pleasure, I do remain hard and usually ejaculate pretty fiercely after the whole ordeal, telling me that my penis enjoyed it more than I did. Is this normal? Is there any way to perhaps make this experience more enjoyable for me?
* We frequently do oral, and essentially always swallow. However, timing of orgasms is always annoying, as I enjoy performing oral less right after I've ejaculated; and he enjoys it less (and his gag reflex acts up too) after he's just ejaculated. We've started taking turns on this and dealing with it in other ways. How do you deal with the post-orgasm lack of desire to continue sexy times?
* What are some ways you've found to overcome your gag reflex?
* Are you able to get off on hands-free oral?

On a more direct note, both of us are still virgins (hes pretty much the shyest guy ever, he had a lot of trouble telling me, even after I came out to him) and I can honestly say I've never done this before and never thought about the specific mechanics behind doing it.

He invited me over to his house for a ""sleepover"" kind of thing, and if hes insinuating what I think he is, more is going down than a movie and some popcorn.

I don't know if I would prefer to be top or bottom, as I've never tried either.

Should I buy and bring condoms even if this is both our first time? I've heard they recieve all of the friction and your left with a small portion of it.

If I were to bottom, is there any kind of preparation I need to do beforehand to make things as clean as possible?


How pleasurable is it really to receive anal? I've heard of people reaching orgasm on this alone but that seems far fetched to me.

We've really enjoyed spending time with each other, the sex is great, I feel super comfortable around him, we share a lot of interests and passions, etc. All-in-all, its probably the best situation I've found myself in for a long time (I've been single for the past 2.5 years).

Anyways, we hung out at my place with my roommate and a couple of our friends, had a grand old time. Afterwards, we were cuddled up in bed and he just kind of whispered ""I love you"" as we were falling asleep. There's definitely no mistaking it, he definitely said it a couple times.

I didn't really know how to respond. For me, its definitely too early for that particular verbiage. I've been very guarded since my last relationship, and while I'm definitely open to anything with this guy, because I really like him a lot and could definitely see this going somewhere, I'm not comfortable saying it back at this point and don't even know how to react to him saying it. That's not to say I definitely haven't thought about it, because being with him feels wonderful in so many ways. Heck, I've even had an extended marriage fantasy before falling asleep earlier this week, but it just seems like 2 or 3 weeks, even of hanging out almost every night, can't possibly be enough time to develop real feelings.

So, any thoughts people have would be nice... Or tell me, when is it that you feel its appropriate to say I love you for the first time in a relationship?",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_19zici,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/19zici/guy_im_dating_dropped_the_lbomb/,

he really said the last part. it made me smile like an idiot. we talked after that and i asked if we're officially, like, together, and he was like, you're stupid and i love you too. cheesy bullshit i know. anyway yeah we're getting there! turns out i like kissing him. a lot.

We ""met"" on scruff and it grew from messaging there to texting. We would trade pics fairly often, mainly at his insistence, and they seemed pretty consistent looking. 

  We talked about meeting but but always had scheduling conflicts as he worked mainly overnight and I worked early in the mornings (he would be awake, while I would be asleep for the next day). 

The day before yesterday, I kinda ditched a opportunity where he would be at work and I could see him. Feeling bad about it, I decided to surprise him and go yesterday, texting him to be sure he was there. 

I get to his job and ask the girl in front if he was around. She told me he was busy. Not wanting to waste a trip out there (about a 20 minute drive), I told her that I would wait for him. Time goes by and the women keeps looking at me while wonder over and get a ice cream. Then she tells me that he is waiting for me by the other register. So I go over there and....he was similar to but not quite the person who kept sending me selfies. I mean, I guess conceivably it COULD have been him when he was younger ( he is supposedly 22) and a lot more heavy set than I was led to believe ( we would talk about going to the gym and work outs). 

After watching him get chewed out by his boss, he finally turned to me and in a hushed tone he asked me what was up. I said not much just was in the neighborhood ( I was trying to be cute I guess idk) and he apologized but he didn't have time for chit chat. I apologized and explained that I felt bad about the other day. And that was it. 

I don't know what I hope to accomplish with this. I guess thanks for reading if you made I this far.  I kinda feel betrayed by all this, and scared because of the type of photos he has of me (nothing too explicit, but i really don't want them to come out, dumb of me I know). But worst of all, some guy I thought I knew turned out to be someone I can't really trust. 

TL;DR : boy I've been talking to may have misrepresented himself, surprised him at work, doesn't look like he was pictured. 

**UPDATE**

Texted him the day after i met him day after and after all day of not hearing from him texted him again. He texted me that night (I was asleep, yay for double shifts) saying something along the lines of ""sorry, not interested"". After having a laugh to myself, I texted back ""lol, that's laughable coming from the guy that sent me false pics of himself"". Deleted his number and forgot about it. He texted me back later that day (can't reach my phone while at work), ""get over yourself dude (da fuck??), I'm not interested. I need a real man"". Was going to text something back, but I figured I would end there, I said what I needed to and haven't thought about him since.

I just want to get this off my chest and maybe some advice from those who can maybe relate. I feel terrible. I feel like I disappointed my friends and made them feel bad for something out of their control. 

I've been out of the closet for barely a year, never been in a relationship, never let people who were in relationships bother me. Tonight, I guess whatever it was that kept me smiling just failed on me. 

We were having our Cinco de Mayo dinner at a friends' place. Everything was great, we made and ate tacos and had some Corona's, no problem. Just me, a good friend, and the couple who owns the place who are also good friends of mine. Then good friend #1's girlfriend came over and we all talked and drank. I just kept telling myself ""Whatever, I'm with my best friends. I'm just enjoying the night"" Then another couple, of whom I am good friends with, came over and I just couldn't do it anymore.

I couldn't stay in a room full of my best friends who all happened to be  coupled up. I was a 7th wheel and everyone knew it. At that point, I just had to go. What made it worse is that I walked in on my current roommate with his girlfriend who is spending the night in the room now (total bullshit). 

I've only been out to all of my friends for less than a year now, and they all accept me and I couldn't be happier. I just don't make friends with other gay men, I guess. I don't know why I feel so desperate all of a sudden. I've never been so down before.

I've been reading this subreddit forever it seems, and have a question for you all. 

So, I am 19, and recently (2-3 months ago) came out of the closet. I was stuck in it, and thought that since I joined the military, I'd have to hide that part of myself and continue playing straight. However, with the repeal of DADT and other anti-harassment organizations, I felt that my colleges would be accepting and supportive of my sexuality (unlike my friends from back home), and came out. In my experience so far, it's been great!

I am just arriving at my first duty station in Alabama. I'm pretty open about being gay, but nobody here knows yet- I'm not trying to hide it, I've just been so busy getting checked in, and I don't want to seem like I'm parading myself for attention or anything. My real concern is LGBT support in Alabama- actually, the lack of. 

Does anyone have any ways to find a supportive LGBT community in a state that largely opposes the lifestyle? I'm scared about trying to meet people or find things to do, just because of the small percent of people that will move to violence if they see anything gay (and we've had problems with that in the surrounding area). Most of the people on the base are older, married, and I've only met 1 other gay person (who was 30 years older than me). It's a pretty small base, so I'm pretty confident I make up 50% of the gay population here...

I've checked into local LGBT Pride websites, and have found one semi active group 3-4 hours away from me. Local groups don't meet up anymore. I'm having problems with trying to be myself. I'm young and want to get into the culture and have fun and maybe even a relationship, but here that just seems like a dream. Any thoughts?

I'm from a small-ish town in the heart of red-neck county, Southern Alberta, and I recently started going out with a really cool guy.  The thing about him though is that he is completely out of the closet, and I'm just sort of.  Anyway, what I didn't know was that we have, basically, the same social circle of friends, and me being me, I kind of thought that people would be weirded out if they came to visit and found out I was going out with him.  I'm not overtly gay acting or however you would say that, so a lot of people make the assumption that I'm straight.  Anyway, he had a get-together at his house a few weekends ago, and he invited a few people over that I'm pretty good friends with, hell one of them was going out with my a close cousin of mine, so you can imagine that I was a little freaked out, but I sucked it up.  Of course my BF was really supportive, and told me I didn't have to stick around if I didn't want to, but I decided I would.  Anyway, people show up, we're having drinks, and nobody cared, I mean they were, like, a little taken aback at first, but the night went on like that wasn't even an issue.  I was talking to our friends like we always talked.  they weren't weirded out, just hanging out and having drinks like we always.  Everyone was really supportive of me and him, and that's what weirded me out.

 I'm so used to people acting like complete redneck homophobes in this town.

KIND OF THE WRONG WORD BUT WORTH IT.  It suddenly got intense, and before you know it the above repartee was born!  :D  Don't you think it's strange how sexuality can be so fixated in some people?  Even though I've had my ""straight moments"", I'm still predominantly gay, and label myself as such.  In contrast, I doubt if my lady lovin' friend would ever find a guy that he fancies in this lifetime.  But at the heart of all this is this question: what causes certain physical characteristics in a specific gender to get us sexually aroused over others, or why is sexuality so exclusive so often?  Two straight men can even look at the same woman and one can say ""She's not my type"" while the other is already trying to get her number.  Also, why is bisexuality not nearly as common as psychological allegiance to a certain gender preference?  It's not just physical, either...it's emotional, too.  I can see certain girls as friends to me, but I can't possibly picture them as soulmates.  Life's just weird.

We chatted for a while through email and decided to go to the famous gay district of Tokyo. We wind up in the basement in the picture. It was called ""The boiler room underwear lounge."" and I didn't really know what it was because as you can see it looks like a utility room. So I open the door and go in and it's a dark room full of men in their underwear. They stop and just stare at me because I'm the only non-Asian and I'm way overdressed. Suddenly I realize that this means I have to get into my underwear too and it's too late to back out but all I'm wearing is a thong. Also I just shaved my legs smooth. So I strip in front of them and it's like dangling meat in front of lions. They just can't take their eyes off of me. Even the DJ and both bar tenders stopped. My dom puts his hand on the small of my back and pushes me up the small metal staircase to the loft overlooking the lounge and we sit down on one of the couches up there. They were still staring every step I took up the stairs and immediately 6 Japanese guys come up and just start hovering around. Two of them start touching on the couch next to me and this guy with a mohawk and really toned muscles is giving another guy a blowjob. He was really going to town giving his full effort. Another one sits down next to me and starts touching my leg. My dom takes his hand and puts it on my balls and he starts stroking me through my underwear. Now I had two men, one on either side, teasing me. I tugged on the Japanese guy's shorts and he took them off for me. I was kind of shocked at how small his dick was. I mean I've seen pictures and Japanese porn, but somehow I thought it was just the scale of the picture. His dick was so tiny I couldn't even wrap my fingers around it, I had to use just my index finger and thumb to stroke him, but I liked it. It still had a nice curve and mushroom tip and he responded well. My dom is also Asian and I discovered his was also small but much thicker. The Japanese guy finally reached into my underwear and tried to pull my penis out but he had to use both hands to free it. This got a lot of attention and kind of changed the mood. It was strange. Before I thought they wanted to fuck me and I liked that idea, but somehow they changed when they saw I had the biggest dick in the room. The story isn't as sexy from here because my 'dom' actually got weird and instead of ordering me around he went soft and started talking about how he might like me to fuck him. Nothing of the sort happened because I had already made up my mind that I wasn't going to do anything like that on my first time. Just some touching and kissing. He says he was just being nice because we're still friends and he's not actually my master yet. I really was really hoping that he could dominate me and fulfill my fantasies, and he says he can, but he seems to lose face in the heat of the moment. It's confusing as hell for me too because I actually felt powerful and like I wanted to control him and the other Japanese boys that were there, but at the same time the most exciting part was being desired by them.

They say awful things and things that doesn't even make sense. I'm not ready to come out to my parents yet. They are muslims (I hate religion, sorry) and being gay would make them angry and kick me out. They even hate my brother (But do love him and take care of him so don't worry) because of one he did. He's together with a girl that's not from the same country as him. She's from Spain and from Arabia. He loves her and she loves him and they argue about this everytime my brother comes to visit. He has his own apartment and they live together, they got together when he was 14. I hope you understand what i'm trying to say. That small thing makes them mad and sad and he moved out because he couldn't handle that they had to argue every day about that. What if I told them about me? They would probably kick me out.
I hate this world. I hate homophobes, who are THEY to tell me who i can and can't love? I'm so freaking sorry that you all have to be afraid. I'm so sorry that so much hate destroys our life.

Dear Emma,

OK, this may sound like déjà vu - but if you have literally 90 seconds and care about ending discrimination against same sex couples, right now you can make a big difference in an important Government survey.

Last fortnight the Senate held a public inquiry about ending same-sex discrimination in the Marriage Act. Now the House of Representatives has a similar, and equally important, inquiry.

Click here to take part.

The Senate inquiry received more submissions than any other in history, and over 60% called for change! Now it's a game of numbers in this House of Representatives survey. Over 100,000 have already participated, and while most support ending marriage discrimination, the Australian Christian Lobby and others are asking conservative voices to flood the survey. The official results will be considered in Parliament, so it's obviously important that we speak up for equality.

http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees

Oh, and if you're wondering what question 2 is all about, here's the lowdown.

Basically, if you support same-sex marriage, you probably support both bills. Stephen Jones is a Labor MP, and his bill was introduced to reflect the change in ALP party policy at the end of last year - policy which now supports marriage equality! Mr Bandt is a Greens MP and his bill, which is co-sponsored by Independent MP Andrew Wilkie, has a similar effect but includes additional language to ensure religious ministers will not be obliged to perform same-sex marriages.

Other than that, it's all very simple. If you have the time to simply answer 4 tick-box questions, you have time to join the chorus of Australians calling for equality!

Access Parliament’s survey here.

If we're successful, the Inquiry will recommend the bills to the lower house: another positive step toward reform that will make Australia a more equal and inclusive nation, based on love and, like our campaign, its ability to bring people together.

Yeah, I've had slight tinges of affection for girls, but nothing like this. Right now, I'm crushing on a guy and all I can think about is cuddling and kissing him and just about everything else. I want to spend all of my time with him.

During all of my time questioning, I've been trying to compare how I feel about people physically. But now I realize that that's kind of silly. It should be more about how I feel about them as people, not as sex objects.

I'm in my 20s and I never experienced significant affection for anyone in the past. I had some girlfriends, but I always felt so distant from them, and they always initiated the relationship, but not me. I hated myself for feeling so cold. In a society filled with love songs and Disney movies and all that, I felt oddly removed from the concept of love.

I finally tried to explore myself and how I feel about men. Now I'm practically head over heels for this boy and am nearly chasing him like a love-deprived demon. I never realized I had this in me. Really. You have no idea how happy I am merely discovering that I am *capable* of liking people. Even if nothing comes of this particular crush, I still feel so liberated somehow, because I've found something that I must have hidden from myself for so long.

I've been questioning for so long, wanting to come out, but I've lacked too much confidence in myself to do so.

I just felt as if I should update on what's happened since then.

Well. Around a month in, me and my boyfriend unfortunately broke up. We just felt as if things/feelings between us had died down and it would be best to return to being friends. And this is how it continued for sometime.

Time passed and I was still friends with my Ex- but I noticed my feelings that had died down for him started growing again. This went on for some time until one day he blatantly told me ""I still like you."" I was taken back because I thought he had gotten over me. In actuality, his feelings also increased for me. So I said to him ""do you think it deserves a second chance?"" He said ""Yes."" 

And from there, the news spread like wildfire. We're in a small school in the LA County and so administration found out in two days. One day it's after school while holding my boyfriend from behind while sitting at a lunch table, and the next day I'm in the office being told to stop my public display of affection (My school abhors any PDA, all the students are is just a source of high API scores so that we stay open. Nothing more.)

I didn't give the warning much thought. I continued. Especially one day after school where I went with my boyfriend to go sit by a tree near the parking lot of the school, strangely some chairs were left there and so I sat down and he sat in my lap. And we stayed there talking and holding each other. For about the last 10 minutes before he left, we sat there in silence, just taking in the moment. I buried my face in his neck. Just as we saw his car in the distance and as he was going to get up, I hold him down and we look at each other straight in the eyes and before we know it, our lips are locked.

On the last day of school (Just this past Thursday for me), he wanted me to come to his house. I said bye to everybody and the teachers (Possibly for the last time as I might move schools) and went with him. We had to take the bus in order to get there. It was a hot day and so he said he'd take a shower. I stayed in his room. I practically fucking sunk into his bed like a rock into water so I layed down on the floor rather. Later he comes in with a gray shirt, wet hair, and light gray gym shorts that defined his cute little ass. My heart fluttered. He crawled onto his bed and told me to sit lay down next to him.

I obviously complied. So I got next to him and he cuddles with me as we go on his ipod, watch videos, talk, and mess around. I won't lie, I got hard. And he knew it. When he would put something on his ipod for me to see, he would turn over on his other side, poke out his ass a bit, and say ""Tell me when you're done."" I'd finish whatever it was, then press up against him from behind and spoon with him. He would actually rhythmically move his hips and I'd go with his motion. I knew he got hard from it because he put a pillow in between his legs to cover his junk. 

His parents came home, thank fully they didn't come into the room. I met them and we went back into his room. He layed down saying ""I'm tired."" And in the next moment, I'm on top of him looking down at him. He brings me down so that he can hold/hug me. We stay like that for literally 5 minutes or more, as he moves his hands all around my neck, shoulders, shoulder blades, back, and hips as if he can't believe that I'm there. I say to him ""Yes...yes...I'm here. Dont worry. You don't have to keep feeling to make sure. I'm here....I'll always be here."" He held me even tighter, I don't think he would ever let go had his dad not call him for something

When he let go, we looked at each other straight in the eyes again, and I bring myself down kiss his lower lip. And again...and again...and again. As we lie there, kissing each other, both of us hard, he moves his hands all around my back again and even down to my ass. I move a hand up to the back of his head and use my fingers to grab and mess with his hair. And with just perfect timing as you'd expect in a movie, when we stop, his dad calls him again. He gets up to go and sit there, smiling, and wipe the saliva off my lips.

Unfortunately I had to go (and this is getting sorta long...no pun intended), I live sorta far from him. But no worries. Because this coming Monday I'm coming over again :)",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_1fhv3y,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/1fhv3y/i_find_this_hilarious_update/,

A lot of my friends at the school who I knew before coming here already knew I'm gay and it is known as being just about the friendliest, most accepting school you could ever go to, although I do still have some troubles since I come off as a very masculine, super straight guy, making explaining my sexuality difficult at times.

About two weeks after switching schools, I noticed this guy in one of my classes. Over time, I'd notice that often when I'd look at him, he'd be looking back at me too, and I know this can be accidental but it felt as if something was there. I decided to ask one of his very close friends if he had any dating history, explaining that I was gay and interested in him, and she said that although she was under the impression he was straight, he'd never dated anyone and only spoke very rarely here or there about liking any girls.

I try not to read into stereotypes because I know I myself am I prime example of how they can be very misleading, but I couldn't help but notice ALL of his best friends were girls. There are pictures all over facebook of him hugging girls in very platonic, purposely posed for the camera ways, or hanging out with groups of girls at night at one of their homes, even though according to his good friend he wasn't interested in any of them. I know this isn't necessarily indicative of sexuality, but I couldn't help but take note of the fact that he has a very abnormal level of platonic comfort with an entourage of girls and no guy friends whom are on a similar level.

As the weeks have gone on, the frequent instances of eye contact have increased. At first I got the impression that there was a mutual sense of that ""deer in the headlights"" awkwardness that comes with first starting to like someone, although that could've all been on me. As I've gotten to know him more, there've been other very positive signs. When hanging out in groups, whenever I'd say anything I'd always notice his head turn so that he'd be looking right at me and got the sense that he was intently listening to every word I said. He'd laugh and smile at things I'd say even if they weren't that funny, and a couple of times when one of his friends would talk about him in front of me he'd smile, get very red in the face and look away as if he wasn't listening.

For some reason I felt different about him. In the past with these situations there was always a sense of doubt or risk, but this time I just have this gut feeling that it's right and that it's meant to be, that there's no reason to have doubt, which is a new feeling for me. I was ready to slowly start breaching the topic of me being gay to see how he'd react until about last Friday. We were hanging out afterschool in a group talking about the softball team, when someone said ""isn't that girl x from y school on the team?"", and he turned to one of our mutual friends and quietly, so that only the two of them were supposed to hear, ""isn't she the one who's supposed to be super hot?"". In response, our friend somewhat louder said, ""wait you think she's hot?"", to which he quickly said ""shhhh don't talk so loudly"" and ended the conversation.

Also, I just heard today that my friend who I had talked about him with had told him that an anonymous gay guy at our school liked him, just to see how he'd react. According to her, he seemed very flustered, surprised and caught off guard, and gave a very hesitant answer as if he was somewhat weirded out by the news.

Up until this point, I was fairly confident in my chances, however that's all been shattered now. I really really like this guy a lot, but don't know if I should stick with it or give up prematurely to avoid the risk of ending up more hurt in the long run. My friends who know him have said mixed things, some thinking my chances are very good compared to normal and some thinking he's straight.

HE wants to blow ME. He says he's bi-curious and wants to have sex, so I started talking to him about it and what he wanted to do. Well, turns out he's very submissive. He only wants to be on bottom (which is okay with me because I'm a top) and he wants to know what it's like to give me a blowjob. I asked him if he was sure he didn't want anything in return, but he said doing it would be his treat.

* Tuesday- I ask him if I could borrow a tent and he says ""oh you wanna go camping?"" I tell him he invited me the day before, things feel a little awkward. He tells me I'm more than welcome to come if I want. 
* Wednesday- We go to the bar and I tell him I got the day off and that I picked up food and liquor for friday and he says ""oh you really want to go do you?"" I thought he was joking because that's his sense of humor. A half hour later and he angrily asked me if I told people at the fire house [who are very accepting but they are still quite ignorant as far as the whole gay thing goes] I told him I told my chief. At this point I'm thinking he was serious earlier. He gets blackout drunk and I ask him if I should just pick up my tent because he might forget it [coaxing the convo a little bit] and he says ""you really wanna go"" again so I plainly ask him ""you don't want me to go do you?"" he says ""not really."" At this point I'm angry at him for taking back the invite and I'm assuming Its because he's embarrassed about going camping with me. I'm furious at everyone at the firehouse for endangering yet another friendship. I drop him off shortly thereafter. 
* Thursday- I'm questioning whether or not I want to remain friends with someone that is embarrassed to be my friend. I'm very angry and being short with him when he texts me. That night he calls me and I tell him what happens. He tells me that he was drunk and that it wasn't him. I tell him it was still his mouth that said it and that it pissed me off. I tell him I had to question whether I still wanted to be his friend and he gets angry because I would so readily drop him like that. Camping was never mentioned.

Okay. So I'm 15 years old and a freshman in highschool. I've been pretty sure I was gay for a while. I get off to Gay Porn way more often and a lot easier than straight porn. When I used to try and get off to straight porn, it always felt like I was kind of...forcing it, if you know what I mean. I'd openly admit that I'm way more attracted sexually to guys than girls.

Anyways, recently I've told a few people of my raging homosexuality, and even kind of started ""talking"" and going on dates with this other dude. But, there is this deep down fear inside me that one day it will all change, and I'll be trapped. I know it doesn't make any sense at all. But the fear is there. What if I wake up tomorrow and don't like dudes anymore, but I've already told everyone I'm gay? 

Before I told people I was gay, I used to re-assure myself I was straight literally seconds after getting off to gay porn. Am I just going to have to get used to not be able to lie to myself anymore?

I think it might be a good idea to come up with a guide of how you should treat other human beings when chatting with them on grindr. Here are my ideas, please feel free to give them a ""yea"" or ""nay,"" and add some of your own! 

1. Be polite. Remember that there is a human on the other side of that picture. If you wouldn't say it in real life, don't say it on grindr.

2. Be accurate with photographs. If you have a smartphone that can handle grindr, then you have a camera in your hand. Take some new pics. 

3. For Photos, always go shot-for-shot. This means:
    - If you choose not to show a photo and message someone who has a photo, your first couple of messages should include an equal photo of yourself. If he has a face pic, be prepared to send a face pic. If he has a torso pic, be prepared to send a torso pic.
   - If you are exchanging photos with someone, try your best to match what they provide you. If you don't have face/dick/body shots, say so up front. 

4. Be up front about why you're on grindr. 

5. If you're on grindr to chat and meet friends, don't be offended if someone wants to hook up. 

6. If you're on grindr to hook up, don't be offended if someone only wants to chat or make friends.

7. Hang up the racist hang-ups. (I'm interested to know what others think on this one.) If you aren't into a certain race, keep that information to yourself. 

8. When rejecting someone on grindr, do not insult them, but do not lie to them. If you're unsure how to end a conversation, something along the lines of ""We're not a match,"" usually works well. 

9. If you aren't interested in someone, block them. There's only so many squares that can fit on a screen. ",,True,nsfw,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_16g8wk,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/16g8wk/lets_make_a_grindr_etiquette_guide/,

(The Twink Delusion) (Rant Esq.),Orowam,39,10,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/11ltss/becoming_myself_the_twink_delusion_rant_esq/,"Hey guys, I'm gay but not out (technically?) and I have always had a thing for twinks. I also am not fortunate enough to have a body like a typical twink. Herein lies my personal struggles.  I want to be a twink because I like them.

I think I recently stumbled upon a great piece of the homosexual psyche that is a key factor in self awareness and self esteem. I decided to call it the Twink Delusion. I am a male who loves male. It is said that one of the highest forms of attraction/adoration/affection is emulation or copying. I as a person assumed that all other people would like me only if i looked like someone I would like. This is drastically increased by the fact that as a male, it is not unlikely to see oneself with a build found personally attractive to the individual. This can slam confidence in the face on account of never being able to live up to the person in your dreams that you see in every person you find attractive.

I finally broke through the Twink Delusion, and remembered that there's a market for everyone, no matter their physical body or skills. No matter their intelligence or charm. Every person grows to become who they are meant to be, and who they chose to be. After all, it's our choices that make us. Striving to change yourself is good, but don't let yourself get caught in the Twink Delusion.

Just a bit of a rant. Similar stories, experiences, etc. welcome. Just felt like i should share my personal breakthrough lest it help someone else.",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_11ltss,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/11ltss/becoming_myself_the_twink_delusion_rant_esq/,

Except it appears I am now the best man.,RedGreenBlueEditor,34,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/ygi0t/my_buddy_told_me_he_didnt_want_me_as_his_best_man/,"One of my best friends is getting married in December. I've been there for him through a lot. Following a devastating breakup, I helped him reunite with his girlfriend and supported them as they got back on their feet as a couple. When he decided to propose, I assisted in every detail of the engagement, even helping him to design the ring and photographing the proposal. 

At the time, he told me he wanted me in the wedding but said another close friend would be his best man. It would be weird, he said, to have a gay best man, and mentioned he wanted a ""straight"" bachelor party, which he said might make me uncomfortable. I told him I understood. 

A couple months ago, the guy he'd asked to be his best man pulled a total dick move at his own wedding that virtually ended any semblance of a friendship between them. I was sad to see them bitter and angry at each other. To be supportive, I continued to help him and his fiancée with their wedding details but didn't ask who would assume responsibilities as best man. (Not that the title is important, but a clearly defined role makes planning simpler for everyone involved.)

Within the past few weeks, the bride-to-be informed me that I am indeed the best man — a conversation I expected to have with my buddy. I haven't brought it up with him, mostly because I'm reluctant to put him on the spot. There's nothing to get defensive about from his perspective, but I don't want to create drama in what's supposed to be a calm, smooth process for the couple. He's never said anything that would lead me to believe he has a problem with me being gay. I guess my quandary is whether I should bring it up at all. 

TL;DR - One of my best friends asked me to be in his wedding, but told me he didn't want me to be his best man because I am gay. Now his fiancée tells me I am indeed the best man, but my buddy and I have never talked about it. I don't know whether to bring it up or what to say.",,False,self,t5_2qhef,False,,,True,t3_ygi0t,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/ygi0t/my_buddy_told_me_he_didnt_want_me_as_his_best_man/,

He's been through hell dealing with doctor's appointments for his injured shoulder and with uncooperative insurance agents to get some money for a new vehicle. Today was particularly disappointing because we visited car dealerships and every car we looked at was great, except for one major dealbreaker (outside of price range, too much mileage, etc.). Then, the people at his pharmacy didn't fill out his non-narcotic painkiller prescription, even though he gave them the prescription last night.

So, tonight as he was lying in bed, miserable, I tried cheering him up. He's a very stubborn pessimist, so it's next to impossible. But I, ever the optimist, tried anyway. I told him, with great confidence, that we were going to get through this, and things would get better for us once we both finished our degrees and got well-paying jobs. He gave a sarcastic chuckle, then said, ""I love it when you're so..."" he made incoherent sounds, as if they would help him find the word he was looking for.

""Naïve?"" I offered.

""Yeah, that's it."" My heart sank. I know I'm emotional, sometimes overly so; I know I can be immature; I know I'm still a kid at heart. He didn't have to rub it in, though.

Then he said, ""Don't ever lose that.""

I gave him a big hug and kiss.

Before I began my song, I dedicated it to my boyfriend, Austin. Very few people knew I was actually gay, fewer knew I had a boyfriend, and absolutely no one there knew I was going to dedicate the song to him. It was a terrifying experience--to be honest I was shaking backstage just waiting for my turn to go on. In the end, my friends were so supportive. My favorite teacher, also the one who runs the talent show, came up to me when I got backstage afterwards and gave me a big hug. I started bawling AGAIN after having already balled when one of my best friends gave me a huge hug as soon as I exited the stage. It was nerve-wracking but the whole school has been so supportive of me. Even people who used to pick on me in middle school or people you would think naturally to be rather rude were giving me heart-felt praise. 
My biggest fear was how my parents would take it. They both knew I was gay and have known since June of 2012 but going public is a bit different. Thanks to God my mom was actually really proud of me and even my dad was okay in the end. I'm just grateful to all the other LGBT youth at my school whom I was to inspire. And I just want to share this in hopes that I can inspire others who may be nervous or apprehensive about coming out to their friends or family. It doesn't always have to be bad--I'm glad to say I got to see some love and support in humanity that day =]
I included the performance in my weekly ukulele show that week--sorry about that, but just fast forward to about 16:00 to see the song. I hope it can give you a little piece of mind =]

I grew up in a very strict religion. I was raised as a Jehovah's Witness. haha yup. I went knock-knock. ANYWAYS everyone that knew me, could tell I was gay. the religion had me deeply in denial making me feel I could be straight with gay feelings. I didn't wanna have sex with a girl. I only fantasized about being dominated by sexy men (gay much??) hahahaha. 

well I moved out at 19 to NYC (I was living in Maine) well come June, 2012. when I was 20. I finally accepted my feelings. I came out as bi. my family and friends were supportive. including my dad. I just wasn't able to act on it because of the religion. I got tired of denying myself sex with a guy and hooked up with one in August 2012. 

I didn't wanna live a lie so I confessed my sins and got kicked out of the religion because I wasn't repentant. I loved having a cock in my mouth how could I be sorry??? lol. 

now all of my family loves me except my dad, brother, and sister in law. I'm dead to them since I left the religion. (they're the only ones that are witnesses). my mom and everyone else in my family accepts me %100.

moral of the story "" be who you are, and say what you feel. those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind"". just be honest to yourself. and to those that really love you.

1343668832.0,29,self.gay,xeems,"I think I just changed someone's life. /r/Gay, What's a story where you feel like you made an impact of someone. ",abradic95,36,7,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/gay/comments/xeems/i_think_i_just_changed_someones_life_rgay_whats_a/,"So at 1:30 last night, I was feeling pretty low and bored, so I went on chatroulette for the first time thinking I was just going to see dicks &amp; stuff, which was semi-true. So for about 2 hours on the site just shuffling through people and dicks I come across this guy. He says hey so I say hi back. He seems like a normal, decent guy just trying to find some company.  He has a nice smile, clean cut hair, nice physique. So we start having light conversation, you know, the usual stuff. 


I find out he is a drunk 18 year old guy with nothing better to do than waste time on chatroulette on a sunday night. He tells me he's into philosophy so we start talking a little bit about that. After a good half-hour and good conversation he tells me he's atheist which blows my mind because (not trying to be prejudice) he has a (albeit cute) southern accent and lives under the bible belt out of all places. 

I answer back that I am too so we start talking a little bit about this. Keep in mind this is the first real conversation I've ever had with anyone on chatroulette. I start talking about what it's like over where I live, another southern state close to his. How it's actually semi-liberal at least with people 30 and under. I mention how the town next to mine has some gay parades and how a lot of the youth are pretty open minded and atheist like myself. He mentions how he's been to houston and that his girlfriend dragged him to a gay parade there which was pretty fun. 

But he talks about the outskirts of houston and how it's completely the opposite there. By this time we've sort of got to know each other a little bit so he quietly says, ""I've....I've never told anyone this, but my dad would disown me if he ever knew i tried anything with THAT."" I instantly get the message but don't really stay on the subject in hopes  to not make him uncomfortable. All I say is, ""haha man, no judgement."" 

He tells me he's never confessed that to ANYONE, not even himself. So I let it go and he tells me about his life. I tell him about mine about how I'm 17 going into my senior year of high school and I lightly mention how about a month ago i came out to my parent's about my sexuality. 

He's mind blown by this, asking to repeat myself in case he heard wrong, and how he would've never guessed. Then he goes silent for a while. I notice he tries to say something but hesitates. So I say, ""hey man, I'm all ears."" So because he doesn't want to say it, he types,
""I'm bi
and i can't even say that."" 

By this time things are getting pretty emotional. I'm shaking and I think he might be too. He can't believe he has never said this to anyone, not even his friends, and he just told some stranger on chatroulette. He has never said those words. I tell him that he can always talk to me and even thought I just met him a few hours ago, I tell him how i care about him. 

So we talk about that and I tell him about my coming out story and how good it was. He tells me how his dad has Alzheimer's and his mind is still stuck in the 1930's when they would hang blacks and gays. After a few more hours talking, he still can't believe what happened. He kept saying ""this is crazy, what are the odds."" 

Basically to end it all, he asks me to friend him on facebook in case he needs anyone to talk to about coming out and because he's been dealing with depression and suicide, and I say of course. By this time it's 6:00am and we both know we should probably go but we don't want to. So I promise to him that we'll talk soon and I say goodbye and get offline thinking how I just changed a life, even if in a small way. And I still can't believe this happened. And it all started by being bored on a sunday night on chatroulette. 

TL;DR I go on chatroulette for the first time not expecting much. After two hours come across this guy and start talking. He ends up coming out to me, a complete stranger.
