Thinking I had a defective unit, I contacted Ploom, and explained the situation. They said they never heard of this issue before, and asked me to send them my unit for them to investigate. Ploom ends up sending me a brand new unit. Everything seems fine while I'm using it at home, and the first time I take it outside... SAME PROBLEM! I start thinking ""WTF?! it can't be the unit, it has to be something in the case."" Then one day when loading my Pax into the pouch, as I'm closing it, I notice the light turn on! I quickly realize that the flap inside the pouch that uses a magnet to keep it closed is the culprit! Placing a magnet onto the LED indicator turns the unit on even with the mouth piece retracted!

1373541452.0,119,self.vaporents,1i2nv0,Debunking the 'small hits are more efficient' myth,electrophile91,133,14,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1i2nv0/debunking_the_small_hits_are_more_efficient_myth/,"Almost every day on vaporents I see some allusion to the fact that bigs hits are inefficient. People claim the mflb is the most efficient vape because it forces you to take multiple small hits. People scoff at 'clouds' because they must be wasteful. Visible vapor is wasted vapor, after all. The assumption that 20 hits is more efficient than 2, however, has gone on long enough - it is time for it to be debunked. In order to arrive at a scientific conclusion, first a set of knowledge, assumptions and calculated data must be arrived at.


So without further delay. A dose of THC is roughly 5mg. It may be as large as, perhaps 25 mg, or as low as 1mg, but for the purposes of this thought experiment a 5mg THC dose is to be considered. This 5mg of THC produces approximately 5ml of THC vapor, 5ml of CO2 and 20ml of other cannabinoids and gas-phase resins. Assuming a hit to be approximately 1 litre in size (a rather conservative estimate), and that the whole dose is vaporisable in one hit, newly formed gases make up approximately 3% of your hit, approximatey 1/3rd of which is THC. Your lungs have a surface area of 70 square metres. 


So far, this information does not really tell us much about the comparitive efficiency. What it does tell us however, is that the lungs - even from a large hit - are by no means 'saturated' with THC. Every single cell on your lung surface is capable of absorbing THC through its cell-membrane, as well as the capability of vast uptake via your blood's plasma proteins. There are no ""THC-transporter"" cells. This means that from the point of view of each THC molecule, there is no queue. No THC molecules are turned around by any others. They are all free to enter into your body. A study on the Volcano vaporizer ([link](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16637053)) determined that after 10s, 65% of inhaled THC was absorbed. That is to say, 35% of THC is exhaled after 10s. This is nice, because it corresponds with the e-folding time; making the construction of **[this graph](http://i.imgur.com/ItLgkNz.png)** incredibly easy. As with any natural concentration-dependent process, where there is no speed-limit apart from the rate of diffusion - this decrease of THC in the lungs must be characterised by an exponential decay. (Wiki quote from the page on exponential decay: ""It is found that many administered substances are distributed and metabolize according to exponential decay patterns""). As a result, wastage (as a percentage) is irrespective of dose. 10 second hits consistently waste 35% of your THC, whether your hit was tiny or huge. So the fraction of wasted THC is independent of dose, or number of hits, and simply depends on how long you hold your hits. Some would argue that it easier to hold small hits because large ones are harsh. Some would argue that it's easier to hold one large hit for 30s than to do that 20 times with far smaller hits. What I do know, however, is that you cannot stop elimination of THC, and taking more than 5 minutes over a session means that (tolerance-dependent) a reasonable portion of your first hit will have been eliminated by the time your final hit is really kicking in.


So why does 1 big hit involve more visible exhaled vapor than 20 small hits? Visible vapor is a result of the saturation state of the air. The bigger the hit the more saturated the air, forcing more water-vapour and resin-vapour back into their liquid states. We see this as visible vapour. If the air is not particularly saturated, it can happily contain the THC without forcing any back into its liquid state. Hence tiny hits give no visible vapor. The highly saturated air from a large hit may also have a favourable effect in the lungs, 'pushing' the THC into the blood, at a rate faster than indicated by the graph. This is unknown, but a possibility. It does not mean that more THC has been wasted.
I understand this goes against the grain and welcome any scientific argument against it. Until such time, however, can we stop telling people who like clouds that they're wasting THC, because they ain't (as long as they've held it down for a bit). Most importantly, which can be seen from the graph, is how much more effective 20 seconds of 'holding' are compared to 5. Hold your hits people. 

**tl;dr there's no reason why small hits are more efficient than big hits, and everything is dependent on how long you hold each hit - see [this graph](http://i.imgur.com/ItLgkNz.png)**

I'm doing it in a spreadsheet and exporting it to a .pdf (edit: now I'm just using it in HTML form), as a Reddit table will have trouble with a large number of columns.

I can do the spreadsheet work, but I need content.  

Firstly what I'm wondering is whether there are more columns that could be added for other properties, features and superpowers of these vapes.  And have I missed any brands that deserve a place here?

As for the vapes, please, pick your favourite units, and suggest (and perhaps discuss) what info could go in the boxes in their respective rows.  Any contributions would be very appreciated.

I'll update this post, as well as the table, as progress is made.

Price matched at $139, and the website showed IN STOCK.  14 hours after ordering, I get an email saying it is BACK ORDERED.  When I looked at their site, it still showed as being in stock.

When I called them, I spoke to a very nice girl named Laura.  She said it is out of stock, but had 1001 excuses as to why they don't show it being out of stock, one being they can't order if they don't sell them.  I was a bit put off by the excuses, and I still don't have an ETA.

I would like to recommend that no one, NO ONE use gotvape.com until they get their shyte together.  Saying it is in stock, then telling you it is back ordered, then still showing in stock on website, that is plain sketchy and shady.

There are other options that are cheap out there, vote with your wallet...do not support  thieves and liars.  I would have no problem with a back order, if they were honest about it, but showing it in stock, then saying it is back ordered, while still showing in stock is simply a lie.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,extremeq,True,t3_1bgwtp,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1bgwtp/bad_scene_with_gotvape/,

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14zd0r/got_busted_need_advice/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14z721/got_caught_a_message_to_new_ents/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14kak6/well_today_it_happened_i_was_arrested_for_using/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14hker/just_got_caught/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/14eiyg/well_ents_i_could_use_some_help_right_about_now/).

The first two were from today alone, which was enough to prompt me to write this submission.  I really should have done so when I saw the first one, but now I can't leave it any longer.

So I feel it should be made absolutely clear that a vape does *not* make you invincible.  While the odour of vapour may be like night and day next to smoke, it *does* have an aroma, and enough of one that at least some RA's and campus cops are noticing it.  I guess the word about vapes may have got around in their professional circles.

Now I'm well aware that it doesn't matter what anyone says to you, some of you will choose to vape in your dorms anyway.  So please, if you are going to do such a thing, make a [sploof](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ev2mLRljxBE) or get a [smoke buddy](http://www.4aceswholesale.com/cart/images/SmokeBuddy%202.JPG) or some such device to exhale into, to absorb the remaining vapour (hey, even one of your pillows will do).

1361988399.0,63,self.vaporents,19c8d6,MFLB vs Pax: What you need to know,vapin,67,4,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/19c8d6/mflb_vs_pax_what_you_need_to_know/,"Correct me if I'm wrong but these seem to be the 2 most popular and highest rated handheld vapes on the market right now. I have them both and I really love them both for different reasons.

Convenience is huge for all portable vapes. I give the edge to the MFLB because although you do have to bring batteries and you do need a finer grind (MF finishing grinder works GREAT and fits right onto the chamber; loading the Pax is a pain in the ass and is messy.) My 2 main reasons for choosing the MFLB are the quick heating (4-5 seconds) and the ability to take one puff at a time. Pax is more for sessions and it's just not plausible to get more than 2 out of the oven (3 if you're a real lightweight i guess.) Point: MFLB

Vapor Quality definitely goes to the Pax. Although both give me very satisfying hits that fulfill my desire to smoke, the Pax has a better vapor density with a cooler delivery. MFLB makes me cough and I'm a veteran ent who doesn't cough from blunts. I found little to no learning curve with either; but again, I'm a savvy ent.. Point: Pax.

Stealth is super important to me. Edge Pax, easily. I have been arrested and gone through 18 months probation so if I do smoke outside of my own home I want to feel as safe as possible. The Pax barely isn't covered by my fist when I'm vaping. MFLB has to be shaken, has an odd shape when assembled, and has a viewable chamber. Point : Pax.

Novelty would have to go to the MFLB. This is a super cool, super simple product. They don't use any weird questionable components like cheap ceramic (jury still out?) or fiberglass. You just can't go wrong. Also the finishing grinder and the message of ""Love"" on the back are just neat and speak to the quality of the brand. The Pax is very sleek and effective but it has little novelty; and party mode seems to be hard for some people to activate (myself included.) Point: MFLB

Reliability is a huge factor I think. The Pax cost me 267 dollars with tax at my local head shop and within 1 week the mouth piece was not always recognizing and I'm still constantly fidgiting with it to make contact. I also get pretty nasty gunk out of it when i clean it every few days and as a stoner I'm annoyed that I'll have to pick up new cleaning products soon. The MFLB is so simple and I know the batteries don't last terribly long but it works exactly how it's supposed to. The Pax has been out long enough and costs enough money that they should have improved this and they also should have produced accessories by now. Edge: MFLB

ABV quality goes hands down to MFLB because you can absolutely control how dark it gets. Both can combust, but Pax does not have a viewable chamber and can easily darken flower on medium. Some ents weigh this VERY highly! I suggest using the ""low"" setting with a finer grind for the Pax for those ABV lovers! Edge: MFLB

You may think I'm going to give it away to the MFLB here but I'm not. 4-2 in my categories, half the price... What gives? In my opinion there is no substitute for vapor quality and stealth. The Pax is absolutely the better product if you're a paranoid ent like me who just wants to feel confident in their habit.                       

Hope this helps any new vapor ents! Happy Vaping!!!!



TLDR: Both products kick ass but if you can afford either but only one take the Pax.

I have had mine for about 2 months and here is what I have learned through research and experimentation 

* At the end of a session don't close the mouth piece until the unit is cool completely. This stops gunk from cementing around the mouth piece area causing it to stick. So power off the pax by letting it sit in standby until it powers it self down.

* Clean the inner tube with moist( NOT DRIPPING WET) pipe cleaner that has been dampened with 90%+ iso alcohol. 

* If the temperature color flickers when you have the mouth piece in and the pax is clean, blow for about 3 seconds into each side of mouth piece and reinsert. 

* Though its recommended the oven be full i have had success with half packs. You just need to tamp and stir the material a couple times in the session. Also be aware the clouds will be smaller and the herb may vape faster.

**Edit 1:** 

* Keep the pax mouth piece facing up/vertical when device is hot. This prevents gunk from getting to the mouth piece. 

* To clean the mouth piece good, take a glass and fill it with ISO, then let the mouth piece soak as long as you want. Then rinse well with water. 

* Over time the screen will collect stuff. ISO and steel wool and q tips can get it looking new.

1375693717.0,52,self.vaporents,1jqbgy,What really annoys me about letting people vape for the first time...,Myromaniac,69,17,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1jqbgy/what_really_annoys_me_about_letting_people_vape/,"My whole circle of friends consists of a majority of diehard smokers/tokers. We've been smoking joints and blunts for years. I never really particularily enjoyed smoking, especially since around here we smoke spliffs. 

Anyway, I already was a fan of vaping eversince I tried a tabletop bag vape some years ago, but for some reason I always thought you had to buy a $500 Volcano to really get the true vaping experience. (what marketing does to people...). The portables were the true eye opener for me. Vaping made easy, and especially proof that you don't need a bulky home setup to get just as high. 

Anyway, I mostly vape these days. And I find (still do) that it takes me back to the days where I had my first weed experiences, everything was tingly, clear, fun, and I was high as balls in those days. After years of smoking, the combustion high really loses much of it's flavor, and it rarely stays in your head long enough (depending on the bud and tolerance of course). I even got pretty bored of that particular high, because it didn't really bring me much joy anymore. 

So, in order to limit my smoking to an absolute minimum, I have a masterplan. Since weed is a social drug, and most of my friends smoke, I had to make them as enthusiastic about vaping as I am. It's weird getting your vape out and not passing joints after all these years. I must say that I've had quite some succes: 4 of my friends have bought a vape because I ""converted"" them. They haven't entirely made the switch, but it's getting more and more ""normal"" to get the vape out. Which is nice. 

I love sharing the vape experience, and those that did a true vape session with me all were very impressed. I think it's really the *epiphany* most hardcore tokers need to re-evaluate their smoking habits. I also find it's more economic, as you don't need as much to get more high AND you don't get that rat reflex of chain toking. 

However, there are some that have this irrational *resistance*, and it bugs the shit out of me. I don't want them to stop smoking, that's not my business, but what really annoys me is the following, and I'm sure a lot of you ents will relate:

They take a drag, then maybe another one, then pass it back. Ok so far... Then they tell me it *doesn't work*. Are you shitting me? You smoke copious amounts of bud, and then complain that you don't get high *off a few little puffs* What did you expect, Sherlock? It's still green... I think it's mostly weird for them to not taste the smoke. Worst part is that I can't even let them finish the bowl, because by then they'll be rolling a joint.

Yesterday this happened again, I don't really get why. I think it's because people don't like questioning their habits. Rolling a joint is a fantastic ritual, but I enjoy it much more in moderation. 

**tl;dr: The fact that some people who try vaping for the first time take a few drags and then declare vaping doesn't work really annoys me. I don't get the resistance, it's almost as if they write it off before they actually try it. Anyone else have this experience?**",,False,self,t5_2upjd,1375698211.0,,,True,t3_1jqbgy,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1jqbgy/what_really_annoys_me_about_letting_people_vape/,

(please upvote for visibility),Bit_Chewy,47,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1dse1c/meta_new_look_new_posting_guidelines_please/,"We have some new [posting guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/wiki/postingguidelines) to help us cut down on the noise here.  Regulars will know that we get a lot of the same types of questions, some less-than-interesting images, and a few other low-information posts.  So we'll try and tighten things up a little, without getting too oppressive about it.

And as you can see, we also have a new header (ie Snoo the Reddit alien with his placard and the fluffy vapour text) and a banner to go with it.  The new header is thanks to Fresh_Baked, who tweaked his original image after a few suggestions - I think it gets the point across nice and effectively.  And the sky and clouds are thanks to some random person on the internet whose photo I've stolen off Google Images and cropped.

Mind you, these images aren't set in stone, and if any graphically inclined members wish to come up with their own vapour-themed images, you're welcome post it to see if it gets the community's approval.  There's nothing stopping us having several schemes on rotation to keep things interesting.  But make sure whatever Snoo is up to is clear at a reduced size.  And if you have a banner image, be sure it's at least 2816 pixels wide and not too grainy, for the benefit of very high resolution monitors.  Also, make sure the bottom left of any banner isn't likely to make it difficult to see the header.  

I'll probably keep experimenting with banners, at least.  The clouds in the sky motif seemed an appropriate one - vapour, being high, being clean and clear (certainly relative to smoke). So I might look for a few more clouds, though I have a couple of other ideas as well.  And in the fullness of time, more CSS will be added, which will mean more imagery, too.

Edit for Directions Insertion!:

Alright, motherfuckers, here's the deal.  I'm not going to claim this, put my name on it, or try to say it was all my own idea.  But I am going to give you the directions, that's for sure.

First off, I'm a normal MMJ user that depends on his meds daily.  I use multiple containers for different strains, loose keif/hash, the occasional edible from the dispensary, a coffee grinder as my main grinder (I have a very simple 2 piece for my smokables), and the piece de resistance, a 3rd gen Arizer Extreme Q.  I use it with a whip attachment that allows me to play Forza and puff away.

I'm also like most MMJ patients in that I am broke as fuck, and have to be very thrifty with my herb.  I have to use every part of the buffalo, and make sure that I stretch it all as far as possible, every time.  And with this experiment, I was able to do just that.

There's a couple parts to this, so bear with me.  I'm still flying since the last dose last night (about 14 hours ago), so I'm not the most clear thinker right now.

**Part 1: Clean that Muthafucking vape!**

I mean all of it.  What you're going to want to do is ensure you're using the right materials.  I use a glass Mason jar filled with 99% pure Isopropyl alcohol.  Keep it in there.  Don't get rid of it.  This is your bath for your vape parts, any tools that you use for cleaning (I have a small wire contraption that I made myself that is a stirring wand on one side, and a pipecleaner laden ""q-tip"" inspired end for wiping out my Q's bowl, that is just small enough to fit in the little hat / elbow filter, and twirl around.  This means that I can also use this piece for cleaning almost all of my parts, except hoses.  For those, if they need agitation, I use a long pipecleaner concoction that I made by braiding them into a 2 foot long master pipecleaner.  This makes sure it can reach past the middle of both of my whips, so I can clean it from both ends.

Once my vape is dirty, usually 3-4 days of use (or after running a gram per night plus hash through it), it gets disassembled.  The bowl, both screens, the elbow piece, and any connectors go into the bath, along with my cleaning tool.  They soak for as long as needed in the bath, usually 15 to 60 minutes depending on how lazy I am.  Then, clean them with whatever you do - I use my little q-tip ended tool to wipe the inside of the bowl. scrub the screens, and the first part of the elbow piece.  Then, use a pipecleaner to clean the small end of the elbow.  After this, I rinse them with water, and dry with paper towel.  If you're wanting to be exceptionally thrifty, you can always take the water that you're using to rinse and make a batch from that so that you can save the precious THC soaked alcohol from the pieces.  Conversely, you can also clean the vape pieces by pouring Iso into them, letting it soak for a minute or two, and then dump that into your bath, and then clean it - the advantage to this is that the bath becomes less potent at cleaning as it soaks up THC and other goodies.  

I then clean my hoses as well in the same manner, sometimes using the Iso directly in them, and dumping any liquids into the bath.  From there, I use the master pipecleaner to agitate and fully clean, then rinse that off, as well as my tools, into the bath.

Cleaning is done!

**Part 2:  Saving AVB**

Pretty self explanatory, but one thing I want to point out is that if you're using q-tips to do your cleaning, I suggest making yourself a tool for less than 5 bucks to take its place.  I bought some small gauge craft wire and pipecleaners to make mine, and shaped it to fit my vape parts.  Now, I know that you're thinking I just use it for cleaning, but it does have another purpose.  Dry cleaning.  No, not the clothes.

What I do is take my little q-tip tool, and when I have a bowl that needs to be emptied, I dump it out into my AVB container.  From there, I use my **dry** q-tip thingy to *wipe* the inside of the bowl to get all of the bits out, and then I clean out the top hat with it as well, as this thing fits perfectly.  I just put it into the little hat, and spin it in my fingers to clean it out.  

This has a couple of benefits:

-It keeps your bowl cleaner for longer, as well as the top hat.
-Your fresh bowl will taste better.
-You'll be able to save the kief/small bits that get otherwise get stuck in q-tip.  
-There's no waste.  In the last year of using this tool, I have only replaced the pipecleaner end once.  I would have gone through a billion q-tips in that time.

Now that you're saving all of your AVB, be sure to keep it in an airtight container in a dark cool place.

**Part 3: Cooking!**

Now that you've got a jar of Iso that couldn't take another washing (you'll know when this happens - it will neither pass light through it, and it will not be usable for cleaning anymore.  When you have this, it's time to cook.

**First:** Take all of your AVB and powder it.  More surface area exposed, the better the extraction.  Who cares if it makes your grinder dirty, it's worth it.  Then add it into an appropriately sized container - preferably glass - and then add your Iso bath to it.  Let this sit for a couple of minutes, make sure it is nicely mixed up, and then it's time to strain.

**Second:** Strain it all.  You may need a second set of hands depending on your set up, but I would advise doing a double strain.  By that I mean strain once through a good chunk of cheesecloth, then make sure to squeeze every last drop you can out of it into your bath.  Then, take your Iso bath and strain it through a doubled up coffee filter.  Doubled so that it's stronger, and a coffee filter to make sure you get the fine particles.  Then again make sure to squeeze as much as you can into your bath, reclaiming as much of the liquid as possible.

**Third:**  Make a double boiler, using your bath in a glass or stainless steel container.  I prefer to use my small crockpot with a smaller stainless bowl I bought for it, that basically sits right on top.  I do this because I like to see all of my liquid evaporate, and slowly add more bath.  This does take some time, and the alcohol part is not the best smelling when heated.  I advise doing this outside if possible, or at least make sure your workspace is well ventilated, and of course WATCH THE FUCK OUT, IT'S 99% ALCOHOL.  Avoid smoking a bowl ANYWHERE near this.

**Fourth:** After the liquid has evaporated, grab some hot water.  I mean like a kettle full of boiling water,  and use this to get all of your oily goo off the sides of your container.  If you pour it on the inside of the container, you can evaporate it off using the double boiler again.  If you use it on the outside of the container, the goo will heat and slide easier.  I use an old credit card for scraping it down the edges, then boil off the water again, and while heated, transfer to it's final resting space.

**Fifth:**  Your end result should be a dark brown goo with **NO** liquidy parts.  You do not want **ANY** Iso or water in this, as Iso is not good for you to swallow, and water will induce mold faster.  It may even look black, but it should be very thick.

**Sixth:**  Cap that stuf up.  I use a spoon to scoop the goo out of the container, and then I heat the spoon with a lighter to make the goo a bit more pliable.  This allows me to take a capsule and press the open end of one side to scoop oil into.  From there, I can scrape the goo off the spoon, and using the lighter make sure that it is pliable enough to all come off while ensuring the spoon doesn't become heated to the point of vaporizing  or burning the goo.  If you hear crackling, you're burning it.

**Seventh:** Enjoy the fruit of your labour.  Start small.  My first few doses were just a drop, and culminated in a great evening.  And a great day after.

**Eighth and Final:**  Keep them in the fridge, or the freezer to keep them fresh.  Mold can and will grow depending on how well you've done these steps.  It takes about 3 weeks for mold to set in, so if you're not able to freeze/refridgerate, make sure you consume.

I have been surviving on these caps **ALONE** since the 27th of last month.  By the time I run out, I will have been running on these for 3 weeks straight, with no bud, no kief, no hash, no other edibles.  And that time has been spent superdosing on a lot of days to test these out.  I likely could have made them last double that if I had tried.  Next time.  Pfffffttt..... right....   I usually have to vape or smoke for migraines, as edibles usually don't have enough THC in them to actually kill my migraines, just lessen them slightly.  For me to have survived this long without smoking or vaping has been a nice break.  I had saved my bath for about 8 months, and only added 1 ounce of AVB as I had just finished making edibles out of my saved AVB the month previous.  I would like to add a lot more next time to reclaim more CBD/CBN for body pain, but that's all part of the learning experience, right?

Anyway, my hands are dead.  I'm switching to my tablet, fire any questions that you may have at me!  And thanks for reading! :D

***********************************************************************************

Why you ask?  Because, motherfuckers.  I'm high as a kite.  I'm not so sure I'm actually physically attached to the Earth by a tether, either.  And that's why you need to know what I did to get this way.

But wait!  Billy Mays here with another exciting - hooooooooly fuck did my fingers just fing or was that my tablet's screen - discovery.  I can't write the guide to this tonight.  But I promise to amend this in the morning or afternoon.  

I'm a MMJ patient with a ridiculous tolerance.  Last time I was orbiting like this I had eaten an ounce of very potent AVB over the course if several hours.  This is  better.  What I have done is use every part of the buffalo when it comes to my Extreme Q and AVB stash, and transformed them into the thickest, nastiest, most potent oil, which is of course orally bioavailable.  And then cap them.  Typical dose for me has been about 1g in a ""00"" capsule.  And they are AMAZING.  I will not be going to any other method at this point as these are the most punch per size unit ever.  And talk about stealth, provided you have the space to prep them.

And you may ask, what did I do tonight?  I popped a second cap.  :D  I just wish I had thrown all of my AVB in to gain more CBD/CBN for body pain, but I have been 90% migraine free for 2 weeks.  Unfucking heard of for me, they're usually daily and not good.  But these caps just kick it's ass.  And one cap lasts me 18 to 24 hours.  Think of the potential for those of you with a significantly lower tolerance, small caps with a mere drop of oil for less time (I prefer to overload receptors and let it process overnight for that nice happy day after).

I uh...  I'm going to stop rambling and go back to reading a Mark Tufo zombie novel by flashlight in the walkin closet in the dark - not fucking kidding, and yes, it is as awesome as it sounds.

I recently purchased the Pax Ploom but feel as though I am not getting the most out of it. I say this mainly in regards to not knowing how to take the most efficient and proper hit. I have read/watched so many things online but still feel the tiny details of this process have been only glazed over. I was hoping to get some really good (detailed) advise on what to do once this baby is packed and the light rolls from purple to green.

In addition to your responses, I was just wondering if people could briefly throw in their opinions/experiences on what it's like getting high with the Pax—How many hits to get you high? How long does it take to set in? How does the high compare to combustion? Why is a typical session like for you?

Thanks so much guys! I truly appreciate this community and all the help and guidance it offers!

I saw that the PAX takes up more of your stash and gives denser hits. But isn't vaporizing not having the physical smoke present? And since it takes up more of your stash than the MFLB, shouldn't I just stay physically smoking instead of vaping (amount of stash being used-wise)?

And then there's the MFLB. Small and portable, but buying the adapter and extra batteries puts it at basically the same price as the PAX. I also read that the MFLB are for minimal drags so a lot of people don't get as medicated as they wished. 

I also want the more discreet and the less odor vaporizer because I'd like to vape outside.

So I'm stuck between those two. Any help would be appreciated!",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_15dist,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/15dist/pax_vs_mflb_confused_and_need_to_come_to_a/,

It wasn't a big deal at first, and cleaning the Pax resolved the issue, but over time it seems to happen more frequently, and I feel like I'm cleaning this thing constantly.

The reason this was happening was because I was putting the Pax on the charger right after my session, while it was still warm, so all the oils and resins inside were dripping down towards the mouthpiece, and then cooling there into a gunk that causes the mouthpiece to stick.

MassDrop has the following tonight on Canadian shipping and the sale.

From Will of MassDrop tonight:

*I'll shoot planet vape an email, we'll see if we can get the Canadian fulfillment setup and hopefully get a listing for the HES as well : )*

*I'll have to do some math for EU shipping but proper international is going to be more expensive*

Means it might just work out for us Canadians!

Oh, and the sale?

Will of MassDrop again tonight:

*Alright ladies and gentlemen!*

*We'll be launching the Arizer solo tomorrow at 1pm PST (4pm EST). Arizer is only offering black units this time around but they are the latest model and we'll be able to maintain the same prices we had last time.*

*Prepare your wallets. Tomorrow we launch*

MassDrop Poll - https://www.massdrop.com/vote/summer-2013-arizer-massdrop-sale/

There are other pieces in the sale, such as replacement stems, PVHES, multi voltage charger, stealth cup, EQ, and more.  Add any items you're interested, a lot of us want to add accessories!

I'll update as soon as the Drop is up, starting price is 128.61USD.  Last time with 119 buyers it went for $119.95.  With more than double that, hopefully we should be able to get it lower than that. 

Arizer only has black units at this time, personally my choice for better stealth and wear.  Not sure if they will have silvers later on.

Thanks for your support everyone!  Couldn't have been done without you and the crowd at FC, they have also been approved of this.

I will respond to confirm, adding your name to our numbers!**

**Current Vaporents Registered : 45!** Updated 6:02 PM Aug 12, 2013 PST

**All updates at the bottom of OP!  Stay tuned!**

Hello Vaporents!


As promised, here is the official thread!  This will be used for tracking the group buy, the retailers that we contact, and the ensuing communication trail in the interests of transparency.


First off, if you are interested in this, we are going to attempt **two different avenues of attack**.  The first is that we are going to send retailers a letter via email explaining our intentions, and we've included the letter further down.  The second avenue is via Massdrop.com.  We urge all of you interested to go to MassDrop and register (easy as entering an email and password), and then vote for interest in the Arizer Solo.  They currently sit at 111 interested people, and I've posted a link back to what we're doing here should people on MassDrop not want to wait and join us.


If MassDrop comes through within our timeframe, we'll compare that price to the prices get quoted from retailers and then decide as a group by a vote what way we'll go.  We have 28 individual units currently spoken for, and that's in the first day of this.  As you all know, a group buy works best when the number of people is increased.  We have the ability to either influence MassDrop considerably, or to at least get a retailer to work with us as we currently represent around $3000 in sales for one business in one action.  This is a great opportunity for a business to get a decent bump in revenue for a day.


**MassDrop**

Go to MassDrop Arizer Solo Page - https://www.massdrop.com/buy/arizer-diffuser-solo?s=arizer%20solo - and register, as well as ""request"" the device on the right side of the page.


After organizing my thoughts, I've drafted the following letter:


*Greetings!*


*I'm writing to you on behalf of /r/vaporents, a community residing on popular social media site Reddit, dedicated to all things vaporizers.  We have been gauging interest amongst our community in doing a ""group buy"" through one vendor for one specific product: a 2013 model Arizer Solo.*


*Our community is located at http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents*


*For the sake of transparency:*


*Our discussion thread gauging interest in a group buy - http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1k42uq/looking_to_gather_interest_in_another_group_buy/*


*Our official discussion thread on the group buy in a nutshell -*


*Currently, we have 28 people that have committed, and are leaving registration open for the next 2 weeks to garner further attention.  As happens on Reddit, things grow.  We're hoping to increase the number of buyers to at least 75 to 100 people during that time, which with our various related communities is much more than possible.  As we're a community of enthusiasts, we will of course be doing our own version of internal advertising and raising awareness for this group buy, as everyone knows that getting more people involved allows you, the retailer, to work with us to create an optimal price.*


*Again, as we're trying to keep this as transparent as possible to both the potential buyers who have registered and you, the potential retailer that we are writing, the below is a quick explanation of our selection process.*


*We will be writing to a variety of retailers to give you the opportunity to give us your best price on our current amount of registered buyers, as well as potentially a scaled price to the amount of people that we are able to register in the next two weeks.*


*As this is a group buy and we have members internationally, we are looking to give priority to shops that are willing to work on shipping and handling costs to places like Canada and the European Union, as we've had registrants from as far as there.  Half of our current registrants are from Canada, so this is a very important aspect to this.  We have also had some interest from a couple members in Australia.  Our ideal retailer will have few challenges regarding international shipping to common First World countries.*


*At the end of the two week period, we will be selecting the top three retailers and voting as a community.  We're hoping to find a retailer who is able to provide us with a coupon code or similar idea that would allow us to track final orders so that we can have a finalized price for those people who do commit.*


*We should also mention that the last time we decided to do this as a community, the price was down to $119.95 via Massdrop.com.  The majority of our registrants have committed to a base price of $130USD.*


*If you are interested in a mutually beneficial relationship, please reply to us and let us know.  We are very excited to be doing this, as it gives us the ability to reward a customer focused business with a large order and support the economy at the same time.  A lot of us will likely be looking to get some extra accessories, so if you have the ability to provide us with some package deals that might include some basics, like a fine grinder, pass through charger, water filtration, or the like, or even a discount process for this, it would greatly sway our membership.*


*We will be posting all communications so that the registrants are able to see everything clearly to avoid confusion, and to allow competing retailers to potentially revise their offers over time should they want to follow along and see what their competitors have offered.*


*To sum up, our priorities are:*


*1. Best price on 2013 model (M1A4 serial numbered) Arizer Solo.*

*2. Ability to ship internationally to USA, Canada, Australia, and within the European Union.*

*3. A retailer who might be able to provide a couple basic accessory packages.  We can consult our community to determine these if need be.*


*Our apologies for the long email, we just want to make sure that everyone has all of the information that they need to make this a great success for everyone involved.  Thank you for reading, we all appreciate your time, and we look forward to hearing from you!*


*If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me back directly via email, or via the thread on Reddit.*


*Sincerely,*

*""MyName/Ialmostthewholepost""*

*Email: myname@gmail.com*
*Reddit User Link: http://www.reddit.com/u/ialmostthewholepost*


*PS - One of our members has posted this information up the FuckCombusion.com forums for further visibility -http://fuckcombustion.com/threads/arizer-solo.3833/page-701*


**If you have any input on the letter, please post up.  As well, if you have ideas on a retailer you want to see contacted, or are a retailer and are interested in supporting this, please post up or PM.**  


Those that have expressed interest have been noted, and will be PM'd towards this post.  I will be working on getting this cross posted to various subs this evening.


With that said, registration will close on Sunday, August 25th at midnight, or when I get up the next morning.  From there, I will be posting a thread on here with the top 3 prices/offers that we get, and then we as a community will vote on the retailer that we choose.  Again, if MassDrop is cheaper and on by that time, we will go that route.  I personally cannot wait any longer, hence why I'm taking this project on.  On Monday August 26th, voting will be open until Friday the 30th, unless we the community decide earlier.  Then, it's order time.  


**Help spread the word.  Mention it in threads where people are looking at getting a vaporizer, as this might just help our numbers swell.  Help keep it cross posted in related subs over the next couple of weeks.  If you are interested in helping with communications and relaying information in this thread, PM me.  I may need one or two people depending on the response to this by both registrants and retailers alike.  I use MMJ for chronic pain so this amount of typing takes a toll, but if it gets me a good price on a little brother for the EQ, then I'm all for it.**


Thank you all for your interest in this, let's keep it alive and good luck to all of us!

Edit:  **Just to be clear, the way that we are doing this buy is as follows (Aug 12, 4:25PM PST).**

1.  **Looking for retailers and gathering interest from now until August 25th!**

2.  **You will be purchasing from a retailer directly, just as you would with MassDrop - If MassDrop does not come through by that date.  We've influenced around 60 votes on that page since this started so...  yeah.  I'll be making contact with them tonight, just as I'm doing with other retailers.  No redditors nor myself will be touching your money.  Think of this as a flashmob with money for the retailer who gives us the best deal on a Solo/Solo packege(s).**

3.  **To register, reply to OP (me) in this thread!  I will reply back, adding your name to the list, and updating the number at the top of the thread of the total interest received via reddit thusfar.**

4.  **Any and all retailer communication as well as retailers contacted will be included in this thread for transparency.  All retailers are encouraged to compete.**

5.  **Once the 25th comes around, I will be creating a poll with our best options from the prices and quotes we've received.  We will vote as a community on these options.  I will be messaging all interested parties to ensure they get a link to the communication.**

6.  **WE ORDER OUR SOLO'S DIRECT FROM RETAILER WITH EXISTING STOREFRONT AND PAYMENT SOLUTIONS.  NO INTERACTION WITH REDDITORS OR OTHER NON SAFE METHODS OF PURCHASE.  WE NEED THIS TO BE LEGIT, BEWARE OF YOUR MONEY.  Now that I'm done yelling, I want to make sure that is clear.  I'm not doing this to get *your* money, I'm doing this to *save my money*.  That's how much this is worth it to me.**

**All updates will be below here, except for the amount of registered users at the top!  Stay tuned for details!**

Edit 1:  **MASSDROP UPDATE!!!**

Comments section of https://www.massdrop.com/buy/arizer-diffuser-solo?s=ariz

""Hey guys, we have heard you loud and clear. 

*We are working out details about the group buy, and are aiming to relaunch it shortly. Just stay tuned!"" - Nelson, of MassDrop*

I've replied in that thread for contact, and will hopefully have something for us tonight.  I will be withholding from contacting retailers until tomorrow afternoon to give MassDrop time to respond officially, as that seems to be the most popular route, and no doubt the CHEAPEST!  Will update as things come in!


Edit 2: Should also mention that the night we started this initiative, MassDrop only had 93 signatures on file.  The last MassDrop for Arizer Solo saw 119 completed sales.  We just hit 159 a couple minutes ago, and it's been growing quickly in the last 24 hours.  It's been mention on the FC forums, and I'm guessing spread.

1372147395.0,35,self.vaporents,1h0yo5,Does anyone else strongly dislike using the MFLB?,_quote,52,17,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1h0yo5/does_anyone_else_strongly_dislike_using_the_mflb/,"Warning: get ready for a wall of text

Disclaimer: while I am about to voice my complaints about the launch box, I am in no way bashing people who like it. The point here isn’t to convince people that other vapes are better than the MFLB, but only to share my problems with the launch box that most people I know don’t seem to mind at all for some reason. In fact, I am curious to hear from launch box lovers why they don't take offense to the things that I do, and maybe some of you can give me some tips on how I could enjoy the launch box more. 

Background: The launch box was my first vape and there have been long periods of time when I used it exclusively. I have never particularly enjoyed using it for the reasons which I am about to describe. I now use an Arizer Solo.

Let's jump right in. Things I dislike about the launch box:

The fact that the screen only vaporizers the bud that is in direct contact with it, resulting in the need to shake up the bowl every single time. This aggravates me on so many levels. The first is that no matter how finely I grind up my bud, the box never cooks the whole trench evenly. I can vape until there's very dark brown in the trench and there is still a lot of green. Because of this, I have to pour out the trench in my palm and crumble it all up with my fingers. Along with this being a hassle for various reasons (wind, getting hands smelly, etc) I lose a bit of bud each time I do this, so even if I started out with a full trench I am left with much less bud in the trench than I should have. In the end, it is just unnerving because I never feel like I've vaped a whole trench to completion.

Going along with that first point, it is so annoying when I'm trying to shake up the bowl, and some bud sticks to the screen so I have to open up the trench and unstick it myself. Having to do this is SO irritating.

Having to control the temperature with the speed of my breath. I am actually okay with the way that the launch box works, heating up and cooling down with each hit. I personally prefer the ""always on"" variety of vape but I understand that the MFLB's way of working is a bit more efficient. However, what I don't appreciate is that the circuit is completely unregulated so you have to use your breath to control the temperature. This self regulation adds a layer of concentration that makes me have to pay attention so that I'm not burning my weed, or just making it fly around in the trench. I think that it is extremely misleading that the launch box manual tells you to do all three of these things as follows:

1. Take hits that last 12-14 seconds

2. Draw like you are sipping tea

3. Do not draw faster than what will move the bud around in the trench. The bud should be stationary, and it won't produce vapor if it's blowing around.

You just can't do all of those. The only way to take a 14 second hit without combusting is to draw hard, which blows the weed around in the trench. The only way to draw like you are sipping tea is to take hits that are a fraction of that length. 

And the most annoying part of the whole breath regulated thing is, why does it have to be like that at all? Why can’t the MFLB limit the temperature that the box can reach? It could still heat up and cool down with every hit, but I am just positively baffled that they would make a vape that you have to use your breath to control the temperature. For any other vape you can inhale as slow as molasses for the whole load in one go you so desire. For the MFLB, if you inhale too slowly for an extended period of time, your weed will go up in flames. I want to this post to be as neutral as possible, but for this I have to step out of line. That is fucking retarded.

So yep, the last thing to say is the fact that combusting can occur at all. As a brass player who gets paid to use my lungs, this is the most important factor. Unlike any good vaporizer with a regulated temperature, the magic flight launch box can burn your weed. If you get too high and your concentration dwindles a little, or you hand your launch box to an inexperienced friend, it can char up your screen and fill the lungs of the user with foul, dirty, harmful smoke. Enough said.

That’s basically it. All in all, most of these things aren't that big of a deal on their own, but because they all add up, along with the fact that I have absolutely none of those issues with any digital portable like the Solo and the no2, I pretty much don’t use the launch box anymore. 

TL;DR: just read it. It takes 2 minutes.

Sorry if I complained a bit enthusiastically. Again, no offense to MFLB lovers. I will admit that in the end, the box is nearly as effective as say, the iolite or the pax. It's just the process of using the launch box that is extremely agitating to me. In a nutshell, using it feels like work. And the whole point of vaping weed is to not feel like you're doing work.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_1h0yo5,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1h0yo5/does_anyone_else_strongly_dislike_using_the_mflb/,

1. MFLB: Super useful for a quickie at a movie or something, but hard to teach others, a bit hard to use accurately and not exactly stunning performance.

2. Pax: Looks great, needs to be cleaned like constantly, I used a few times in one week and the mouthpiece needs to be held down gently in order for it to heat up. Decent vapor production, but not worth the cost. Also it just eats through herbs.

3. Puffit: Cool concept, decent vapor, poor flavor and just bizarre to use overall.

4. Arizer solo: Way smaller than I expected, seems like this is just as good as a desktop vape (or enough for me) but also portable enough, maybe not for a pocket, but any bag you carry can hide it easily. The flavour is outstanding, the useage of herbs is on par with the MFLB and the vapor it produces is fantastic, as are the effects. Its also nice that you can use ground or whole herbs!

There's the obvious car inverter solution, but I don't want to have my car on for 1.5hrs just to charge the Pax, nor will I always have access to my car. Enter the [Anker](http://www.amazon.com/Anker%C2%AE-Astro3-10000mAh-Multi-voltage-Output/dp/B005NGKR54/ref=cm_rdp_product).

The Anker is a portable battery with a 1.35mm DC connector that will fit in to your Pax charging station. It also has the option to output either DC 9V or 12V (Pax uses 9V.) Great! Well, one trick, the charging station opening is really small, and uses a right angle plug. My solution: get a PVC cutter (a saw will work best), saw off a small portion of your charging unit and boom, portable Pax charger. I don't see any concern for voiding the Pax's warranty as I haven't modified the Pax in any way, just the method in which the charging station receives power (Pax has publicly stated any 9V adapter can be used.) Total cost ~$60 (Anker + PVC cutter.)

Here's a couple photos of my Pax charging from the Anker, and what part I cut on the charging station: http://imgur.com/a/fcziR The 3rd photo shows the Pax fully charged. 

~~I'm not sure what the Pax's battery life is rated, so I don't yet know how many recharges you'll get out of the unit. I'm going to assume about 2-3. I will report back once I use it to that extent.~~

Edit: Thanks to d-cent, it looks like the Pax's battery is 2,600 mAh. The Anker is 10,000 mAh, so we can guarantee at least 3 full charges, and 75% of a 4th.

Missed out on the group buy a couple of months ago like me?  Jealous of other people on r/vaporents picking up a new 2013 model for $120?  I am.  I've been bidding my time, and am ready to order, and am wondering if there is anyone else interested in doing a group purchase.  Price goes down as more people buy in a group so if you're looking to purchase in the next **2 weeks** post within.  We can work together on contracting a few retailers to get the best price and possibly bundle, as I'm looking at getting the pass through charger for cheap immediately upon purchasing.

I can't stand reading any more testimonials from you happy Solo owners, my EQ needs a little brother, and I need a portable vape.

Edit 1: 10 people so far are ""in"", depending on price!

Edit 2:  Will be messaging people as soon as I have some information to share.  I will likely send out a quick message to anyone who has expressed interest to confirm numbers, as well as maybe a ""maximum"" price limit, so that we're all on the same page.

Edit 3: For any Canadians perusing this post, I have a high priority in making sure our import/shipping fees are as low as possible.  If you are looking to get a Solo, now is going to be one of the best times in the near future! :D  We always over pay on goods that come from the States!  Even though Arizer is Canadian...

(Please upvote for visibility.),Bit_Chewy,35,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1dl7vk/meta_what_posting_guidelines_should_we_have_here/,"I'm wondering what thoughts members here have regarding posting guidelines in this sub.  Are there certain types of submissions you're tired of seeing?  Are there particular kinds of posts you'd rather have removed?

To start with, there's been some mutterings about requests for vape recommendations clogging up this sub, such as this thread from today:  

http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1djzo9/a_strange_observation/

Now, you might have noticed that an announcement bar ('Please read the FAQ before asking a question') was added a couple of weeks ago, and the FAQ asks new arrivals to provide detailed information about their needs and habits before asking about what to buy.  It also asks to use the search function for information about specific vapes.

I've noticed some reduction in-low information questions, but there's still a few that get posted anyway, and sometimes there's a rush of them.  So should these guidelines be enforced?  Us mods could remove such submissions and inform the submitter to do a bit of reading first.  

But I don't wish to alienate anyone - many of you started out here with one of these low-information questions.  I'd like to maintain the friendly, welcoming, helpful vibe of this sub without it becoming tediously repetitive for regulars.  I've noticed that the number of people unsubscribing has grown in proportion to those subscribing, so we're growing slower than we were a few months ago.

Also, maybe there are certain types of comments, such as flaming, that you feel should be removed by us mods.  A great thing about subreddits is that they are mostly self-moderating due to the voting system, but perhaps outright personal abuse is something you think we can do without.  Though I certainly don't want to impede robust debate either.

And yeah, if you have any other suggestions, please, feel free to offer them for discussion.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,silversurfer,True,t3_1dl7vk,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1dl7vk/meta_what_posting_guidelines_should_we_have_here/,moderator

Right off the bat, the price is $150.00 and it is well worth the price of comfortably smoking out in public in any casual scenario without being obvious.

I have always been a big proponent for vaporizers, particularly for the health benefits. I recently received the Puffit as an Xmas present and couldn't wait to get to using it. 

First off the piece is very subtle, if you're going for discrete, this is a great product. It looks exactly like an inhaler used for asthma or any lung related medicines. I'm big into snowboarding, so when I first saw this, my first thought was to take it on the slopes and it was just what I hoped for. By holding the top button for 2 seconds, the Puffit initiates a 20-30 second burn sequence. My only worry was how badly did the Puffit create odors and I was surprised to find that it barely leaves a trail behind and the only way it leaves an obvious smell is if you initiate the burn sequence and someone is standing right next to you for more than 15 seconds. After the burn sequence is finished there is no smell, there is no smoke after you exhale and it does not smell after you're finished exhaling. So outside use is great, if you're ballsy enough you could use it in front of people and if prompted you could say you're using your inhaler. I've used it in the presence of people in the same room and no one bats an eye. No lighters needed!

The Puffit can hold a little less than a gram, so this isn't for large parties, probably only good for 2-3 people max. You need to stir the goods inside after two or three uses to make sure of the goods are used because the sides of the chamber is what heats up your nugget. This is probably one of the big downfalls of this product, if you're trying to get wasted. I prefer a quick pick me up over a blunt any day, I don't like getting smashed, so this is perfect for when you take a hit off of a larger piece at home (I have the Hot Box vape), then taking the Puffit with you to sort of ride that high throughout the day. 

You must charge this device in order to use it. The charge can last for about 7-10 uses when fully charged. It takes about 2 hours to charge this, I just leave it charging over night then I'm good for the next day, so if you're used to charging your phone overnight, it's just as easy. 

Some more notes: The product comes with a soft carrying case, my only gripe about it is that on the case it says ""Discrete Vape"" which does the exact opposite of what the product is intended. Honestly you don't need to use the case at all, the Puffit Inhaler is sturdy enough to be pocketed and not damaged. Also the Inhaler has a disclaimer saying it is not for medical use, though the font is very dark and you must hold it very closely to read this, so that does not give anything away (the inhaler is matte black and the font is black too).

**TL;DR** I'd recommend this to anyone that's looking for a way to be able to have a personal puff anywhere you would like, comfortably. It can be used anywhere in public as long as you're casual about it, which is exactly what the product is intended for.

As you all know, vaping is a significantly healthier way to get medicated than smoking. 

However, even the best of vaporizers have minor negative consequences on your lung health. There will always be microscopic particles that will get into your lung. Even though many of you will have healthy alveoli in lungs that will macrophage the particles and rid of them, some of us will be more prone to irritation.

I highly recommend putting a sort of ""screen"" between your mouth and the vaporizer (usually a plain, cotton cloth does the trick). You'll notice that improves the smoothness of the hit and you'll find some particles in the cloth that you're using to filter.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_1j1e22,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1j1e22/a_suggestion_for_anyone_who_is_not_using_a/,

Even though this article is 2 years old I haven't seen the beneficial effects of Omega 3 on tolerance levels mentioned here (or any other subreddit for that matter).  After about month of Omega 3 use I've noticed a significant reduction in the amount of cannabis I need to consume for a positive effect.  This effect kind of sneaked up on me, I guess I had been slowly using less and less over the past few weeks and only noticed when my buddy came over and we shared the vaporizer and I ended up getting way too high using the same amount we normally use together.  I hope this anecdotal evidence convinces some of you to try out Omega 3 not just for your cardiovascular health but also to help improve your CB1 receptors and help you to get the most out of your cannabis.

My AVB is a pretty dark brown, sorta like [this](http://img856.imageshack.us/img856/708/img20110728112919.jpg) (not my pic) but ~~maybe~~ (ninjaedit: definitely) even darker. There's no actually black/charred bits but overall it's really dark.

Anyway, I tried a gram, then 2, and got nothing from either attempt. Edibles have been hit or miss in the past for me so I made a 2g avb firecracker and gave it to my gf who usually would be blasted from a .5g regular edible and she said she never felt anything either so I don't think it's just me.

After that I figured if people are getting results from eating a gram or two straight I could probably do something like that so I decided to just try to 'go big or go home' I guess to make up for my dark brown and dumped 6-7gs into a milkshake and downed it and honestly never felt a thing all day. All these attempts I feel like I did everything right, eating a light fatty snack ~45min beforehand etc., the only thing I've come across recently that I hadn't been doing is powdering the AVB, which I see is pretty popular for capsules, but would that help edibles at all? I'd always heard that unless you burn it there should always be something left, but could I really need more than a 1/4 oz?

The last week or two I've been dumping my bowls when they start to get into light-medium brown territory, sometimes even still a little green here and there, so that I'll hopefully have better luck in the future, but I've got over an ounce of this dark brown AVB and would really appreciate any tips to get something out of it. Ideally something that doesn't require cooking, as I only have access to an oven very rarely, but if it's really necesary it can be arranged.

Edit: Got some great tips, I have a lot to try now, thanks guys! If anyone's got more though keep em comin lol..",,False,self,t5_2upjd,1361483346.0,,penguin,True,t3_18yvbl,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/18yvbl/can_avb_be_too_vaped_to_eat/,

For those of you who haven't it is basically just simmering your stems in milk on the stove and it makes an extremely potent cup of milk with similar effects of hash edibles.

I thought this sounded like a great idea so I decided to make an exact recipe for those of you who have dirty stems and want a potent cup of hot chocolate.

What you need:
First you need a dirty stem. As for the amount of resin, I wait until I have a thick layer of the golden brown goo about halfway up the stem. (Takes about 2-3weeks to accumulate, vaping every day)
You need a stove and a small pot.
A strainer and a spoon.
A coffee mug full (about 2 cups) of full fat milk or I use half 2% milk and half cream. The more fat content the better here!
And finally some hot chocolate mix.

The recipe:
Okay so first what I do is measure out my milk in a coffee mug so I know exactly how much I need for my cup of hot chocolate. Remember that some is going to evaporate so pour in a little extra.

Next your going to pour the milk into the pot/sauce pan and get it to a light simmer. After it is simmering throw your stem(s) in the pot and start stirring. Never stop stirring because milk can burn super easily. Do this for about 5 minutes or until all the oil is gone from your stem and floating in the milk. Take out the stem and stir until the oil is evenly mixed into the milk, this should take about 30 seconds, then take it off the burner. Next just strain the milk into your coffee mug and mix with hot chocolate mix and enjoy! This will definitely be the most amazing cup of hot chocolate you have ever tried

Also if your not a fan of hot chocolate you can try something else here, like mixing it with chai tea or something. The taste isn't strong so you can pretty much do it with anything you can mix with milk.
Be careful with this recipe ents!! It is extremely potent!!! If you don't have a high tolerance split it with a friend or don't wait for the stem to get super resinated.

I smoke around 6-10 solo stems per day so this was a perfect edible for me. It kept me at a [7] for 5 hours. And it also tastes great!!

Hello to all my fellow Ents.

I recently decided to try a new form of enjoying our favorite past time and bought myself a Puffit personal vaporizer. My main reason for buying this specific vape was discretion. Many people reading this probably disagree with this purchase, as the Puffit has recieved mixed reviews.

My initial reaction was one of curiosity. It felt like nothing was being ""smoked,"" what with the lack of visible smoke clouds, but I was still getting the desired effects. However, not long after the first session, I was getting less and less high and was quite upset, thinking I had bought a $150 paperweight. 

That's when I started doing some research. And, after following a few simple steps, I was able to get the device working incredibly, producing just visible vapor clouds and taking me to the moon.

So, to try and help other Puffit users who may feel like they've been cheated out of $150, I've compiled a list of very simple steps to maximize the performance of your Puffit.

1. Clean your Puffit. 
This is essential, as a lack of proper upkeep will cause build up and prevent your Puffit from performing properly.          

Follow the instructions in this video to properly clean your device.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4bLamOBvsk&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player

Note: I only followed the first cleaning directions and got great results later that night.                                             

2. Use the spring enhancement attachment.
That is important to keep your herb compacted nicely and to help heat it up

3. Grind your tree FINE. 
And I mean FINE. Leave your herb in the grinders longer for better results when vaping. 

4. Use dry herb. 
While everyone loves sticky tree, this does not work with the Puffit. The dryer, the better.          
                                
5. Heat up the Puffit before loading it.
Go through the process of blinking red-green-orange-red lights five time before loading the chamber. The Puffit will already be heated up and won't waste herb by getting to the proper temperature. 

6. Vape at a heat setting of 6.5.
This was the best for me.
                                            
7. After heating it up first, load the chamber all the way with your herb. 
Then, using the poker tool that comes with the kit, tamp the tree down until it's tight and taking up about 2/3 of the chamber.

8. Pull SLOWLY. 
10 seconds draws at least. Then, hold the vapor in your lungs longer then you would if you were ripping from a bong/bowl/blunt.

9. Clean the screen in the chamber after every session. 
This ensures that the next time you go, nothing is blocking the passageway.

And that's it. I followed these steps just last night and I definitely went to the moon. And this was only after 5-6 hits.

If you're having issues, try these steps before writing this device off. It may make you change your mind.

P.S. The vapor that I got is very imperceptible to the naked eye, which is, to me, very ideal. The best way to see how much vapor you exhale, hold up a cellphone flashlight close to your mouth when you exhale, and voila; clouds of vapor.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_1eg4xv,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1eg4xv/puffit_tips_for_disgruntled_consumers_xpost_rtrees/,

1368493636.0,27,self.vaporents,1ea8ls,A question for you guys... can you describe to me the difference you feel between a head high (from sativa being vaped) and a body high (from smoking blunts of indica),Chridsdude,31,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1ea8ls/a_question_for_you_guys_can_you_describe_to_me/,"So I've only ever smoked blunts and a few times pipes... and I always had a way better high using a pipe. The only bud I can find is usually indica heavy. Have any of you gone from smoking blunts allday errday of mostly indica to trying a vape of sativa bud? Can you describe it?

I'm asking because since I've started smoking I always yearned for a head high where I could listen to music and appreciate it and basically have a good creative type high to draw or write or something... but all I ever get is body highs where my body is weird feeling and I feel uncomfortable walking around. Then I just get lazy and couch-lock activates for a while...

When I get my own apartment I will get a vape for sure... but for now I can't get one. Can you describe to me in detail what it was like your first time? What's it often like when you get high? I'm very curious and excited because in a few years I'll have the privilege of experiencing what I've always wanted to get from weed!!... because after a while it's just not really that fun anymore to have body highs all the time.

EDIT: Thanks you guys... I guess I'm just gonna stick to using pipes because they've always given me a clearer high and I don't even get any anxiety... later on I'll see if I get some 80% sativa or some shit from silk road, maybe I'll move to california and get a medical license!

I used 150ml of a VG/PG mix for an oz of bud and it was too weak, but it definitely gets you there. I'd say halve it down to 75ml per oz of bud and you'll be good to go. 

You need the following: (I bought all my stuff on Amazon, you can too)

1. Small slow cooker
2. Cheesecloth
3. Vegetable Glycerin
4. Propylene Glycol
5. Everclear or very very high proof alcohol (I don't think 151 will do it because we're going to cook off all the ethanol, we don't want other junk left over.)



Step 1. Decarb your bud. (this is cooking 101, put your bud on a sheet, set oven to 200, and cook it for 30 mins. it's a chemical thing, look up why you have to if you don't know already. Fair warning, this is a very smelly process)

Step 2. Grind up and toss your decarbed bud into the slow cooker. Add in enough everclear to cover and then some. If you have any abv, toss that in there too. Stems? Decarb with the bud, grind it up and toss in there as well. Set your slow cooker to ""Keep Warm"" and cook it for 48hrs, stirring every once in a while, adding more everclear as needed. We are making an ethanol tincture here. The reason I used ethanol (drinking alcohol) was that in my research, I read that the type of alcohol in VG or PG is not the proper solvent to dissolve THC and CBDs. The overall strength of the alcohol tincture is not important at this point since we'll be cooking off all the ethanol later. 

Intermediate step: I was reading someone's recipe for budder an he said that he froze inbetween heating cycles to let ice crystals break the cell walls. I may incorporate that technique into my next batch. 

Step 3. Using the cheesecloth over a bowl, pour the contents of the slow cooker into the cloth. Squeeze out as much as you can. It should be dark green or almost black. At least it was for me, since I added a ton of ABV. 

Step 4. Mix your PG and VG. You can go straight VG if you want or straight PG. I believe mixing the two at a 8:2 ratio (PG at 8, VG at 2) gives you better clouds than going straight VG. VG apparently doesn't cloud well but I could have that reversed. 

Step 5. Clean out your slow cooker. Combine the alcohol extraction and the VG/PG. Set slow cooker to high. The avg temp of a slow cooker at high is still under 200 degrees. Ethanol boils off at 180. Let the ethanol boil off for a while, it shouldn't take TOO long... the goal is to end up with only VG/PG. So if you pour out the contents and you have 100ml or more, you need to keep boiling off that ethanol until you only have VG/PG.

Optional step. If you haz hash, dissolve the hash in everclear and dump it in as well. This will yield you a very very very strong e-cig juice. 

Once the ethanol has boiled off you're done. Load it into any refillable cartomizer. If you've purchased a flavor pack, just mix it in with the 75mls of juice you got. 

*edit* a note about the strength. After adding in a few grams of hash, Five or six puffs gets me to a [6] or [7] easily. (Before adding the hash it took twice as many puffs to get me to a 5) One fill of your cartomizer and you're good for a few days. I guess if you don't mind puffing away a whole lot you could lighten up the mixture with more pg/vg.

I've posted it a few times in comments, but I feel it needs its own submission.

It's a variation on the techniques utilised by a certain BadKittySmiles, who has posted recipes on cannabis forums all over the net to great acclaim - most notably, Grasscity, in this [massive sticky thread](http://forum.grasscity.com/incredible-edible-herb/742831-badkats-cannapharm-canna-caps-uv-reactive-glowing-hash-candy-canna-bombs-more.html).  If you're interested in the whys and wherefores, BKS explains reasons for doing things the way she does.

Anyway, here's my variation on the theme, tailored for ABV, as it needs no decarboxylation.  And I've reduced the potency dramatically, as BKS's recipes are designed with high-tolerance medical users in mind, and tend to be extremely strong.  

- I first grind my ABV in an electric grinder to reduce it to a floury powder, to make it easier on the digestive system.

- Then I heat a suitable amount of [coconut oil](http://www.chemistwarehouse.com.au/images/productimages/66265/original_CW.jpg) (roughly enough to cover the ABV) in a small pot or other receptacle.  Sometimes I'll just use the coconut oil jar (heating it slowly and carefully), since it's narrow, making for deeper oil (better when using a thermometer).  But something more heat-resistant would be better, of course - I just haven't bothered to find anything suitable so far.

- Then I add 10-15% [soy lecithin](http://i.imgur.com/sRPiz.jpg), plus the ABV (you can then add more oil if necessary if it isn't covered).  According to BKS, saturated fat is best, and coconut oil is very high in this.  And the lecithin is a natural emulsifier which significantly boosts the bioavailability of the cannabinoids (ie it makes your oil stronger).

- I then cook the oil/lecithin/abv mix for about 1/2 an hour at 120C/250F (which might longer than necessary), using an [oil/candy thermometer](http://i.imgur.com/r0Ozx.jpg) (&lt;$10).  At this temperature, at least I won't actually be *losing* any cannabinoids.  However, a double-boiler is another option, but water + oil all in the one pot (as per popular cannabutter recipes) won't work, as lecithin is soluble in *both* liquids.

- Then I add this oil to whatever food I like, or just eat it straight.  I find it's best to do so some time (say, 1/2 an hour) *after* a snack or small meal, rather than on an empty stomach, to avoid the [First Pass Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_pass_effect).

I generally find that less than a gram of ABV's worth of this cannaoil (usually about 1-2 tsp) is quite enough to get me where I want to be.  And when I haven't had it for a while, less than half a gram's worth may do.  Though I don't tend to vape at a particularly high temperature - my ABV still has flecks of green in it.  

The oil is also excellent in combination with vaping, as it produces a truly full-spectrum high, with both low- and high-temperature-boiling [cannabinoids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid).

And it was fully packed and charged, just waiting to be used. She has anxiety and a lot of stress so instead of stealing it back (I found where she hid it within 30 seconds of starting to look), I wrote out instructions on how to use it and what it's affects are. The last instruction is to get me, because I don't want her trying it for her first time by herself. She has been anti-cannabis her entire life, but I use it a decent amount and she knows of this. Our relationship is pretty good despite her judging me for using an illegal substance. I can't wait to see whether she gets mad, or hopefully wants to try it to help her with her cope with her stress.

In case you guys are wondering, it's a puffit and I told her previously that vaporizers are one of the healthiest and safest ways to try it.

The other day I was crunching some numbers and I discovered something quite interesting. 

I get stoned on my arizer solo usually once a week. If I buy a 10 (£10 worth of weed) it will last me about 6 weeks (As you use so little in each bowl, can make avb pills after, can use stems and extract the oil build up on the whip) so on average I spend £87 on weed a year. Over the 3 year warranty of the arizer solo this is a total of £261. Then add on the price of the solo (£150) and we have a total of £411 for 3 years of getting high. 

If I was to smoke it however the numbers are very different. My friends who smoke go through a 10 in 1 night so therefore costing them £10 a night (we will assume they smoke as often as me i.e. once a week), £520 a year and £1560 over 3 years. 

In total then by buying an arizer solo I will be saving myself over £1000 (£1149 to be exact (that's over £1 every day)).

Then there is the cherry on the cake. Not only are you saving so much money but the high is more enjoyable and not sleepy, it is more practical, it is stealthier, it is healthier, you are not using tabacco, you are not inhaling carcinogens and we didn't even factor in the costs of all the lighters/rizla/tobacco. 

But yet there are still people who tell me I'm an idiot of spending £150 on a vape. ",,False,self,t5_2upjd,1376378383.0,,,True,t3_1k8q9z,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1k8q9z/the_benefits_of_getting_a_vape/,

I randomly stumbled onto a 14mm Adapter for the PAX on ebay for $30  
So i said what the hell and gave it a shot.  
I also bought the Hydro Tube thats made for the Pinnacle Vaporizer since its a 14mm size.  

 The adapter is glass and is covered by a thick tube that fits perfectly snug over the PAX mouthpiece.  
Will give it a shot tonight and let you know how it goes.

EDIT2:  So I was gonna post last night but i got completely blown away and ended up falling asleep (I am a light weight tho)  
But from what i could remember, this thing is awesome!  With this setup it solves a few problems I disliked about the PAX.  
1)  Some people complained about when taking a draw from the PAX it feels restrictive and have a hard time taking a hit thatll fill up your lungs.  However when using this HydroTube Attachment you wont have that problem.... The hits are very easy to inhale with no sense of restriction.  
2)  Sometimes when using the PAX about 5-10Mins in the unit gets pretty hot and the vapor you inhale gets hot and burns your lips.  When using the hydro tube all the hits and extremely cool and it feels like you can inhale more.  
I recommend for best results you should inhale slowly from the hydro tube in a steady constant stream until your good.  You can lift up the hydro tube if you want to clear out the Tube but i dont feel its 100% necessary since its a small tube.

Obviously excluding the VapeXhale Cloud) but it get little to no press. I went into a local headshop and asked them which one they suggested and when I asked about the Arizer Extreme just to see what they said they responded with a bland ""It's not very good...""

I was floored and laughed and walked out of the store. This thing is 150-200 bucks cheaper then a lot of other vaporizers, comes with a laundry list of features that other vapes don't even have

* Remote
* Sturdier pieces
* Bag or Hose
* More control (Although this ties into the remote, the features on it are pretty cool including setting it to turn off after an hour of use)
* More discreet unit
* Bottom lit feature is cool but not practical
* Small easy pieces to clean
* Price
* Taste (Because the plant matter is raised away from the element and warm air is passed over it, the taste is a lot purer then say Da Buddha)

Ontop of all that the precise temp and ability to do bags and whip.

Compare that to (Not to pick a fight with a specific vape but to make a comparison) ""Da Buddha"" which has almost none of those features but is 40 dollars cheaper and is a much more inefficient vape that at the setting of ""ON"" just torches the entire bowl in a matter of 3 minutes tops which I guess would make it more comparable to a bong... But every vape is capable of this at the highest settings without question. Is the travel bag worth all that?

Once again, I'm not trying to pick a fight or be a fanboy but having used all table top vapes extensively, what is the argument for using a Volcano, Buddha, Silver Surfer, Underdog over this one, and why does it not get a lot of love from Vaporents compared to what I think of it?

I was done for the time being, so I put it on the ledge of the hot tub as I moved around the tub. It was still running and everything. As I go to turn on the jets, the water surged and ran over the top of the tub, right where my solo sat. It teetered, it tottered, and it fell.... into the hot tub. 

I watched the lights slowly sink to the bottom of the seat. I reached for it and grabbed it as quick as I could, but it had been fully submerged for a good few seconds already. As I pulled it out of the water, I jammed the buttons trying to turn it off ASAP, but it wouldn't turn off. It stayed on, until the lights beeped a funny pattern, and everything died out.

Fast forward to almost 36 hours later (to nowish). The solo has sat in the middle of a 50lbs bag of rice for 24 hours, then I let it sit above a baseboard heater for 8 hours or so. I tried to start it up and got nothing. I then replugged it into the wall and the lights came on!

I let it charge for a few hours and just tried it again. SUCCESS! The thing is working like normal (for now). I was expecting to have to buy a new one pronto, but alas, my luck is better than expected (for now!)

So for those looking for something that is sturdy as well as an awesome vape, I have to give it to the Arizer Solo. Awesome machine. I like it very much.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_132stq,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/132stq/had_a_major_accident_last_night_gotta_give_huge/,

I'm looking for some insight on the best ways to maximize my experience with this little work horse. I'll fire off some general questions but really anything you have for me would be great since I'm a fairly new vape user.

*How are you warming your unit up? Generally I'm warming the unit and cyclone bowl up to 220c/fan 3 for about 10 minutes ahead of everything else. If I'm doing a bag I'll drop the arm on there too. For a whip I pull the elbow at about 5  minutes, pack it and then let it sit without the fan on at all for a couple minutes at about 215 before I start.

*Elbow Packs or Cyclone Bowl? Tried both, EPs seem like they are either fantastic or meh, whereas CB packs are consistently in the middle. On that note...

*How do you pack up an EP or CB for max efficiency? What temps and fan settings are you running at? I'm at 215c for EPs and only use the whip, fan 1 for inhalation. CB I only ever use for bags, 212c/fan 3.

*Just in general how long am I supposed to hold hits? Information online is conflicting, some say only 10 seconds and yet others say you're being a dummy if you aren't ghosting it. 

*Also just a general vape question but what are you doing with you AVB? I've just straight up eaten it in a giant nutella and AVB sammich but I'm seriously considering making golden dragon really soon (like tomorrow so by Dec. 14th it'll be ready to go for the Hobbit premier!).

First, let me apologize if this has been asked already, but I couldn't find it from my searches. 

I am considering picking up another Vape. I've got the Extreme Q and MFLB but for whatever reason never have been a big fan of them. 

I've got the opportunity to pick up a Volcano Classic for $300, or I could go with something like the Pax or Solo. While the Pax and Solo have gotten great reviews from what I've seen, they always toss in the caviate ""They're great *for a portable*"".

How do units like the Pax and Solo compare to the Volcano in terms of vapor quality (strength, taste) and efficiency (tree conservation)?

For what it's worth, I would say that 95% of the time I smoke at home and by myself (well, that sounds a little depressing. My GF is there, she just doesn't partake).

I pack it so that my finger gets a little bit of resistance when I press it into the oven, but the oven is not packed so tightly that it is smushed, although you can with moderate success but it will not extend your sessions. I vape using low or medium heat (high ruins the AVB but can provide a more ""stoned"" feeling) and never even stir it. There are 3 main keys to using the Pax once you've figured out how much to put in it and what temperature you prefer.

1. Grind as fine as you can! I can't stress this enough... I have 2 grinders. I have a 70 dollar 4 piece crank grinder with a pollen catcher and I have a ""finishing"" 2 piece grinder by Aerospaced (12.99 at my local head shop) with only one chamber. The 2 piece finishing grinder is barely larger than a quarter and fits the PERFECT amount for the Pax oven. The Pax by Ploom is NOT satisfying at all without a good grind. They would do wonders by providing one at very little cost to them!

2. How to draw. When I describe how to hit my Pax to my friends, I tell them to imagine they are taking a big, slow hit from a cigar, drawing it first into their mouth, and then inhaling instead of puffing. Sometimes 2 draws are better than one; 3-4 seconds in between allows for a decent amount of vapor to build back up in the oven. This method not only produces awesome vapor clouds indoor or outdoor, makes the restrictive draw much, much less bothersome (mouth draws are stronger than straight lung draws, for sure,) but also prevents the mouthpiece from getting hot the way long draws do. I get roughly 20-30 pretty decent hits off of that small oven and it definitely does the job!

3. Immediately after use, empty ABV into whatever storage container you use, and set it upright with the mouth piece facing upward. Some people even recommend removing the mouthpiece completely as it does have an automatic shut off that is pretty efficient. I clean my Pax using a pipe cleaner about every 10 sessions and I also incorporate an alcohol wipe every third time I clean it (I don't mind as I usually do it with a good buzz while it's cooling, not hot, but still warm.) Make sure to get decent pipe cleaners and to defuzz them as much as possible with your index and thumb before using them on the inside of your Pax.

I hope this helps anybody who has a Pax and is having difficulty using it and I also hope this helps anyone looking to buy the Pax and who does not want that fun learning curve everyone talks about. The Pax by Ploom is the closest thing I've found to smoking a blunt; without the combustion of either the loose leaf or the tobacco leaf.

Side note; If your light is showing a temperature color (yellow, orange, red) it is not engaging the oven or maintaining temperature. It has to be blinking purple and then solid green. Try pushing the mouthpiece to one side or the other in order to create a better connection. My best guess is that it operates by completing a circuit.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,pax-blue,True,t3_196gzy,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/196gzy/how_to_pax_by_ploom/,

It takes 10-15 minutes for the full effects of the THC and other cannabinoids to take hold, so it's worth taking this into account, especially for your first hit of the day, when your tolerance is lower.  

If you keep toking and toking until you're where you want to be, you'll just keep getting higher and end up far higher than you were planning for.  But if you just have a small toke or two and then wait a quarter of an hour (I sometimes even set an alarm for it), you'll know where you're at, and you can then have more it you feel like it.  

But you're quite likely to find yourself most comfortable and in no need of another hit straight away, as it can take a surprisingly small amount for the first hit of the day.

We just finished our second eighth in our last sesh.  I figured since that was pretty constant use, I'd throw my thoughts about it into a post so it could help others decide if they want one or not.

In terms of a conversation piece, the Pax is great.  Every time I used it with a new person, they were fascinated by it and kept asking questions.  I've cleaned it only twice since I got it, and that's been totally fine.  I haven't noticed any mouthpiece ""sticking"" that others have talked about.  To clean it, I just submerged the mouthpiece and screen in isopropyl alcohol, swabbed out the oven with a cotton swab with iso on it, and ran some pipe cleaners with iso on it through it.  Not too bad.

Others have said that you need to pack it tight to get the best effect, but that hasn't really been true in my experience.  It gives you harder hits, but it's not like you're going to struggle to get vapor if you only have the oven half full of herb.  It's been pretty potent in both cases, if you ask me.

The battery life is great for me.  I've gotten 2 sessions out of it while the light's been on red.  Charge it up for 45 minutes to an hour after that, and you've probably got another 4 or 5 sessions.

I noticed that my best hits were taken when I used an extremely slow and light draw, each draw being like 5-15 seconds, depending on how hard of a hit you want. 

The only weird thing I've seen so far is that sometimes while the oven's heating, the Pax will once in a while randomly show the temperature setting.  It's like the machine temporarily forgot that the mouthpiece was in and wasn't removed.  Anybody else had this issue?

Sorry my thoughts have been so rambling and disjointed, I'm pretty high.  If you have any specific questions about the Pax, I'd be happy to try and answer them.

however, after i read a bit more about it on FC, i decided to buy my own to use to get into concerts and such with a vape. i *thought* it would be crappy vapour and a mild high, but a nice look that was worth it.

and at first, it was.

however, the company that produces the puffit released what they call the ""vape enhancer thingy"" (that's really what it's sold as on their website). it's basically a stainless steel spring that fits into the cap of the unit and pushes down the herb, keeping it packed, even as the herb begins to shrink as it dries out. this doesn't sound like it would make a big deal, but it does. i received mine today, tested it out, and holy shit. i was deffidentally medicated. i finished the whole bowl, which still vaped evenly through much quicker and got more ""kick"" out of the herb.

it's sold on their website for $0.99 and comes standard with all new units bought from them ($140ish).

Just wanted to spread some news from earlier today.

Long story short, Vapexhale got screwed over by their manufacturer. They were caught selling blueprints to competitors and not measuring up to their quality standards. So they dropped the manufacturer. 

Their problem is now they have no manufacturer, they are still a very young new company -- working hard to stay being an awesome top of the line vaporizer producer. 

Now here's the thing, they've experienced some financial setbacks, and have even gone as far as taking loans out against their homes to finance their business. They are in need of support, and if you are willing to support them now, they have a killer deal on a very badass top of the line vape.

They just announced the [Vapexhale Nimbus](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/976154_10151598684453926_1837780482_o.jpg). And they want to get a kickstarter going for it --- leaving us a pretty cool opportunity. To get a Vapexhale Cloud, it would cost about $650-700 for the full setup with a Hydratube and all. But you can get the new Vapexhale Nimbus w/ a Hydratube for $500. Or you can donate $1,000 and get even more, see below.

Stonemonkey55, founder of Vapexhale, posting on FuckCombustion earlier today:

""We are in the process of raising some additional capital so that we can really push forward with our new designs. In order for VapeXhale to ramp up as quickly as possible, we'd like to put some additional infrastructure in place so that we can function (for lack of a better word) like a ""big boy"" company. We have two ""Perk"" levels currently:

$500 - Gets you a Nimbus + HydraTube + Limited Edition Nimbus T-shirt

$1000 - Gets you Limited Edition Nimbus, Limited Edition HydraTube, Limited Edition Nimbus T-Shirt, Lifetime warranty, and Beta Testing access.

We do not have a very large goal as we have taken out loans ourselves but this additional funding will be very, very helpful for us to function optimally. If you cannot contribute you can still help us by sharing the link below. Thanks so much for the support and we are looking forward to the next phase of this company where we can all work on this full time and execute the way we know we can.

I put about 15 grams of material in it, and let cook for a few hours. Last week, I decided to get it out of the fridge and use it to make some firecrackers.

I mixed the budder with some organic peanut butter. The mix was a bit to runny to put on gram crackers, so I decided to dump my avb into the mix (about 30 grams). Mixed in some cocoa powder and brown sugar to thicken it up more and got it sweet and thick enough to spread on the crackers.

I have more than enough spread and wind up using the entire box of gram crackers. 

I wrap them up in foil and stick them in the oven for 25 minutes at 320 degrees

I've never used AVB and budder before and wasn't sure how strong these were going to be.

I ate two quarters of the cracker and I'm at an 6 after an hour, two hours later and I'm at an 8.

I fall asleep and wake up the next morning still at a 4.

Next time I'll put together a real recipe and post it for you guys.

I found it originally at /r/ABV
Here's my take on the recipe with some slight modifications and detailed instructions.

1. Grind up your ABV in a coffee grinder to powder, the finer the better.
1. Place ABV powder in small ceramic container such as a mini crock (like those used in french onion soup).  Any small pyrex or ceramic container should work, such as a coffee mug.
1. Add coconut oil (heat it up to be liquid), pour over the ABV until it's just barely submerged, do not add this all at once, add a little then stir, add a little more until it's no longer a batter but runs freely.
1. Add soy lecithin granules, about 10% the amount of coconut oil you used.
1. Place pyrex or ceramic container in an empty crock pot on high.
1. Cover the crock pot and heat for 1 hour
1. Stir once then reduce heat on crock pot to low for another 5 hours stir a few times during this process to prevent hot spots.
1. **CONTAINER WILL BE HOT!** Carefully remove the ceramic or pyrex continer with a pot holder and transfer to a shallow dish for easy access
1. Using a spoon or needleless syringe fill gel capsules, I recommend putting down paper towels or news paper for this as it can be messy
1. Wipe down the completed capsules to remove excess oil

Notes: The finer you grind the ABV the easier it will be fill your capsules.  I suggest emptying the grinder, stirring and grinding a second time to get any of the larger pieces down to a fine powder, think flour consistency.  There is no need to strain out the ABV from the oil unless you're going to cook with it.  If you do plan to cook with it instead of filling capsules go with a courser grind so it's easier to strain in a fine wire mesh strainer.

NOW foods carries organic non-GMO soy lecithin, I ordered mine on amazon but I'd imagine healthfood and ""whole"" food stores may also carry it.  My first few batches were made with Soy Lecithin gelatin caps but these were pre-mixed with glycerin.  I'm unsure if the glycerin prevents the lecithin from properly emulsifying the oil or not.  I know that it's used instead of PG in ecigarette liquids which is an emulsifier and surfractant / humectant.  I'm sure it didn't hurt but my first few batches were not as strong as my more recent ones using dry lecithin granules",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,extremeq,True,t3_1acabp,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1acabp/abv_coconut_oil_with_lecithin_my_tweaks_on_bit/,

(already vaped bud kief)?,wirewolf,26,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1a0spt/avbk_already_vaped_bud_kief/,"**Edit**: I think I figured it out. I had this low grade hash while back that I tried to vape with MFLB, but it didn't really work very well and the hash turned into powder that I probably put in the jar and that's what I got out by shaking it, along with some small bits of the avb. My new vape probably did a better job vaporizing it and that's why it worked so well. Experiment canceled! nothing to see here =)

I had a bit of AVB in a glass jar (maybe 5 grams) and I was thinking about what to do with it. I know you can eat AVB (and smoke if you like). I was just thinking if I could come up with something else I can do with it. 

I noticed that my grinder almost perfecly fit the glass jar, so I took the screen and bottom parts off of my grinder and put it on the jar. Then I shock the jar like a pepper shaker. 

What I got out of it was a ton of this brown kief looking stuff. I wasn't sure if it was worth anything so I put a tiny bit into my vape and tried it. Seems to work really well [7]. Has anyone else tried this?

(And why you should too?),CallMe_Jack,36,14,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1irh6a/heres_why_i_still_love_my_magic_flight_and_why/,"I'm relatively new to r/vaporents, and I see a lot of comments both for and against the magic flight. In my life, I'm one of a handful of people I know that owns it, and most of the others have moved well past the MFLB in their relationship with MJ, as have I. I came to be a vaporent for health concerns as a distance runner, and when I got the MFLB I smoked namely in a social, group setting. I wasn't happy with that at all, and moved up to a VaporBros, which is similar to a DBV or SSV. SO, this bad boy was and still frickin is the boss. My/my peers' intake of MJ went up with our age and I went from picking up smaller amounts to larger, namely to save money in the long run.


And here's where most of my other friends misjudged the MFLB. With all this dank around, our tolerances shot thru the roof. The MFLB went from a neat intake method to a disappointing time-out from the VaporBros.


Most of my friends discarded the box as it 'doesn't work anymore', selling or stowing the MFLB. My personal experience is different however. I've held on to mine, and while it might be seldom used during times of higher overall intake (see: ""summer""), it's the perfect piece for a lot of situations, namely:

 

* Getting high*ER*. When I'm churning thru green, it's usually not with a vape, and the contrast is often enough to get me exactly where I'm trying to be.
 


* Personal use. If I've had at least a day **or** heavy exercise (pretty common for me personally) since my last sesh, I can't deny that one or two trenches will get me *lifted*. Maybe not *high*, but a comfortable [4] to [6], depending on where the endorphins are at.

 

* VACATION! I'm on it now, and that's why I feel prompted to write this love note to my MFLB. Him and a tic-tac container full of green is all I, in what I'd consider a heavy use phase of my life, have for two weeks. And I'm okay with that! So long as I can take days off, **consistent use of only the magic flight brings my tolerance levels down to meet it**. It's ridiculously efficient as well, plus gel caps give me easy access to a different type of high thru instant edibles from ABV.
 


* Lastly, and most importantly: when your life changes. Heavy ganja intake is a phase in most people's lives. I love it now, but in the future I know there will come a time where I need to treat MJ like I choose to drink now- semi-occasionally, and sometimes not at all depending on outside factors.
 


Thanks for reading thru all this rant. [I saw a post that was similar to this but with an opposite thesis](http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1h0yo5/does_anyone_else_strongly_dislike_using_the_mflb/) a while back, and wanted to post this as a semi-response and get my thoughts out on my favorite piece.

Here are my reviews


**Vapor Central.** headed up to yonge st to check out what all the hype was about. 5 bucks gets you through the door. this includes bag rental for dozens of volcano vaporizers. they are all in good condition. it was an enjoyable experience well worth the price. 12 bucks gets you the best glass they have to offer filled with ice cold water and immaculately cleaned. staff were helpful, informative and friendly. all of them. entertainment was provided, good movies, music, shows etc. only thing is it does get a bit smokey inside which for me i actually enjoyed. i left there super baked and completely satisfied. *two thumbs up.*

**Hotbox cafe**. went down to kensington market to check out one of their open mike/ comedy jams. the price was right. 5 bucks included the show and vape bag rentals. comedy was mediocre but got exponentially better the more i smoked. now thinking about it they had some pretty talented comics working that room. the vaporizer isn't as good imho as a volcano but it was fun and it did the trick. their bongs aren't as classy but they loan them out for free which is nice. down side is the small cramped space. the sketchiness of the clientele and surrounding area (we knew we were close when i started hearing people yell ""KUSH. I GOT KUSH.)Unfortunately I really don't see this place sticking around for very long because of the dealing issue as well as people smoking cigarettes inside. it is not without its charm though. not for me but definitely check it out if your brave and into trying something new. *one thumb up*


**vape on the lake**. ripoff central. 5 dollars at the door. 5 dollar vape bag rental. super expensive bong rentals. and unfortunately if you wanna go out get some fresh air or sun for more than 5 minutes they make you re-rent the bong and vape bag. staff is lazy/ unhelpful, we are all stoned but just help a brother out. man i always try to be a ggg i don't hassle anyone but honestly bad vibe from the staff at this place and i won't be going back anytime soon i completely regret taking the 1 hour plus subway ride to this sad excuse for a vape lounge. *no thumbs up*


**Village Vapor Lounge**- Walking distance to vapor central in the heart of wellsley village is village vapor lounge. The staff is friendly the location is clean. This place wasn't too sketchy and seemed to have taken the right measures to keep this place secure. they are strict on no tobacco/ no blunts which i like. Entrance fee is 5 bucks and that covers the full day. bong rentals are reasonable going from 5 to 12 dollars, with some clean respectable glass to choose from. I saw four vaporizers there all volcano digit and a modest 3 dollars for your own bag. one drawback is they don't sell too many things there can't even buy a bottle of water but the staff are nice enough to pour you a glass of water so I really couldn't complain too much. it is nice though to be able to buy a pipe/ bong/ beeline/ papers right on location like in kensington market/ vapor central. i really enjoyed this place and can't wait to check out one of their popular live comedy shows one day.*one and a half thumbs up*.

Nowadays there is a great selection of vapes and new designs are getting churned out left and right.  Its great to see a portable market expanding, and the desktop vapes getting more cutting edge.  You would think after all this advancement a 10+ year old design such as the Volcano would be updated or be inferior.   Now it really is a well built machine, but to see so many redditors argue their Volcano is the best vaporizer is infantile.

  I'm not here to give my opinion on the machine but to help others understand what makes it so damn respected.  For one it has an awesome name, and appearance and for any product those are huge selling points.  It's become synonymous with vaporizing and the shear popularity it has actually introduces many to vaporizing.  Price, that huge sticker shock price it has *must* mean its worth it; high price = high quality and value in most everyone's past experiences.  If someone pays that much for anything recreational they go all salesman-like when they talk about it, justifying the purchase to themself.  

I gotta hand it to Storz &amp; Bickel they are genius business owners.  In some business situations it is better to keep the price high.  This sub has become seriously knowledgeable but anytime the Volcano is mentioned this place reverts back to revering it as the king of vaporizers.  I'm not sure whether there are Storz &amp; Bickel employees here adding these reviews or if these are actual owners.  I partially wanted to warn seriously interested buyers of this product to do more research and look at other designs.  Up until a year ago I *knew* the Volcano was the best, turns out I just hadn't looked at any other vape.

**TL;DR**  Its an impressive product but not for the right reasons imho, so that was why I decided to write this up.

I have been seeing multiple people each day come to this sub and ask the same questions, so I'm gonna try to clear some stuff up for you. Vaporizers save herb and are much more healthy than smoking. However, vaporizers can be intimidating. I'm going to attempt to make clear the differences between each one.

**Q: Dude, how blasted will a vape get me?**

*A*: It all depends on which vaporizer you get, most will get you just as high/much higher than smoking. I personally feel like smoking highs are more 'foggy' and 'dirty' or 'hazy', where vape highs are clear and bright and vivid.

**Q: I don't feel high when I'm vaping. THIS SHIT SUCKS**

A: It is very likely that you are not inhaling properly or you do not have the temperature set right. Also, different CBD's vaporize at different temperatures, so you may have to turn the temp up until you feel that 'stoney' feeling, if that's the kind of high you like. 

**Q: My local headshop sells a cheap knock off of X vape for $50. Should I get it?!**

A: No. Just save your money and buy a real vape like the Silver Surfer. I personally wouldn't even mess around with the box vapes. The vapes like the Easy Vape actually have a plastic outside that get warped and melted from the heat which is very poor design if you ask me.

**Q: BUT IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE!!**

A: Yeah, vapes are pretty expensive nowadays unfortunately. However, you get what you pay for. The best things come to those who wait.** 

**Q: What the hell is AVB/ABV?**

A: AVB means ""Already Vaped Bud"" and ""ABV"" means ""Already been vaped"". They mean the same thing, but the second one makes a little less sense to me. Oh well. AVB is the weed that has been used in a vape. When the bowl has gone from green to a light/medium/dark brown, people usually dump it in a storage container to eat or cook with later.

**Q: I can cook that shit?**

A: Yes. You can use it to make edibles. You can also just throw it on top of some yogurt or something and eat it that way. It will still get you high since the THC has already been heated and therefore activated. Take note that you are of course eating the bud that most of the THC has been vaped off of already so it might take you a gram or two of AVB to feel anything.


**Q: Okay, so what is the best vape?**

*A*: Most people will immediately tell you that the Volcano is the best vape hands-down. 

I disagree. The only reason you should buy a Volcano is if you really want a bag vape. The volcano is built like a tank and will always work and give you consistent vapor. I, however, am not a big fan of bags. There are also people who will say that the 'VapeXhale Cloud' is the future of vaping but I personally disagree. Look at any youtube review of it. It's chunky, doesn't work too well, and is just a meh vaporizer with an incredibly high price tag.

**Q: So what do I get if I'm not really interested in a bag vape?**

*A:* A Silver Surfer, or Da Buddha. They are pretty much perfect whip vapes. They very very rarely have issues, they too are built like tanks, and they deliver strong, powerful, delicious, knock-you-on-your ass vapors every single time. I prefer the Silver Surfer but the Da Buddha is good for people on a budget, since it is essentially the same thing. If you get a bong to filter the vapor through from either of these, you have just about the purest, most amazing cannabis experience ever. Simply incredible.

**Q: What about the Magic Flight Launch Box (MFLB)? Isn't that the best vape ever?!?**

A: I have had two Magic Flight Launch Boxes and I do not like them. They get the job done, but they don't get it done all that well. They do not pack much of a punch, and are absolute toys compared to a desktop vape like the Silver Surfer. The MFLB is pretty much made to break, and the 'lifetime warranty' is evidence of that. The MFLB is made with cheap materials and is very picky about how it vaporizes, and combusts very easily.

If you are on the go all of the and really like how it looks and don't plan to vape much, then go for it. With enough patience you'll learn to use it. It is probably one of the least user-friendly devices I have ever used, and despite everyone saying their customer service is amazing, I have had nothing but poor experiences with them. the CS rep took weeks to get back to me and was kind of snobbish to me too.

**Q: Okay, so I'm not too set on the MFLB anymore, but I still need a portable vape for stealth reasons. Help!**

A: The PAX is a good vape but uses up lots of material fast, and is not really the strongest vape. It is the Apple product of the vape world- sleek and stylish, but not all that amazing. The Da Vinci vape is very nice. It looks like a walkie-talkie and provides awesome vapor. It's probably what I'd recommend. HOWEVER, Da Vinci is coming out with a new vape called the Descent very soon. I would wait until reviews are out, but it looks promising.

The Arizer Solo is also a very solid vaporizer but it is bigger and not too stealthy.

**Q: But this guy on /r/trees told me the Extreme Q was the best vape ever because it does BAGS and a whip!!!**

A: The Extreme Q is a great vape but it is very fragile. The 'metal' outside part is actually not real and feels very cheap. The bags are kind of 'cheesy' and do not work well, and most people just end up using the whip on the Extreme Q.

I like the device a lot. I need about 4 hits (lasting ~10 seconds each) to get myself REALLY baked. 


As curious as I am though, I wonder what other devices can 'achieve' with the same amount of herb. The DBV/SVV seem to be awesome products, but the thing that confuses me, is that a lot of people talk about the thick clouds. 


Then there are also comments that are similar to what I will make up here: ""My MFLB only gets me to a [3] and the DBV/EQ can get me to an [8]"".


A quotation from the magic-flight site, before I write down my questions: ""Any vapor that is visible on exhale is wasted, therefore, by definition any device that produces visible vapor on exhale is categorically less efficient than one that does not. As such then, the ideal vapor density is exactly that which can be adsorbed by the lungs in a natural/comfortable interval of time -- usually between 3 to 5 seconds.""


So right now my interpretation is that ""thick clouds"" aren't better. Most likely they'll be much denser and there will be more vapor on exhale, which is 'wasted vape'. 


In all my confusion, I would like to get answers to these questions:


TL;DR:

- If I pack ~0.15g in a MFLB and the same amount in a DBV, how would they compare? Can a device like the DBV get me/someone (much) higher with the SAME amount of herbs? If yes, how so?

- Why are thick clouds more prefered? Vaping doesn't take much time (imo), so why are thick clouds prefered? I can vape a trench with my MFLB in under 10 minutes with 'normal clouds'.

- How can some users only get to a [3] with device X and to an [8] with device Y? When both devices get your load evenly cooked? Does this also mean that the [3] device will be left with more potent AVB than the [8] device? 

It just all seems so confusing :'(. I wish I knew someone with a desktop vape, but I do not, so I can't experience for myself... Until I decide to get a desktop myself. Which might be sooner than later ;).

I've been a casual smoker for years (usually once a day), and I've long had interest in getting a vaporizer in order to make my habit a bit healthier. I finally decided to buy a vape, and I settled on the Pax after looking at some reviews. It's expensive, but it seems like a high quality product, so what the hell?

Anyways, my Pax came in the mail this morning. It looks and feels awesome, can't wait to use it later. A few questions though:

- How fully should I pack the oven? I've read that you should pack it fairly tight, but if I load it 1/2 or 3/4 of the way, will that result in a much worse session? I don't usually smoke huge bowls, so I'll be a little bummed if I have to load it all the way every time. 

- How long should a session last, and what temperature settings do you recommend? I'm not quite sure how to know when the bowl is done with a vaporizer.

- I ordered from vapeworld and they sent me a cheap little plastic grinder as a gift. Is this grinder sufficient, or would I be better served by buying a nicer one? If so, any recommendations? What's the advantages of a 2 piece grinder vs. a 4 piece? 

- How should I go about my first session? I think I saw someone recommend turning it on and letting it sit for 5 minutes before smoking, but aren't you supposed to load the oven with the Pax off? 

- If I average one session a day, how often do you recommend cleaning it?

- What should I do with the leftover herb after vaporizing? I get that you can use it for edible purposes, and I would like to do that, but I have no experience with that either. Any good resources on what to do with it?

- Any other tips/tricks/recommendations?

I've been using a puffit since September, saving up my postvape to eat one day. I was going to visit a friend at his house, and decided to bring my vape poo and bake it into firecrackers. I live in a dorm and can't cook there.

I used [this](http://beyondchronic.com/2012/01/how-to-blast-off-nutella-firecrackers/) guide. The author ate 1/4 tsp worth of postvape and got to around a [5]. He used medical, so I figured I would double the amount; I have decent quality bud but nothing special. I couldn't really smell the baking process, AVB smells a lot less than fresh bud. I'd still be careful microwaving this in your dorm room.

My friend and I each ate one - they tasted like slightly weedy nutella, like how brownies have that weedy taste. We headed off to a party after waiting a bit. About an hour in, I could tell I was getting slightly baked. By the time we got to the party, I was really baked; I was having some trouble talking to people, and sat on a couch. It was a really heavy body high, the kind when you're really drowsy and moving makes you feel like you're lagging. After a while it was getting crazy, it felt like g-force was sticking me to the couch, moving felt extremely weird, and I couldn't keep track of anything happening. I went back to my friends house with him (he was feeling it but not as much as I was). We both passed out for about four hours, before I woke up and walked back home. I woke up the next day still vaguely stoned and with pink eyes.

Out of curiosity I emailed 7th Floor about the pockets being upside down in the bag. I figured they would give a ""Sorry, but its not covered under warranty"" response and was OK with that being the case. Just wanted to interact with them to see what they were like.

I ended up in a discussion with a rep named Chris who lied and backtracked 3 times before he stopped replying altogether. First he said I had a different version of the bag than they were selling on their website (I don't). Then he said that I had the same model of bag but an earlier version where the pockets were put in upside down. Then he said that the pockets being upside down was the newer version, and based on the pictures I had sent (I never sent any pictures at all so I've no idea what he is referring to) that's the version I had.

It was a truly bizarre customer service experience as there was absolutely no reason for him to backtrack repeatedly and make things up. All I was looking for was a ""Hey, sorry, that sucks but its not covered under warranty but if you have any problem with your vaporizer itself don't hesitate to call us.""

There seems to be questions about abv capsules and differing opinions on the effects. So I'm documenting my time on this journey for science. 

I used what I believe is a 00 sized capsule (its pretty big, kind of difficult to swallow). My abv was a medium-dark brown color vaped with a PAX. Now the amount of abv was not measured, I ground up the ABV into a fine powder with a mortar and pistol. Then I packed as much of the powder as I could into the capsule by using a small metal tool. I pretty much had an empty stomach right before taking it.

8:25pmEST: Ingested.

10:30pm: Its starting to kick in.

11:03pm: Starting to get a body feeling. [3] 

11:37pm: Eyes getting red. [3.5]

6:00am: Still having a very intense high and not feeling well. 

6:45am: Fell asleep not feeling well.

7:15am: Woke up again at a more comfortable [7] and the nausea went away. 

8:05am  Still pretty high [7]. Went back to sleep.

1:18PM: woke up still feeling slight residual effects [2].


I obviously must have packed to much powder into the capsule. I did not have too good of a time.

when i first got the original vaporblunt, i absolutely loved it. large enough bowl to get 3-4 people high, and thick creamy tokes on the hottest setting. i had *high* hopes for the second one and honestly, i'm impressed. it takes the stellar function of the original and squishes it down to nearly half the length.

the 2.0 has 5 heat settings as opposed to 2 settings on the original. it comes with an oil attachment ([picture](http://i.imgur.com/BVlit.jpg)) so anyone looking to vaporize oil, this is a pretty cool feature, but this is what the 2 highest heat settings are for. if you use the hottest or 2nd hottest settings for dry bud, you will burn it. i have yet to try it with oil but i will be within the next week. 

the tokes are ridiculous on this thing though. i usually put the temperature to the 3rd setting and start to toke it as the 2nd heat level is ready. you wont get tokes like that off your mflb. imo it holds its own against a volcano bag. i was coughing like crazy the first time i tried it. the bowl packs about .5g which is less than the original but i found packing it down really tight allows for a longer session. a bigger bowl would be my only improvement request.

the battery on it lasts a good 2 hours, but it is fresh so the decline in life wouldn't be apparent to me at this point. i have to say though i've had the original for &gt; 1 year and it still lasts just as long as when i first got it. 

it is a fairly solid unit, though there is more plastic on the shell than the original. i heard complaints of a plastic taste from the device, but i didn't notice anything like that. sterilizing your mouthpiece is essential though.. i noticed an odd plastic taste when using the flavoured tip which i did not sterilize, but only because i wasn't anticipating using it (not a fan of mint)

all in all it is a very good portable vape. i know it is a bit pricey, but i've tried the mflb, the iolite, and a pen vape and you truly get what you pay for. better vape by far.

TL;DR - 4.5/5 in the portables category.

Basically, I'm a frequent smoker, once a day atleast, and I'm stepping it up to a vape. What I look for is convenience, and comfort over all other things. Keep in mind that I am a first time vaper and I have absolutely no experience with one. Also, I live in a suite with 2 other guys, who don't smoke, but are fine with me smoking. They don't care if I do it in the suite, but I'd prefer not to be a dick, so I'd only do it if it doesn't smell.

So, here are a few questions I have.

What are some pros/cons of both devices?
Does pushing in the battery on the MFLB hurt your hand?
Does the PAX heat up to a point where it's uncomfortable to hold?
Does replacing screens / maintenance cost a lot on either device?
Which one produces better vapor?
Which one is easier to use?
Do either products cover physical damage in their warranty?
Which product smells more?
Can I burn the weed easily with the MFLB? (I mean burn, not heat.. to the temperature we don't want)
How hard is it to learn to use the MFLB? Such that I can hold the battery in for the correct time.
Is the 30 second wait for the PAX in between hits? or for the entire chamber?
Which one smells more?

Also, feel free to tell me about anything else that might help me with my decision :)
And please tell me if you've had any bad experiences with either companies!

I'm leaning towards the pax... because it looks REALLY nice, and it seems like the kind of device where I could spend 10 minutes just staring at it when I'm stoned.

My most notable experience was this weekend, when I took 2g (which I did not think was that much at the time &amp;mdash; *big* mistake) of ABV on an empty stomach at about 3:00 pm. I stayed up until about 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, drank some and vaped a couple bowls with friends, and thought I hadn't taken enough because the effects were very mild and seemed to be tapering off before I went to bed. Then, the next morning, at around 9:30 (more than 18 hours after I first ingested the ABV), I woke up so incredibly high that patterns were flashing before my eyes and everything felt completely foreign. I quickly convinced myself that I had spontaneously developed schizophrenia or some other mental illness, leading me into a panic attack that lasted about an hour. After talking with a friend and calming myself down, I eventually went back to bed and later woke up sober and pretty much fine with how the experience had gone. However, what confuses me is the apparent 18 hour gap between ingesting the ABV and the aforementioned experience. Most of the accounts I've read have indicated that it should only take a couple hours for edibles to take full effect and that the experience usually isn't that long, so I'm wondering what might have caused the lengthy time to take effect. I'm also wondering how to deal with the long kick-in time. I've thought about maybe taking the ABV before going to bed or taking it early in the morning, allowing me to wake up before the high seriously kicks in and let myself ease into it, but I feel like that would require a lot of pre-planning and doesn't leave a lot of room for error. Has anybody else had a similar experience and how do you deal with it?

I've been considering buying a vaporizer lately, and I'm having a blast reading up on all these wonderful devices. 

Now, I've never tried vaping, yet I somehow can't help but worry that it'd feel different, like some magic is being lost. Surely I can't be the only one who finds the *act* of smoking *in itself* soothing, regardless of content. Bongs are fine as well, so I think it's the combustion that does it for me. The health drawbacks are obvious, of course, but isn't the lighter, the flame, the sparkling and crackling of burning weed all part of what makes it such an endearing experience?

Also, when inhaling vapor through a tube or a device, doesn't that make it feel more like you are just.. administering some drug? And then you might say that, well, that pretty much is what you're doing anyway, so the rational choice is to do it in a way that causes less harm. And I generally agree, but isn't there some other dimension to smoking as well? Something that gets lost when it becomes too technological?

I might be completely unreasonable here, and I apologize if that's the case. But any input is greatly appreciated. How was *your* journey towards becoming a vaporent? Were you skeptical at first, like me, but learned to love it?

I have heard from a lot of people that the Volcano kicks every other vape's ass. What makes it so much better? I've seen people say that it is more efficient and produces more vapor, but is it worth spending the $540?

I have been using the MFLB for awhile but I wanted to expand my vape experience. I went with the PAX because most reviews I read on it said that it was the best new Vape on the market from both a technology and discretion standpoint. I can now say that without a doubt, in my experience, it definitely is.

For starters the thing is really beautiful, if you are into a minimalist and Apple-esque design aesthetic then this thing will blow you away. It is really great to hold (although a little slippery, because its metal), however when you have it in the palm of your hand it just feels cool. Like you are vapeing in a Ridley Scott sci-fi epic. I know some people prefer the MFLB's rustic charms, and thats fine, this is a mostly subjective situation. Although I do think that the PAX looks less like a smoking utility, and because of that I would say it wins the discretion section of the aesthetic test.

Operating it is a breeze, pop off the magnetic door at the bottom and pack in a load of herb. The chamber size is comparable to the MFLB as you can pack your product in tight, since you dont have to worry about the delicate screen like you do on the launch box. Once you are loaded just click the mouthpiece at the top out to activate the device. As a side note let me just say the whole mouthpiece pop out to turn it on, pop off to control the temperature, is just cool! It feels slick and futuristic and its fun, this might sound stupid but I really enjoy the way it works haha. Once you turn it on the device takes 30 seconds to warm up, this was my main sticking point with the PAX, I was worried that the 30 seconds would seem like an ENTernity compared to the MFLB. It does feel like a wait, thats true, however the fact is it is only at the start and 30 seconds is not really a big deal. Plus I find that using the MFLB continually can tire my hand out, holding in the battery, so for me it is a happy trade off to wait a few seconds at the start of my sesh and be able to just take a pull whenever I want.

Once its warm the thing works great, after only a few pulls I was feeling the effects and really enjoying the system. I must have spent 30 minutes just turning it over in my hands and playing with it at a [6]. I still haven't decided which heat setting I like it at best, on the lowest there is no smoke at all, but I don't think it is quiet as powerful. At the highest there is a bit of combustion/cloud, but it definitely hits harder and faster. I prefer the precise temperature controls of the PAX to the MFLB as I dont have to ""train"" people how to properly use the PAX and get the best draw, like I do with the MFLB. The end does get pretty warm, I would compare it to the bottom of a really hot MacBook (~40C), so it can be annoying, but once I felt the effects of my herb I honestly enjoyed how warm it was in my hands. However if you think thats too hot dont worry, it's not a big deal as it is only the lower third of the device, so you can hold it comfortably with the upper 2/3rds.

Battery life, when compared to the MFLB with the exchangeable battery there is no contest, the MFLB wins. However, I have used it for a good amount of time (2-3 sesh's), which consisted of about 3 loads worth, before the battery ran down. The big thing is that once you get going you can put it down and forget about it, it switches to low power mode and eventually turns off but I think that does burn some battery. It is better than the alternative of it just running itself into the ground, if you are into a really long sesh you could just bring out the charger and rest the PAX in it when it isn't in use, thus charging the battery. I have a feeling that the battery life will suit most vapers as they are not usually that far from electricity for *that* long. However, if you plan on taking long (see: 3+ hour) hikes in the woods with this thing packing multiple loads it will probably let you down.

Warranty is another thing that people have brought up, obviously the MFLB has a lifetime warranty which is great, but the PAX offers 10 years. I think that if they both work for a DECADE this is kind of a tie, I mean 10 years from now who knows what kind of cool new vapes or technology will exist? Getting a decade out of a product is fine for me, but if you think you are going to get 20+ years of use out of your MFLB and you need warranty to cover it for THAT long, then I guess the PAX isn't for you.

Cleaning is pretty easy, pop off the mouthpiece and soak a pipe cleaner in iso to clean out the tube. The screen in the bottom of mine popped off easily but was a bit of a challenge to pop back in. I was worried if I didn't have it on right I would mess something up, but after getting it as close as I thought it would go everything worked fine.

I really like the PAX and because it is so small, sleek, and cool. it's a device that real makes you want to smoke (not that you don't already haha). I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in purchasing a discreet vape and has the money to do so.

If you guys have any specific questions about it that I didn't cover here feel free to ask!

**tl;dr**

I like the PAX, the MFLB is great but the looks, ease of use, and precise control of the PAX make it a superior product.

pros:
sleek and cool
heats up fast and works great

cons:
lower third of the device gets warm during operation
its a little slippery because its made of metal

**Comparison to MFLB**

Aesthetics: PAX (although this is subjective)

Discretion: PAX (The MFLB LOOKS like a smoking implement, I could set the PAX on my coffee table and no one would know what it was)

Ease of Use: PAX (no learning curve, precise temp control)

Battery Life: MFLB (only an issue on LONG trips with out power)

Warranty: MFLB (PAX offers 10 years, which SHOULD be fine, but technically the MFLB is longer)

Chamber Size: Tie (The MFLB trench might be larger, but you can pack the PAX)

Cleaning: PAX (dont have to worry about breaking the delicate screen like with the MFLB)

Effect: PAX (Again this is subjective, but I find the PAX hits harder)

Cost: MFLB 

**Tally**

MFLB: 3.5

PAX: 5 **(winner)**

I like vapes because of the smooth feel, but I want the high I only get from joints and bongs. MFLB provides an active high, still very lucid, where I can go about my actions without worry while still high.

Is there a better vape to add into my rotation? So in addition to my functional high, I can also achieve a couch lock shot into orbit type of high I use to get on pipes and bongs?

I can get my product hotter then the MFLB (even with the power adapter) without combusting, which i assume is due to the glass between the heating element and the filling chamber. I still love and use my MFLB daily, but now when i want to step up the vapor output i have the right tool for the job.

I'd say definitely well worth the $120, I was lucky enough to get one for the intro price of $100, but i noticed today there are some unfinished units for even cheaper at $80, now is the time to strike!

I'd still like to have a discussion about this so here goes!

This weekend I made my first edibles (edible, really) with abv and wanted to give some sort of report on how it went. So here goes, details are based off memory and some notes I took:


I made one firecracker using a graham cookie and Nutella with exactly half a tablespoon of abv (so 7.5 ml). My abv comes from an Arizer EQ and I vape around 205°C, it's a fairly dark brown. I wrapped the cracker in foil and left it 30 minutes at 225°F in the oven. I then cut it up in 4 parts to better control the intake.


11:05 am: ate 1 quarter. Had not eaten anything else yet that day.


11:35 am: filled a bowl and vaped a few good hits, then left to go see Oz the Great and Powerful in 3D (sober girlfriend was driving just in case). Brought a second quarter of the cracker with me for future use. By the time we sit down for the movie (12:10 pm) I am at a solid [6] but I surmise this is mostly from vaping. I am however getting a nice mellow bodily high that I imagine is from the edible, but it's not very strong.


approx 13:30: I figure I'm about half-way through the movie and the mellow high hasn't grown stronger, in fact I'm more at around [4] so I eat the second quarter of my cracker.


15:00: movie's over and girlfriend wants to do some quick shopping for end-of-season winter boots sales, I am feeling happy and oblige. I would say I'm still at [4] but it's a very nice and mellow high, happy and smiling (I am not much of a smiling person ordinarily). I am not having any trouble interacting with people and being out in public.


15:30: I eat my first actual food of the day because by then I am getting hungry.


17:00: back at home after shopping, am still around [3] or [4], comfortable and happy but not very high.
I vaped for the rest of the evening and that's it.


So overall, a nice experience if a little underwhelming. At first I was a bit nervous about putting myself in public view after eating an edible but I figured if it got out of control I could always leave the movie and chill in the car listening to music. Honestly, I was looking for a bigger high than this from my edible. I still have half of the cracker left, next weekend I will eat both pieces at once and see if it gives me a different result. Any questions, comments, suggestions, tips, whatever, don't hesitate!!


Question for you guys: do you think the fact that I had not ingested food at all that day before taking the edible would have an impact on my experience? What is considered best practice in terms of food to maximise your edibles potency?

I don't have all these vapes myself, of course, so each day or so I'm going to ask a question about everyone's vapes relating to one of the columns in the table.  And today's column will be 'Optimal Load Size'.

So, how much do you pack in your vape or vapes to get the most satisfying hits?  It's no point packing half a gram if it means your forehead feels like it's caving in as you toke.  But then pack too little and sure, you'll have good airflow, though unfortunately it'll be with a bit too much emphasis on the 'air' part.  So how much do you load to get thick vapour while still allowing for decent airflow?  

PS Neither the list of vapes nor the list of columns are mean to be comprehensive - the table is very much a work-in-progress, though it's not going to be able to list every vape and every minor detail of course.

1362702882.0,16,self.vaporents,19vpqk,Da Vinci does it right!,Hojeekush,17,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/19vpqk/da_vinci_does_it_right/,"Like many folks on this subreddit, having a vaporizing device is essential for me in order to medicate efficiently, regularly, and without advertising my medical status to the entire world (social stigma is a bitch). 

After saving some money and doing some research, I decided on purchasing the Da Vinci. I think the fact that it can pass for a 2-way radio at first glance is what sold me, but it was also highly recommended by my local headshop.

Unfortunately, after a week of use, my vape [started to fall apart](http://i.imgur.com/bIDEns1.jpg). To make it doubly difficult, I had purchased the Da Vinci only days before moving to a new city for work. Knowing how difficult it would be for me to return this product to the vendor, I emailed Da Vinci directly to explain the situation and express my dissatisfaction with the product quality, as mine appeared to be a dud.

Within a couple of hours, I had a reply from Da Vinci customer service. They could easily have ignored me and suffered little loss financially, but instead, they chose to go out of their way to coordinate internationally (I'm in Canada) with their distributor here who actually called me to apologize, and offer a replacement device from a shop in my new city! They really went out of their way to make sure I got a working device at no extra cost to me. I picked up [my replacement](http://i.imgur.com/29hWpqr.jpg) and it has been working great!

Vape technology is progressing rapidly, and with that, we're continually bombarded with dozens of devices all claiming to be the best. Though there are several devices such as the Da Vinci, MFLB, or the NO2 that people swear by, one of the most important factors for folks like me that are on a budget, is assurance. 

Da Vinci has convinced me that they stand behind what they sell, and really came through for me when I explained what a pinch I was in. So if anyone is considering purchasing their first vape, and feeling nervous about dropping $ on a product, I can tell you from personal experience that Da Vinci is committed to their customers and stand behind what they sell.

If anyone from Da Vinci ever reads this, thanks again!

Now imma go eat some chicken :P

Guy.

Hey guys.

You want a motherfucking [10]?  Or more bang for your buck?

Before you cap your AVB, grind.  That.  Shit.  Up.  To a powder.

I mean this politely, as I want you to get the best experience for your dollar, but not grinding it to a powder is doing a disservice to your bud, and your gut.  

Some of you may have noted stomach issues - this can be from larger leaf product that can irritate some intestinal tracts, especially depending on dosage and contents of stomach.

Grinding your AVB to a powder means you get the most surface area for your intestines to absorb THC/CBD/CBN/etc from.  It also means you get much more in a capsule meaning a higher dosage, or a smaller capsule is now feasible as it carries a higher dose.

And think of it, how many nutriceutical/pharmaceutical/supplemental products have you found that don't have a powder inside of a capsule when it contains plant material?  Exactly.

The finer you can get it, the better.  A coffee grinder is a sure fire way to turn a lot of AVB into powder quickly.

Good luck, Vaporents.  I humbly wish you happy vaping and optimal oral extraction!

and I collected close to a **quart of vaped bud**. 
I usually bun on heat setting 4/5, so not ALL of the possible cannabinoids were extracted (not that all would've been on 7 either).

So me and some frients got together one day a few months back and we made our first ever brownies. We bought a half O of some dense FROSTY dank, split that into two quarts, saved one quart for vaping/ smoking 
(I don't smoke, but my frients don't have vapes themselves).

So we dump a quart of some finely ground POTENT dank into the mix, along with my rather large accumulation of vaped erbzzz, it was also **close to a quart of vaped bud**. 

I thought ""meh, it's vaped anyway, not like it'll actually do anything significant.""

we made weed oil, filtered out the erb leftovers and poured it into the mix. We bake the brownies and before we know it they're ready. **Let me mention that this was the first time any of us had eaten any form of cannabis**. The batch was **between 5 of us**, including myself, and we had **4 brownies each**. 

We ate two each to begin with, and they were the **best tasting brownies I've ever eaten**. ( We had one vape bowl prior to this, but that was several hours ago to pass the time of cooking) 

After about an hour it started to kick in. I turn to my mate and say ""can you feel it yet?"" He says ""Not really, I need a drink though"" We both stand up, and **it felt like the air was made of custard** literally  moving was a challenge, like pulling your limbs through toffee.

We all thought this was hilarious and after a while we adjusted to it, **but then it happened**. We go back into the kitchen and we all have the munchies. We decide that we're not AS high as can be, so we have one brownie each. Well my frients manage to eat 2 each **without even knowing**, whilst I refrained from doing so.

Needless to say we get higher and higher until it was **literally sickening to be alive**. I felt horrible, my skin was weird, I was thirsty but the act of drinking made me nauseous, I was hungry but the thought of food was sickening and I couldn't move to make it. By about 12 I go to bed, my one frient passes out on the sofa, face first in a pillow, and **I woke up every two hours in a hot sweat**. At one point I thought I was being eaten by a giant octopus and the duvet was the tentacles.  

I was high for two days after this, and it put me off getting high for a little while. 

I recently read a comment to a post here about how eating enough vaped bud will mess you up in a bad way, and I wondered if this had any significance to this story? Could it have been the quart of vaped bud that tipped us over the edge? I had never thought of that before.

Any experience or opinions would be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading this!

(Pardon my user name, I'm a NoFapper)

**Edit -** 
Thanks for all of the responses, contrary to what you may think we did weeks of research prior to this. 
The conclusion we came to was that -
'by eating the amount of weed that usually gets you high, you will get **almost** twice as high, however it will span over a longer period of time and take longer to kick in' 

**If we consider vaped bud as fresh, that means between 5 of us we had just over 1.5g each.** 
Weeks after this event we continued vaping and smoking the leftover dank, and we concluded that it is some of the most potent and high quality herb we've ever bought, so this clearly had something to do with the extreme high (aside from over-indulging).

After the list is made it could be organized into a cool chart that makes it easy to read and find a specific type of vape. I'll start it off!

When you have a small amount of bud, or any amount of bud for that matter with the **Ploom Pax**, If you hit it upside down (mouthpiece facing down) you get larger and harder hitting rips. The weed sits on the heater instead of getting stuck to the magnetic lid.

Also after hitting the **Ploom Pax** let the vape cool down right side up (mouthpiece facing up) so the resin does not stuck to the mouthpiece and it wont get stuck in your unit.  
--Thanks to MadDogTannen for this one!


For the **Arizer Extreme Q** you can take rips directly from the elbow piece. If you pack herb tightly in the screen and turn the temperature up a bit more than you would typically start off at (I stick around 215 degrees centigrade) you will get gb quality rips but its vapor so its sick! (be prepared to cough haha)

Also with the **Arizer Extreme Q** using the whip seems to get you higher quicker and cooks the herb more evenly than when using bags. I personally like to start off with the whip and transfer to bags to finish off the session. The herb still has good color and I'll hit my first bag, after the whip, at around 225 o 230, and the bags are full of thick vapor. It can be intimidating because your already so ripped!

**TL;DR**
Post any cool tricks you ents know for operating your vape! 

Mine may already be widely known but these ideas can still attract new users, help them choose between a vape, and maybe even inspire some creativity. Either way spread the love and happy vaping!

I settled on the Pax for a number of reasons

* Aesthetic design
* Portability
* Decent reviews
* Didn't want an MFLB

I had never vaped before and so I'm still struggling a bit with the learning curve. More on that in a bit.

The Pax is attractively packaged and presented. The unit itself has a nice heft to it and feels well made. 

The charging base is less sturdy than expected made but is functional.

After charging it I opted to run it for 5 minutes dry as suggested on another web forum. Then I ground up some Himalayan Gold and gave her a whirl.

The device heats up pretty quickly and the operation is slick. Simply click out the mouth piece and she heats up and the light turns green when you are ready to go. The draw is pretty strong - you have to use some lung power.

The unit also does get quite hot I must say but to be honest, I sort of expected it to. 

I find it *very* difficult to know how much I'm taking in as you can't always easily see the vapor (being in a cooler room or outside helps a lot though) so I'm finding this adjustment quite difficult to make.

I certainly notice hits but it can be a bit difficult to judge just how much you are taking in. The taste is great and it feels way cleaner. The other night I put some hash in my pipe with a bit of regular cannabis and I was coughing up a lung!

I collected a bit of AVB and one night I decided to put this in a milkshake - holy cow. I was zonked out after 2 hours, a very nice high arose from after 1 hour and I drifted into a delicious sleep after about 3.

I clean mine every 2 sessions or so - **don't waste your money with a Pax cleaning set!** it's just pipecleaners and some iso wipes at a ridiculous markup! I thought it might have been something more at the time haha.

I find the vaping high quite different and how it comes up is quite sudden. I think ultimately I will continue to combust as the highs are different - certainly with Sativa strains a joint or two hits on a pipe then being creative seems better than the vape but we shall see.

**Tl;DR** 

* Solid construction and performance. 
* Gets a bit hot
* AVB is amazing in milkshakes!
* Charge holds well
* No issues so far but I am trying to keep it clean

Hope this helps someone.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_1624nt,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1624nt/pax_review_by_a_newbie_to_vaping/,

**pros**

&gt; easy to pack the herb capsules. just scoop some plant material in, pack it down, repeat.

&gt; heat temperature adjust is easy to use.

&gt; can get veryyyyyyyyy thick vapour clouds (if you're into that)

&gt;herb tastes very pure.

&gt; high seems to set in faster than other vapes i've used.

&gt;cap is smell proof.

&gt;great battery life

**cons**

&gt; herb capsules are very fragile, and if they bend/crunch are very hard to get into a shape that they can fit into the unit still (messed one up, took 10 mins of fiddling).

&gt; with the cap off, you can smell the flowers very easily.

&gt; cap is a bitch to take off.

&gt; a little big, hard to fit into most female pockets or some male skinny jeans.

&gt;not very discreet at all. even on the lowest setting, a lot of vapour is produced and it's hard to ghost effectively.


**Compared to MFLB**

size: about 3 times as long 

smell: inh004 is much smellier 

""kick"": inh004 hits a lot harder, but a PA can bring the mflb to be very comprable. 

loading/unloading ease: MFLB is easier to load/unload 

ease of use: inh004 is much easier to actually hit. 

easier to clean: inh004 doesn't really require a lot of cleaning due to capsule design.

bottom line: MFLB is better for in a dorm room or when you want a slower buzz.

**compared to puffit**

size: inh004 is about twice a long. 

smell: inh004 is smellier. 

""kick"": inh004 hits faster, but the puffit hit's just as hard once it's been warmed up. 

loading/unloading ease: about the same. 

ease of use: about the same. 

easier to clean: inh004 requires very little cleaning, but so does the puffit.

bottom line: puffit is much better for discretion and use in public places.

**conclusive opinion on INH004** a great vape for chilling with friends or when you want to really taste the herb. it's an amazing device, however, it't not very discreet, so be careful when using it.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,penguin,True,t3_15a0kz,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/15a0kz/got_my_inh004_yesterday_here_are_some_thoughts/,

(tl;dr at bottom, but you really should read the whole thing)

~~i have an MFLB (my wonderful c3-po, new one with the brassy screen) and i love it. however, i got the PA and a whip about 2 weeks ago and it has since become my at-home vape, which it is great at being.~~

~~i still take it places occasionally, but recently i was in a hookah bar alternating shisha and vapor hits and realized that the batteries really are a pain in the ass when trying to be discrete. (was engaging in my pocket and then quickly lifting to my mouth for hits after 10 seconds).~~

~~so here's what i am looking for: a discreet, portable vape that wouldn't raise any suspicion if it was found in my pocket or bag or if i even had it sitting on a table. maybe something that looks like a pen or some kind of computer equipment (i'm a bit of the geeky type).~~

~~however, i also want it to be fairly cheap, as in less than $200 for the whole set up if possible. usb chargeable would be amazing for the whole ""computer stuff"" excuse. but i would love something that is also easy to refill, so i can do it quicky in a bathroom or whatever when i am out an about for long periods of time.~~

~~and a good warrantee would be awesome.~~

~~some things i found are:~~

**[the gentleman's ambassador kit](http://gentlemansvapes.com/products/ambassador-kit-v2) (the most likely)**

~~[the themovape](http://thermovape.com/collections/botanical-convection-vaporizers/products/thermovape-evolution-lv-low-voltage-kit-black) (not usb adaptable, but i may be able to disguise as a cosplay sonic screw driver or lightsaber or something) (lol i'm such a nerd)~~

~~[and the ploom pax](http://www.ploom.com/pax) (a little expensive. actually really expensive, but love that it charges usb)~~ off the list because it doesn't come with a usb charger and i was misinformed apparently.

~~if you have any suggestions that i should check out, or have any experience with any of these, let me know please :) the ambassador is what i am most likely going to go with, so info on that would be amazing.~~

thanks :)

**TL;DR** looking for a sleek portavape that i could explain away easily if i am caught with it.

**edit** ok! i ended up going with the ambassador kit. i placed the order earlier today and it is being shipped out tuesday, and i should have it by the following tuesday. and since i haven't seen one yet, i'll write a review as soon as i try it comparing it to other vapes i've tried, the mflb in particular.

the reason i chose this was mainly for the reason that you essentially get 2 really crisp looking, portable vapes for only $86, including once a discount code was applied ( 20offENTS ) that come with and charge via usb. they also have pass through, which means that you can use them while they are charging, so that's a great option too.

i didn't choose the pax because it's expensive and no usb. no thermovape because you have to worry about loose batteries and no usb.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,1346466057.0,,penguin,True,t3_z5ago,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/z5ago/i_have_an_mflb_but_am_looking_into_another/,

Set the plate on top of a frying pan half filled with water on a stovetop set to low-medium heat and let it sit like that until all the liquid iso is evaporated, then scrape it up with a razor blade.

I have been using e cigs for ~ 2 months now and I think they would be ideal for pot but I cant find any consistent/up to date info on how to do it. I have seen various mentions of dry herb attachments, but I am confused about whether they actually vaporize anything or just burn it (because if it burns it I dont see the point frankly).

Ideally I would like to make a PG/VG mix that I can use with my pen as needed.

I've seen various (conflicting) info about how to do this and I'd love it if someone in the know could point me in the right direction. 

Specifically I was wondering:

Does using PG/VG make a difference? I prefer a 50/50 mix - is that fine to make a thc e e juice?

What voltage/ohm combo is needed?

How much bud would I need to use to make a tincture? The sidebar suggests an oz per 75 mg but I was hoping to use waaaaaay less (like 3 or 4 grams tops) and possibly make a smaller batch. I also live in California if that matters, so would a dispensary bought tincture work as well?

What is the best intake method? Carto, clearo, drip?

First, I was totally set on buying the Pax, but looking further I found it had some problems with the mouth piece and cleaning and isn’t good heavy use (I smoke 3-5 times a week). Now, I’m pretty set on the Arizer Solo. I just have a few questions for anyone who owns one…


How easy is it to clean and how often do you need to clean it?


I heard there were problems with the glass pipe/mouthpiece coming loose. Any comments about that? 


Most importantly (for me), I have a pretty low tolerance and it usually stays pretty low no matter how much I smoke. I like to keep it that way (it keeps things pretty cheap). I saw some videos on people packing the bottom of the mouth piece and was wondering if you need to pack the whole thing for it to work best. I know this is the case for some vapes. 


Also, if I do pack the whole thing but don’t want to finish it, can I save the rest of it for later or does the unit still stay hot and vaporize the weed even if I’m not taking hits (does this make sense? (I know this is a problem with some other vapes as well)). 


I have been thinking about mixing weed with something else like chamomile, mint or lavender. I’m guessing you can put other herbs in the solo as well, right? Anyone ever try this? How was it?


Sorry for all the questions and if some of them are common sense. I’m new to vapes so bear with me!

Well, I had seen a post saying the bud had already activated thc to thc-a making it actively absorbable or something.  I put them in capsules and although I had no clue how much was in the capsules, I guessed it was around 3 grams.  In hindsight it was more like 5. 

I swallowed half and waited 50 minutes.  I felt nothing.  I decided might as well take the rest, I knew I had over 2g of it and thats all I need, why split it up and get 2 mediocre highs.  after finishing what may have been 4-5grams of avb in pill form, I wash my girl friends dog at this place for 35 minutes, I still feel very little, subtle funny feelings but not much.

I have heard it more insanely beautiful while on LSD and slightly less while on 25i but this was awesome in its own league of drug.

I then became overly, overly tired.  It was impossible to stay up and I felt sedated.  I have had one crazily scary brownie trip where I panicked and blacked out, this was because I had rationalizing that I had been given a different drug.

I now knew this was weed so I relaxed.  I didn't stress I tried sleeping but everything just seemed to become a bit more trippy just absolutely trippy.  I sometimes get this after smoking but this was another world. The high lasted about 6 hours and it was pretty enjoyable aside from I clearly could not drive.  

In conclusion, if you want to do something with your vaped weed, put it in pills and swallow it.  Enjoy that for a little :) you deserved it.

Sometimes I get minor transient aches and tightness. There are weeks when I don't vape/smoke, and I'm quite certain that I start breathing better and don't experience the aches. I own Vapor Brothers, and have used a few others and I think most of the good ones have similar effectiveness.

Could it be just anxiety? I've never really had that problem, but I do tend to contemplate/think about my health.

Maybe just accept the fact that even vaporizing will contain some amounts of smoke-tar-carcinogens? Perhaps I should just cut down my vaping a little.

Edit: as promised, it's now time for Vaporizing your MMJ 101.  Take your seats, and please pass yesterday's homework to the front.

First, open your [study guide](http://www.canna-test.com/cannabinoids.html), and let's take a brief overview of what the effects of different cannabinoids are and what their relevant temperatures are.  Then we'll go over the relevant temperatures (and color of the AVB, to the best of my ability, for those of you that don't have a fancy vape), so you can know what's coming into your lungs and what should be left in your AVB.  Finally, we'll go over a few strains so you can apply what you know and select strains to maximize your chosen effects.

* THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol): you guys know what this one is.  THC gets you high.  It's the most prevalent cannabinoid found in the majority of strains, and it has the lowest boiling point (~315° F), which is why a relatively low temperature vape almost never results in ""couch lock.""  Any high quality bud should have plenty of this, and you shouldn't have to work to get it in your system.
* CBD (Cannabidiol): CBD actually works against THC as far as getting you ""high"" goes, but it does have anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), antiepileptic, analgesic (pain reduction), and antiemetic (nausea reduction) properties.  It acts as a sedative, and it can also be used to aid sleep. CBD boils between ~320-360° F, so the amount left will depend directly on how hot and for how long you vaporize, but lighter colored, tan AVB should have most of the CBD left.  Strains with OG Kush genetics generally have relatively high CBD content, and some medical strains have been bred to be particularly high in CBD, such as Luca Brasi (Bubba Kush x Corleone) or Sour Kush (Sour Diesel x OG Kush).
* CBN (Cannabinol): Fun fact: CBN was actually isolated in the lab before THC, all the way back in 1896.  CBN is a sedative and analgesic.  It reduces pain, inflamation, and muscle spasms.  The boiling point of CBN is ~365° F, which means that you shouldn't be inhaling much of it through the vape until the bud is turning a dark tan or even brown.  Most strains are relatively low in CBN, but THC degrades into CBN during storage, so save your old dried up stuff (assuming you're storing it right) for when you've got muscle pain/headache and just want to take a nap.
* CBC (Cannabichromene) and THCV (Tetrahydrocannabivarin): These chemicals act as THC agonists (increasing the effects) and are found in small amounts in most strains, but the boiling point is ~428° F **(edit: it has been brought to my attention that the temperature I referenced for THCV was inaccurately listed, and the actual boiling point is currently unconfirmed in lab results)**, so you shouldn't be getting much of this through your vaporizer unless you're vaping all the way to black.  That being said, if you consume your AVB orally before a session, you should notice that you're getting quite a bit higher and that the high lasts for longer than if you're vaping by itself.  CBC also has some analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects, but it can cause constriction of the blood vessels.  THC is a vasodilator, so it's generally not a problem, but those of you with high blood pressure may choose to avoid consuming your AVB by itself.",,False,self,t5_2upjd,1369787016.0,,,True,t3_1ey9m4,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1ey9m4/vaporizer_science/,

I'd expressed an interest in vaping as I smoke regularly and was trying to get away from smoking in general (recently stopped smoking cigarettes).

I get it home, plug it in, fill it, and fire it up.  The number climbs from room temp to 400 degrees F... and nothing.  I can't pull anything.  I'd had varying luck with vapes before, and didn't give it much of a chance after that.

Fast forward several months, and I'm an Ent of old that only discovered that's what I'm called, and this subreddit got me thinking about that old vape... So I opened it up, and there was some AVB in there, and I noticed that the mouthpiece comes apart by unscrewing the screen at the top from the mouthpiece itself.  The mouth tube was not attached, so I had a clear view of what was ACTUALLY going on.  There was a small glob of resin caked perfectly filling the small hole.  I was literally pulling nothing.

One trip to the sink with hot water and a paper clip later, and now she's hitting like a dream.  I'm going to go vape for this fortnight, starting now.  I also have a Puffit vape which is nice on the go, but it doesn't have the kick for regular use.

I've heard a LOT about the PAX since it came out, lots of great stuff. however, it's $250 and i'm having a hard time justifying just buying it.

I currently own an MFLB, and LOVE IT. I have the MFLB, the PA (waiting on the car adapter to arrive), some 2700 batteries, and a nice whip.

can someone compare the PAX to the MFLB (with the PA)?

here's what i'm specifically wondering:

1) trench size. Which is bigger? MFLB or PAX?

2) heat up time. with the PA, i have to wait about 4-5 seconds before i see vapor (at the temperature i like). how about with the PAX?

3) risk of buring the herb. with the mflb it's very easy to burn the herb a bit if you aren't paying attention... how about with the PAX?

4) smell: which is smellier when newly packed (no vaping yet).

5) stirring: do you have to stir the bud in the pax?

6) ease of maintenance/cleaning: the mflb is very easy, just open the lid and brush it off, how's the pax?

7) warrantee. what's the PAX's?

8) I know there are MFLB knockoffs available that work just as well.  Does the pax have any yet?

They put a little notch in to catch the acrylic lid so it stays in place, but the notch is deeper than it needs to be. When I was shaking it to mix up the weed, I saw tiny pieces spilling out. Modified my shake technique and no more issues.

I realize you guys must see a ton of ""which vaporizer should I purchase?"" requests, but I could really use some advice from the pros :)
My mom recently agreed to take advantage of our newish medicinal marijuana law (Yay!) to help combat her cancer related issues (Booo!). We talked about her options, and she thinks a vaporizer would be her best bet. I've been scouring reviews for awhile since she has no internet at home.... and now I feel completely overwhelmed. Vaporizers are definitely new territory for me.
At this point, she has a $300ish price limit. I'm hoping this will be enough for a good, easy to use unit. She is not good with technology at all (I still have to go over there and fix anything that shows a blinking 12:00 after power outages), so ease of use and cleaning is a pretty huge factor here. 
If any of you have a recommendation or some words of wisdom you'd be willing to throw our way, I would be SO appreciative! Thank you for your time!

EDIT: I shared the feedback I had so far with my mom and she wanted me to ""Thank the nice people on the internet for taking a moment to help me out"".

I keep seeing people talk about the thick clouds their vapes throw off, and I was thinking about the way I vape and what I heard on /r/trees a while ago.

I remember hearing that whenever you see vapour in your exhale, it's wasted, and that you can hold vape hits in until they're gone, unlike with smoke. (because vapour lacks of the bad stuff that you absorb by holding in smoke hits too long) 

I personally take smaller hits and hold it in until there's no vapor left, and it seems to be remarkably efficient. This is the way I've always done it, and I'm somewhat confused as to why people don't do that. 

Is it just me, or am I right in thinking that people are exhaling massive clouds of cannabinoids just for the showy effect?

I can pass this thing off as a wireless hotspot and no one would be the wiser. It's such a stealthy and suave piece of equipment and is a huge factor in why I love it. The all-in-one aspect, the engaging and minimal LED, the solid construction, etc. Oh, did I mention it vapes the flowers extremely well?

I've used a MFLB before, but this is just in a league of its own. If someone is thinking about buying a portable, I highly recommend the PAX over everything else I've seen. If not only for its simplicity, but its warranty and performance.

Definite 10/10- would buy again.

I'm new to this side of reddit. I've been smoking daily for about 6 years, and recently quit cigarettes. After quitting cigarettes, I started getting more and more into healthy stuff, and figured, hey, I might as well smoke healthy. I decided to take a t-break last week until I got myself a vaporizer.

I've used desktop vaporizers before (specifically the volcano), but never a handheld. I've read some reviews on here, watched some reviews on YouTube, and read some message board reviews. 

While the MFLB seems like a simple to use and nice handheld, it doesn't seem to do the trick for a lot of ENTs. I myself tend to smoke higher grade stuff, and smoke often (at times).

Would the Arizer Solo be something I'd like? I'm looking at purchasing a new one for $150 online, which is a great price. Just can't press myself to click the submit button on my order until I hear some reviews from fellow owners.

Thanks a ton fellow Vaporents.

Being a vape noob, I decided I would share my experience with you all. 
(r/vaporents helped me TONS when deciding my first vape, and I would like to extend that to other ents who are looking to invest in a piece).

* I placed my order at 11:25am PST; (cut off time for same day shipping is 11:30am PST) and BAM! i received it the next day.
(i was SO surprised.. so surprised when the fedex guy called me to say that no one was at the office to receive it-- and a little freaked out, honestly-- i was just paranoid... :P) but all was well, and he came back and dropped it off a couple of hours later. (another reason i love FEDEX! and not usps/ups).

* Anyways! I was on a t-break until easter.. so last night was my first puff with my vape. Got my bowl of mangoes, netflix, and packed my oven tightly. [Thank you for all who told me the basics: grind it finely, pack it tightly, and draw slowly]. 

* Vape high was a different high, but I felt like it was very ... light. Not in its potency, but the way it made me feel. I didn't feel too groggy, and I felt like - hey, I can function with this no problem. 

* anyway, I would just like to say THANKS to all vaporents out there, keep doing what you do, because - well, I sure appreciated it!

On the other hand, the Pax looks so freaking nice, it's very discreet and portable, but I'm not sure if it can give me the power I want when I'm at home. I don't have a huge reason to be discreet in my own house, but the option to take it on the go is very appealing.

And on my third hand, I could not spend the money, and get the PA for my MFLB - that way I still have good portability (not as good as the pax), but have the power.

Price is not an issue here but I'm looking to see which would be of better use for me and my group of friENTS. I'm a pretty frequent ""smoker"" but I can't smoke in/near my household due to anti-weed parents so i end up smoking with friends at a friend's house. I smoke with friends because my parents get all mad and such when they see me with red eyes so I'm with my friends for most of the high. With that being said, i rarely have solo seshes. I only have one friend where we are able to smoke in the house so our seshes are usually in the backyard or somewhere outside. Recently, I've been wanting to vape because it may be me or the weed but every time, after a sesh, my eyes would get SUPER itchy and i would have pretty bad sniffles. It may be the weed though because I've been with a new dealer that's been selling me the same strain since we linked, says its purple kush. Anyway, the indoors would be ideal for vaping with a group of friends so i wanted to get one. In the households (mine and friends), there's usually a table for an SSV to be placed but the LSV seems like it would be more practical in the sesh due to it's mobility. Im in need of some help here and if anyone would be kind enough to give some pros and cons about each vape, that would be kindly appreciated :)

Unfortunately, we don't live in an ideal world, so with vapes (for herb at least, as opposed to oil), there will be a trade-off when you free yourself from mains power (aside from recharging, that is).  There is only so much oomph that a battery (or butane can/lighter) can manage.  And of course, having to recharge can get annoying.

So if you're buying your first vape, ask yourself what is most important to you.  If you're a light-to-moderate smoker, then a portable might be perfectly sufficient for your needs. But if you like to rip fat bong-hits, you're likely to find most portables lacklustre.

The portables were ""ok"", but I just didn't get that same feeling when vaping compared to combustion.

Anyway, I bought the DB based on the advice from many of you here.  So far, I am very impressed with it.  Here are some of my thoughts on it:

Hits way better than either of the portables I have tried.  No comparison really.  In fact, you can get as close to combustion as you want by adjusting the heat level so you can easily get those cough hits.

I'm sure I am not the first one to do this, but I was holding both the wand and the mouthpiece in one hand on the last hit of a sesh and decided to take one last pull and get the rest of the vapor from inside the whip.  Got the wrong end and ended up inhaling a bunch of AVB. :)

Get extra screens if you are a first time user.  If you have the heat up too high you will scorch a little bit and this will dirty the screen fast.  I would say the only true con I could come up with about the DB is it seems like I go through a lot of screens (1 every 3-4 days I would guess).  Is this normal or am I just getting it too hot?  BTW, also got a titanium pick.  They are awesome!

I had a few little pieces of herb ""pop"" and drop down inside the heating element.  Is there an easy way to clean this or is it even necessary?  I tried inverting the DB itself of course, but the 2-3 pieces of AVB down there seems stuck to the bottom and won't fall out.  Not a big deal, just curious.

Very nice quality all the way around.  They are expensive, but I felt I got my money's worth this time around!",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_176c04,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/176c04/da_buddha_impressions_after_3_weeks/,

After doing some reading I decided it would be best to pack the bowl nice and tight and start with the medium heat setting. This thing is incredible. I am floored by how simple works. Just pop up the mouth piece, wait for the light to turn from purple to green, and you can start! One tight bowl lasted a decent session between me and a buddy. After a few pulls I set it to high and got a bit more out. Taking a pull is a bit difficult, you kind of have to draw hard and keep a seal with your lips around the mouth piece, but the air is never harsh. (Also I may have packed it a little too tight?) The flowers came out light brown and toasty, but certainly not burnt.

1344966981.0,11,self.vaporents,y7p8g,Experiments with standard eGo style e-cigs and Honey oil. What has worked what has not worked,ebrake,14,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/y7p8g/experiments_with_standard_ego_style_ecigs_and/,"I just wanted to share some of my experiments for others that might be interested in discrete vaping with concentrates (BHO, honey oil hash, earwax etc.)

In an effort to save my lungs from dammage I invested in a volcano, MFLB, and replaced cigarettes with eGo style e-cigs. Everything has been better than expected, however I found myself wanting to medicate anywhere and the MFLB while awesome just isnt a good option for places like airports where your greens are easy to identify and explaining why you are shoving AA batteries into a wood box is hard to explain.

This led me to experimenting with honey oils.  The eGo style e-cigarette is so convenient I wanted that option for medicating. Things I have learned in the process:

1. You can make your own ""juice"" much easier than you think.  Buy nicotine free e-juice, warm it up by setting the bottle in some hot water and then add about .2 .3grm of BHO for 10ml of juice. Shake and it will mix beautifully.  Using a direct drip atomizer on my e-cig this juice works great, makes a nice cloud of vapor and a nice medicated state kicks in after your 4-5th drag.

2. Using empty e-cigarette cartridges/tanks with medicated juice does work, however a lot of your juice will be stuck in the filler material so you lose about 30-40% that cant be recovered.  Nicotine cartridges generally use filler/wicks since nicotine juice is so cheap its a non issue, it is an issue with BHO based juice that can be expensive.  If you can afford the waste this is a great way to go.  Perfect for travel, you cant spill it, stores for long periods of time, and it can be used anywhere and it looks/smells 100% like an e-cig.

3. A BHO specific cartomizer is on the market from gentlemansvapes.com that has no filler material so there is no waste.  This product is great, however the taste of pure oil is kinda gross and off putting.  These carts also get VERY hot so I found myself getting burned by accident a lot the first day I had one.  They are also difficult to load and produce almost no visable smoke so its hard to claim you are just using an e-cig when you are not blowing out any clouds after taking a drag.

I solved the loading problem by putting the BHO in the freezer for a bit to harden it up. Then you can roll it in your fingers to make a small thin rope that can be dropped right inside the cart. Gotta move fast tho while its cool, if it warms up in your fingers to much you have a mess on your hands.

I solved the hot burning problem by investing in a cheap cone cover for my eGo battery.  Its like a heat shield over the cart.  They make them for cosmetic reasons but they work great to prevent burns.

Solved the taste/no smoke problem by adding 6-10 drops of the medicated juice after loading the pure BHO.  Now it tastes like the juice (I like blueberry waffle flavor) and produces a nice vapor cloud just like a regular e-cig. 

I put about .5 gram of BHO in my cart with 10 drops of the juice on top. Im getting between 400-600 hits before it needs to be refilled. (Compared with 60-120 hits on the regular nicotine carts with medicated juice)

4.  Most important thing I learned... Batteries make all the difference in the world.  Standard eGo batteries have a set voltage, they just dont do well with the honey oil carts. It works but you gotta wait for things to heat up and the vapor isnt very thick.  I upgraded my batteries to the Joyetech eGo C-twist model, you can turn the voltage up from 3.2 to 4.8 with a quick twist.  The difference is huge, running at 4.8 on the honey oil cartridge it only takes me about 3 drags to get comfortable medicated. I got my Joye eGo Twist batteries from ivape.com for like $22 each, I like to keep two on hand at all times so there is a backup if I need it.

Overall the experiment has been a success thus far. I have used it in airports, restaurants, movies, family functions, and everywhere else in my day to day life without any questions from people around me.  If anything they want to ask about how the e-cig is working out as a cigarette replacement. 

Took me a few months of trial and error to reach this point so this is more of a summary. If anyone has questions feel free to ask away.

And you can more-or-less judge the temperature by the colour of your herb (just don't blacken it).,Bit_Chewy,15,1,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/xxcm4/another_reason_vaping_is_awesome_different/,"Cannabis contains dozens of different [cannabinoids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid), the essential oil compounds that get you high, of which THC is but one (albeit the most famous and most psychoactive one).  And these cannabinoids have different evaporation temperatures, as well as different psychoactive effects.  It is how these cannabinoids combine that produce a particular high, so the quality of your high will depend on what temperature you vape at.

Low temperature vaping, where your herb remains greenish, will give you more of a trippy and energetic head-high. Whereas higher temperatures, where your herb is fully browned, will produce more of a body-heavy 'couchlock' effect.

Of course, different strains contain different ratios of the various cannabinoids, so each strain will have its own spectrum of possible highs.   You won't get a full indica-like couchlock effect from vaping sativa at a high temperature, but you can vape an indica at low temperature to get a more sativa-like effect, since THC (relatively heavy in sativa strains) is a low-temperature-boiling cannabinoid.

You can take your herb all the way to chocolate brown if you want, but don't blacken your herb, as it's pushing toward actual combustion.  It will start to taste like burned popcorn and will be noticeably harsher.

Here's a used Da Buddha I bought on ebay for $90 after shipping, is it a good deal? I was considering getting the Arizer Extreme for $140, did I make a good choice?



Description used by seller: 

&gt;I am auctioning my gently used Da Buddha Vaporizer kit.  

&gt;This comes with all accessories and attachments, including travel bag, mouthpiece, wand, hose and pick, as well as instructions and extra screens. 

&gt;This works perfectly, no issues at all.  I am just selling it because I no longer use it but it has served me well.  Everything has been cleaned but please note that the hose, being plastic, smells a bit herbal.  You could easily get a new one if this bothers you, but it will likely just happen again.  Attachments are easy to find online and in shops.  

&gt;If you have always wanted a vaporizer but did not want to shell out $200+, now is your chance.  This is a great model!




**TLDR; I got a used DBV on ebay for $90, was considering a new EQ for $140, good deal/decision?**

Apologies in advance if this topic has been hashed to death already. I've just switched to e-cigs and I have searched and browsed and read and flummoxed in search of a way to remove tobacco from my life (and my lungs) completely, and that means giving up the old joints. I don't really get on well with pipes, and to be honest I'd like to go the whole hog and remove combustion completely.

Most of the information I've found deals primarily with greenery and not the pollen type resin that I typically get (by choice, I don't really get wasted any more as it really doesn't mix with work, and it's a lot cheaper!).

Can I stick resin in an atomiser/vaporiser that one would normally use for greenery? Or should I look for something particular? The pollen I smoke is typically high quality, it's dry and and pretty much crumbles in your fingers, I'm not sure if that makes a difference.

Many thanks for your guidance in what seems to be a whole world of choices and variables!

I am finally seriously able to look into buying a vaporizer for all the usual reasons (can toke inside/very little smell, healthier, conserves more bud, etc.) and I'm trying to find out which is better concerning how much goes in each (the oven capacity), the resulting highs from said oven size, and the smell from a usual session.

I really want the Pax, because it seems like it holds less and you don't have to shake it around (I'm a pretty non-functional stoner, if I were to mess it up while high, that could be a problem haha), and looks like less smell has the possibility of escaping (I still live with parents, and know it's possible to use a vape indoors - a friend brought his Vapir NO2 over one day while my parents were gone, and they didn't smell anything later on) - I'm worried that the MFLB has more area for both the ""raw bud"" smell and vapor to escape through both the trench and the mouthpiece, whereas the Pax just has the mouthpiece, since the oven is more securely ""covered"".

As of right now, money is kind of a minor issue, but if the Pax wins out overall, I can save up a bit more from my next paycheck and buy less bud than what I was hoping. That said, I can buy a MFLB for $75 from eBay. :P

So basically, the two main factors are what smells less (both vapor smell and raw bud smell escaping) and how much bud is needed in each trench - the MFLB seems like it wouldn't be that much different than a pipe, and the Pax seems to have a tiny oven in comparison. I have a low tolerance (relatively - I toke maybe twice a week, maybe less. Depends on how much ganja I have on hand).

Sorry for the long post. If you guys have answers concerning any of this, please let me know! Thank you!

**Edit: Thank you all for your input. It seems MFLB will be my choice - I needed to save the money for a car anyways. I don't really plan on smoking out in public where it would look out of place. I'll let you know how it goes!

I'm looking to buy my first vape tomorrow and am *super* stoked! I called some local head shops today and here's what's in stock:

Atmos Raw 

Iolite

Vapir Mini

VaporBlunt original

Now after reading reviews for each, I've pretty much eliminated the Iolite due to its short lifespan. From the remaining options, I'm leaning towards the VaporBlunt as there are a lot of positive opinions on it. 

I could also call some other local head shops tomorrow and hope for/have them order a PAX or a MFLB vape. I've heard really great things about both of these. Basically what I'm looking for is: longevity, discreetness, portability, and a quality build. The money cap is $250, 

If you were me, which would you go with? 


EDIT: Hey guys! Here's an update for those interested. I ended up going with the MFLB due to the reasonable price ($110 at a local shop), look, effectiveness, and positive reviews. Overall, I spent $200 yesterday on it, an incredible American Grinder, and an eighth of Blue Dream. Waked n baked this morning and it's mindblowing.

I found a sweet spot, between pulling too fast (which was definitely what I was doing before - and I could definitely feel the difference.  Too hard felt like a lot of pulling for nothing, which is exactly what it was.  I'm not sure of the mechanical reason, but pulling too fast doesn't produce as dense a cloud) and pulling to slowly, which didn't produce a hit (not so much hard or soft pulls, but fast or slow pulls)  Honestly, I tried to pull one iota faster than as slow as possible and that was the sweet spot.  

They were rich and potent hits that gave a nice sting in the chest.  I even coughed from a few.  I could feel the vapor fill up my lungs, instead of just kinda breeze through.  It created a swift head buzz, like from a bowl, but with no fogginess (the lack of sudden head buzz was my one complaint about the Pax). All of these feelings were significantly different than previous use.  Same strain, same settings.

This was all on low heat, so I'm looking forward to tomorrow night's sesh on med.  

Thanks for the advice from this and various other forums and redditors.

I'm a long time smoker who has mild experience with vaporizers. My first unit was an iolite, which served me brilliantly for over a year. I loved it's user friendliness, and how discrete it was, but wasn't as happy about having to carry a can of butane with me .

So I've got several options im considering, with a budget of around 200$, which isn't set in stone. I prefer a good portable vape to a desk unit, but the Extreme Q is an option im considering.

When looking through the heater cover hole I can just see about 1mm of the tip.     
I often read that combustion can easily happen in the SSV but I never have experienced anything close to that even at 3-4 o'clock.     
Most of my sessions (1/4th of the wand ; long, fast draws) seem to be done after about 4 hits already and taste quite popcorny.     
    
Does this seem normal? If not, how do I raise the heating element? It does seem to be hold in it's place by something. If everything seems to be okay, sorry for bothering!

I got the lotus vape today but despite my best efforts cannot get great hits from it. The metal plate gets really hot (and so does the lighter) but somehow it takes like 12 hits to vape one bowl and to get any kind of effect. takes forever to turn brown...

any suggestions?",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_1i2950,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1i2950/trouble_with_lotus_vape/,

my mflb is currently residing at a police station ):
so i need a new vape.

the pax looks lovely, but has no CE certification and as such importing it to europe is risky...
it also has a propietary charger which i dislike a lot.

what are some good portable vaporizers that have a micro usb port?
i already did some research, but finding one that truly has the right port isn't so easy.
the Inhalater XP looks neat, but isn't available from the manufacturer, i might look into getting it through ebay or so...

any others?",,False,self,t5_2upjd,False,,,True,t3_1hb2lj,http://www.reddit.com/r/vaporents/comments/1hb2lj/good_portable_vape_w_micro_usb_port/,
