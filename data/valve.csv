Now then. As you all may already know, Half-Life 2 was on sale yesterday. It was 66% off. 66% is 2/**3** of 100%. And when you divide 66 / 2, it equals **33**.

Okay, not that interesting. But let's go deeper.

The date of the daily deal was September **3**rd. Also, there's **3** vowels in ""september"". Those vowels are E E E.

What is EEE? Well... Electronic Entertainment Expo, E**3**.

What is next year? 201**3**

&gt;This year's DICE Summit is getting a little injection of Hollywood, as producer J.J. Abrams (Star Trek) will have a keynote discussion with Valve president Gabe Newell. The two will sit down to tackle the subject: ""Storytelling Across Platforms: Who Benefits Most, the Audience or the Player?""



&gt;Newell will also be headlining his own individual keynote address, entitled ""The View on Next Steps."" It will focus on the future of the industry, and Valve's own plans involving Steam and Big Picture to that end. He'll also be inducted into the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences Hall of Fame at the DICE Awards.

&gt;""J.J. thoughtfully weaves together suspense, action, emotion, and fun into every one of his projects - elements every game developer aspires to capture as well,"" said AIAS president Martin Rae, in the announcement. ""Each year, the D.I.C.E. Summit sets the tone for the year ahead in games and adding J.J. and Gabe's shared insights is a natural fit as we see all forms of entertainment converge.""

&gt;The DICE Summit and awards will be taking place February 5-8 in Las Vegas.

What are my options at this point?  How did the individuals who were affected with trojans break past the first level of tech support and actually have someone look into the issue, etc? The only game modes I do play on TF2 is Saxton Hale and Deathrun, both of which wouldn't benefit any if at all with hacks, not to mention it'd ruin the fun entirely. I did run trainers on single player games like Binding of Isaac on occassion, but nothing that would be designed to hook into source based games since there's a lot of downtime in those modes. I've ranged from reading e-books to movies to playing pauseable single player games. I've even run these side by side while playing other games like Planetside 2 while waiting for outfit formations and experienced no detection issues.
 
I've offered Valve the following and have been ignored and given canned responses: 
  * My gaming machine and all hard drives for analyses 
  * Bit-by-bit drive images of the 3 disks in the machine. 
  * Malware Bytes log of it locating an active trojan on my machine. 
  * Every demo that's written to disk on my server.  Which is about the only place I play on with the exception of when I'd play on a DeathRun server for TF2.
 
 
Also, I understand there will be absolute skepticism on this post since anyone who is VAC banned is automatically assumed to have been using cheats.  I'd like to keep this to a discussion of what my options are or how I could go about to get Valve to notice my issue as well as possibly many others.  I don't care if you trust me, I only care that I'm able to become part of a process in which we may improve VAC.  It's good but it's very far from perfect. See examples [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve_Anti-Cheat#False-positive_detections) and [here](http://steamreview.org/files/vac_spyeye/vac_spyeye.htm) where it is able to incorrectly detect processes running that won't even be designed to communicate or manipulate Source based software.

Valve, being typically awesome, could even use the difference between the 'You Recieve' and 'Buyer Pays' to pay the publishers.

I am currently revising the rules that exist in /r/tf2 and will post those as the rules for this subreddit, pending discussion from the other moderators.

Look at all these open source games. Wouldn't it be great if they were all as easy to install and play as simply installing them from Steam? I think everyone wins if Valve were to do this. Gamers win because games are easier to find and install and play with their friends. Game developers win because their games find a broader audience.

But the recent announcement that you won’t be able to access previous purchases unless the user accepts the terms is completely unreasonable and it made me look more closely at the contract.


Initial reactions by some people including myself was whether or not we should sue to get this repealed but thinking it over and doing a little research I see there is an alternative step that can be done before doing something so drastic, expensive and time consuming.


**My goal is to create a counter offer contract that revises two issues I think that are important.**

*1) The first issue is what options are available to a person who declines the terms of an EULA.*

*2) The second issue is that Steam is demanding for individual arbitration and we can’t as individuals consult or collaborate with the rest of our peers who are also going to an arbitration session with Valve without their consent (read: permission).*


Regarding (1) The current stance that we can’t access games we paid for is ridiculous. I’m mostly ok with EULA, aside from point (2), and even if that couldn’t be negotiated away I would still be willing to use Steam but I strongly believe others should have the option to refuse a contract they don’t like and still access what they paid for under the old contract.
Regarding (2) I agree with Valve that class action suits are expensive, time consuming and not helpful to the consumer. I don’t agree that arbitration should be restricted to the individual level because of it.


If we give up the option to arbitrate as a group we concede some of the power that made class action lawsuits necessary in the first place. I personally consider it is in our best interest from a time and money stand point to arbitrate instead of litigate. You may disagree with that. But I think we would agree that group arbitration is better than individual.


For those who have second thoughts about that contract you already agreed to, keep in mind the EULA isn’t enforced until 30 days after it first came up on Steam. You can change your mind and take part in this process to change the contract.

",ME4T,9,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/d1564/why_alien_swarm_is_the_greatest_valve_release_to/,"Alien Swarm is free, and the source sdk comes with it. Free. I can make maps, mods, and entirely new games. For free.  I can even turn around and then sell those mods as DLC*.  Pretty exciting for a gamer new to game dev.

Sure Valve starts out with negative profits, and a game that stays fun for about a month, but that is part of the beauty.  A fun, free game with such a limited replay value damn near FORCES the community to create new content.  If you like the game, you'll want it to last.  Some of us will actually start screwing around with the source sdk and hammer.

Even if the mod community totally fails us (unlikely) valve ends up with hundreds of people who are just that much better at making valve content.  If, after 6 months, they don't touch the game again, maybe they are now making maps for TF2.

This is not to say that I think Alien Swarm is a throwaway game - far from it.  This little gem has, in some form or another, an amazing array of game components for developers to expand on.  Coop, online play, experience, leveling, skill upgrades, character customization, and the list goes on.

Sure everything is limited in scope, but just wait until enough curious kids hone their source dev skills enough to really contribute, and learn to translate those concepts to other valve games.

*I'm actually not sure that this true, but I read it somewhere and cannot find the source. Can anyone confirm that I can sell DLC that I make for alien swarm?

**TL;DR:** Alien Swarm is credit to team.

So, I loved the half-life 2 games, and played most of them. being hard of hearing, one of the best things for me was the fact that the game had closed captions. Face it, you really need the dialog in these games.

So I decided to download half life source off of steam since I never played the first one. Well..I did not get very far in the game because without the captions I have no idea what is going on or what I am supposed to do.

Now, on a steam forum I saw that a guy had made a captions file for half life. (actually its in both polish and english, but hey, i'll take it.

File was found in this forum:

http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?p=29940804

However, I have no idea how to go about installing this. Can I just drop the files in a directory somewhere, or do I have to use some sort of tool?

Any help or links to tutorials will be greatly appreciated.

The Master list is pretty much generally ""Valve"", though. so I figured it might be worth a try.

Anyways, sorry if it gets a bit technical. Tips for other places I could try would also be awesome.

Here's the deal: I'm trying to connect to Valve's master server, in order to get a list of game servers. This has not... proven itself to be too easy.

Here's roughly what's supposed to happen: I send a query packet over UDP to the master server. This packet contains some info, for example what game I'm looking for, and a few other filter settings. The master server then sends me another UDP packet containing a buttload of IPs. Due to how UDP packets are ""fragmented"", I only get 200-something IPs per packet, and since UDP is not a connection-oriented protocol, I need to send a new request, including the last IP I received from the server, and get a new batch. This continues until I get an ""empty"" IP. I have all the IPs in the list now, and everybody's happy, right? Well, no.

Here's what *does* happen: I try sending a packet, and one of two things happens. Either, I get a socket error 10054 (which basically means that the Master server hangs up on me without even saying hello **:(**), OR I get some IPs. Which is good, right? Wrong again. When I send my second query packet which **does** contain the last IP of the previous one like it should (I double checked.), I just get the first bulk again. And this can happen without having changed anything in my code at all.

I read on the [documentation page](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Master_Server_Query_Protocol) that this can happen if I'm closing the socket between each transmission, but... I'm not. I double checked this too. I really don't think anything changes from time to time (except for the ""last IP"" parameter which should, and does), so I'm at my wits' end trying to figure this out.

Alternatively, is there a simpler way to get the list? I don't have a problem querying individual servers, it's just the master server. If I could download it over HTTP or something instead of this messing around with UDP, that would be so much easier.

Again, sorry if this isn't the place. I don't exactly see a lot of other programming discussions here, but I figured it'd be worth a try. I get the feeling this isn't exactly the kind of thing you contact support over...

If anybody has any clues how to fix this, how to download it in a different way, or tips on other places I could ask, please share. :)

Thanks in advance!

1. **Stay on topic.** All submissions must be related to Valve somehow. This can cover any aspect of Valve, whether related to existing games, future games, the Source engine, Steam, update speculation, promotions, cross-promotions, or the culture surrounding the company. A post will be removed if a textual explanation (such as a submission title or a caption overlaid onto an image) is required to establish how the post is related to Valve. This bans most internet memes and reaction gifs.

2. **Posts that are solely about a single game might belong elsewhere.** While /r/valve moderators will not remove posts that are only related to a single Valve game, these posts are probably better suited to subreddits dedicated to the game in question. 

3. **No commercial advertisement.** Posts advertising paid products/services such as server rental, donor benefits on public servers, premium website subscriptions, or items for sale will be removed. This rule does not apply to *free* livestreams, public server events, Steam workshop creations, or non-paid services like TF2Lobby.

4. **Bigotry and hateful language will not be tolerated on this subreddit.** The philosophy here is that the subreddit should be a safe place for anyone to come and enjoy themselves talking about Valve stuff, without being insulted for being gay, female, a minority, disabled, and so forth. Discussion about issues are fine so long as they are related to Valve and the discussion is respectful.

5. **Heavily insulting another user is unacceptable.** If you call someone a moron or a terrible player, whatever - this is the internet. But if you start really tearing someone a new asshole? He better really deserve it and be such a terrible person that I'm banning him instead of you.

6. **Starting or participating in raids from other subreddits is forbidden.** Posting links to /r/valve content in *relevant places* elsewhere on Reddit is perfectly fine, but any attempts to provoke ""raids"" or harass /r/valve subscribers from elsewhere is not allowed. While crossposts can be useful, certain subreddits are widely known for attacking other subreddits to further a cause or cause drama. If a post bothers you, please click the report button rather than use it as justification to launch a raid from elsewhere. (If you believe it is necessary, feel free to message the moderators as well.)

Also, the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules) apply, but that goes without saying.

I've got a copy of Windows 7 64-bit I'd like to install (to play shattered horizon and make all my computers the same OS.)  My problem, is that I have 90 gigabytes of Steam games.  Using the built in backup utility would take me long enough that maybe my first-born could play.  I've [copied the steamapps folder](http://www.overclock.net/pc-games/519842-best-fastest-way-backup-steam-games.html) to an external HD then back before and that's worked with just XP, with minimal issues.  Will an issue crop up when moving to an OS 2 versions ahead and also written for a different instruction set?  I don't want to have to spend days re-downloading all these games, but that's my worst-case scenario.

**TLDR;**  Moving 90GB of games from XP-32 to W7-64


**EDIT** I am still researching.  I've found [this](http://forums.bit-tech.net/showthread.php?t=171212) but there's no mention of whether it was successfully using the 64-bit versions of games or not.

**FINAL EDIT** I hate it when someone posts a question, gets advice, and then never gives an update on how it worked out so others may benefit.  That was the usual result I found when I searched google for this issue.  So here we go...  Over the weekend I copied the steamapps folder to a second drive, wiped my original and installed Windows 7-64.  I installed Steam and then shut it down and copied the steamapps folder back to my new OS.  All the games showed up as being a paused download.  I resumed each game's download and the game was available almost instantly.  HL2 Gamesaves came over fine.  For some reason I lost all my progress in Braid.  Overall, moving from xp-32 to 7-64 worked well with this method.",,False,self,t5_2qzqs,True,,,True,t3_cybv5,http://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/cybv5/how_does_one_transfer_steam_games_to_a_new_os/,

* Steam will need to be outfitted with a Credits system that can be used only for purchasing new games/DLCs. It should have two decimal places. It cannot be cashed.
* The users should be able to set the price of their games OR have a fixed selling percentage based on current non-discount value, with equal proportions from the original sale doled out to the game's producers and Valve. The remaining amount is given to the user in Credits.
* If users have a coice in price, a minimum amount based on the non-discount retail value should be required in order to re-sub a game.
* A completed game implies gameplay satisfaction, and as such, newly released games flagged as completed cannot be re-subbed until after a fair period to prevent retail market obstruction. Indie &amp; short games will be vulnerable if this policy is not in place.
* Games that are unsatisfactory upon purchase, based on play time or percentage completed, can be re-subbed. If your game is shit, too bad.
* Gifted, unplayed games operate as normal.
* A re-subbed game cannot be sold for more than it was bought for AND/OR cannot be re-subbed more than once/twice. In conflict with the price mininum, this rule takes priority.

----

* The re-sub market goes by first-come first-sell. I think this would operate best with fixed-price re-subbing.
* Game discounts in the retail market do not affect the price of re-subs to maintain competition. Companies should be allowed to compete with the huge Steam userbase and re-subbing from the traditional operation perspective is a curtesy from Valve(or a legal right if the lawsuit in Germany wins).
* Companies should have a say in whether or not their games can be re-subbed. All or nothing, no dictating on which games. If re-subbing is declared a legal right, I'm not sure what Steam and Origin and all other subscription-based games will do if they insist on not allowing people to re-sub their games.

----

* DLCs attached to the game are added to the total retail value and affect the miminum price allowed.
* A re-sub game lists all the seperate DLCs people are selling it with so users can choose the one with or without DLCs.
* Individual DLCs less than some amount of money cannot be sold individually and must be sold with the entire game.",,False,self,t5_2qzqs,False,,,True,t3_180ew6,http://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/180ew6/proposal_for_allowing_games_to_be_resubscribed_or/,

It is a game with a HUGE potesial, but is in the wrong hands. The game suffers from bugs, unbalanced weapons and few players and needs someone to fix that. 

For those who doesn't know what Empires is, I will briefly tell about it here:

Empires is a strategy game between two teams. It is sort of a mix between RTS and FPS. One player is ordering the rest of the team to do actions (Build barracks, attack and move). There are four classes with some weapons to choose from. The winner is the ones who manages to destroy the command vehicle.

I bought it the day it came out and have bought each of the DLCs twice, once for each of my households profiles. I have bought the game on steam as well. 


It is appalling that the game is so broken that I can't get through a single game of versus without myself or someone in the lobby being sent back to the valve screen. Not to mention the fact that some days the servers have no fucking gravity and everyone just levitates everywhere. 

I'll watch everyone in the lobby red bar on their connection then suddenly all jump to green when we switch sides and then back to red when we switch sides again. 

What justification can there be for such a gross lack of support when the DLC and game are still for sale on XBL basically being sold broken and unplayable? 


This isn't just a versus problem. For example, on the sacrifice, half of the achievements never unlock and 100% of the times I have played it in the last 6 months the bridge never drops so you can't finish the level. What the fucking fuck. It's bad enough that XBL users had to pay for content that was free for people using their PCs (cold stream, L4d1 maps, etc) but then to turn around and offer zero support feels like a real kick in the ass. An update would be nice, an explanation would be nice. Anything but what is currently going on with this game would be an improvement.

1370866687.0,0,self.valve,1g1gsg,since i know valve employee's i just want to write a short text about DOTA 2 and why it needs a competitive ranking system....,falcontard,7,10,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1g1gsg/since_i_know_valve_employees_i_just_want_to_write/,"Everyone whos working at Valve,

I know your really smart and make great games and products, I been on steam since 2003 and bought half-life back when it was released...

I just want you to know, we like DOTA 2 a lot the way it is now, and you're continuing to improving the game. But.

I think that a ladder system for solo-queue and what not is required for multiple good reasons. Including teaching new players to play. They want to climb ranks, and get better, they read on and play your game more.

Now, if you just made a system where people can matchmake and earn a spot in a Bronze/Silver/Gold/..../ system similiar to starcraft 2, people, especially who are professionals, would like your game more. I know friends who won't play your game because they can't rank.

The most important thing, is to make this as optional as possible.

**Rank system, ladder system, in DOTA 2, should be implemented as similiar as to SC2, but.... no item rewards or battle points are given or whatever you decide to reward people for playing your game...**

This makes it so that people have to play normal queue if you implemented a rank queue. It's not often you see people bragging on what rank they are and how good they are. You know why? Do people brag how much money they make then another? No, but some are and that's how it's always been.

Yours truly,
