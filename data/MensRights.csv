I live on the property of a private boat club, the property is gated, fenced, and has no trespassing signs all over. I live here to keep non-members out of the property as we are located on the water in a large park. 

Tonight I come home from work and do my walk around the property, as I do everyday, and I came across to young women sunbathing on one of the docks. I asked if they were members, they said no, and asked the to politely leave because this is private property. That's when they started to call me a perv, they can do what thay want, on and on. I am a very level headed person and let them rant and I calmly assed them to leave. They called 911 and screaming that some creepy old perv was harassing them. 

After a few minutes the police show up. Two female police. One goes and talks to the girls, the other talks to me. I explain to here that I live here and it is my job as caretaker to keep people from trespassing on the property. All the while the girls are getting all emotional with the other officer using words like creepy, they felt threatened, rape, the whole 9 yards. The 2 officers talk alone, then come over and cuff me risk me, take my wallet, phone, and keys, then seat me in the back of my car while they check my background and a warren search. All the while the two sunbathing girls are all giddy about me being in cuffs and taking my pic and text/posting like crazy. 

After about 15 minutes they take me out of the car and cuffs, and tell me I am free to go. (Go where? I fucking live here!) They then ask the girls, who are pissed that I was uncuffed, if they wanted to file a report against me, but they would have to leave the property. 

So for doing my job, on private property where I live, I end up in handcuffs for being considered ""creepy"" by doing my job. 

The officers never asked me if I wanted to file charges against them for trespassing.....of course. 

Update #1: I woke up this morning and my just venting on here blew up. I've replied to a few comments. I spoke to the board members of the club and we agree that in the future I should just call the non emergency number for the police and to record it. I also contacted a member who is a retired from the state supreme court and she told me ""that is utter bullshit"" as to how I was detained and she is putting a call into the police chief. I appreciate all the support, thank you!

Update #2: I recieved a phone call from the police departments internal affairs division today, they took a statement from me and are going to look into how the officers handled the call. I should hear something in a few weeks. I got the names of of the two girls who were tresspassing. So far I have not found any pics of me cuffed in the back of the car.

No more articles speaking on outlier women doing strange things.  This subreddit is turning more and more into a petty woman bashing forum every day.  

We can NOT allow this subreddit to degenerate into a copy of /r/feminism.    If you want mensrights to be taken seriously, hold yourself to a higher standard and pick your battles.  

We have REAL issues, family court, disregard of male rape, workplace deaths, etc.  But taking every chance you get to condemn random fucking women over the internet does NOTHING to solve it.

If you're here to solve these issues, stay.  If you're here to bash women, get the fuck out.

Edit:  Calling out major bigotry supported by the opposite sex is indeed necessary, but giving attention to freakish outliers is pathetic.  Go ahead, call out SRS, call out r/feminism, call out Jezebel every time that hatespeech drips from her lips.  Make the world aware of when bigotry is bigotry.  But when simpleminded idiots say absolutely radical bullshit, ignore it.  Don't give attention to the tiny tumblr blogs or the idiots on facebook.

Pick the battles that actually matter.  Strawmanning the opposite gender because of idiots who say things ""like all male opinions are invalid"" is petty though.  The majority of humans don't believe this, don't act like the opposite sex suddenly does believe that just because we're frustrated.

Edit:  It seems a large part of the community is looking for a shelter or somewhere to vent their frustrations.  Could someone better versed in reddit-fu make a /r/MensFrustrations for this kind of content?  Somewhere for men who have taken shit all day to sit down and vent and take the piss.

So first of all I'm in grade 9, in a University prep English course, from a small town in Ontario. I usually get pretty good grades and have never gotten an 0 on any assignment (that I've handed in) ever. Most of my essays have gotten 80s and 90s so far. 

So earlier this week we were supposed to write a short essay on any topic we were passionate about. I asked the teacher if it'd be appropriate to write an essay on rape (since, again, this is grade 9), and she said it was fine.

So I start writing. I wrote a fair, balanced essay on how men are treated unfairly in many aspects of Rape. I wrote a paragraph on false rape claims and how easily they ruin a man's life, I wrote one on how men are raped too but few people believe it happens and I wrote the last on how awful rape is in any form and how it would be beneficial to focus on prevention of all forms of rape instead of just man-on-woman. 

I tried my absolute best to write an essay that was fair to everyone. I didn't quote any statistics or ratios because I didn't even have them memorized but more importantly I didn't want the essay to come off as a numbers game. I just wanted to bring up an issue I felt was important.

So I hand in this essay proud of what I had written, confident that it was a good essay and hopeful that the teacher would learn something. 

I got it handed back today with a big fat ""0"" on it, and a note saying to see her after class.

I did, and she told me to write a new essay on a new topic because everything I wrote was untrue. I was furious and tried to calmly and rationally explain to her that, no, nothing I said was untrue, but she insisted it was. She then said she was doing me a favour by letting me re-write the essay on a different topic instead of just giving me a 0 for the assignment, and that if I kept this up that's exactly what she would do.

I thought about going to the Principle's after school but she's also a woman and I'm mortified that she might escalate this into something worse, like a suspension. 

So, is there anything I can do to fight this? Anybody I can contact about this?

[Link to Article](http://www.playereffort.com/?p=3884)

A millionaire woman is exploiting current gender issues (the whole ""women in programming"" business) to get enough money to send her daughter to RPG camp (where children learn to program). She aimed to raise just under a grand and has, so far, raised over $21k.

She's doing this because, supposedly, the girl's two brothers said ""she's a girl and therefore can't make games"". I suspect that, in actuality, it's just her millionaire mother wanting some $$$.

This is an exploitation of a minor, exploitation of current gender issues and a breach of multiple of Kickstarter's rules (it's both not a project and also charity).

Please report this Kickstarter for violation of either of these offenses.

Self posted so I don't get Karma, complete article below.

&gt; Susan Wilson, one of the “Most Powerful Women Entrepreneurs” according to CNN, is using Kickstarter to raise money for her 9 year old daughter’s schooling. The goal is $829, but Kickstarter users have pledged over $21,000.  This is borderline abuse of the Kickstarter system and the whole kicktstart makes use of the current rise of gender issues in video gaming, ‘Men VS. Women’ to populate it self .

&gt; The Kickstarter has made a ridiculous amount of money and it’s still racking in some. Luckily nobody has backed using $10,000 pledge *shudders* yet.

&gt; Pledge $10,000 or more

&gt; ROCK STAR REWARD LEVEL: At this level, you get everything from the previous levels plus a personal apology from her brothers and the satisfaction of knowing that you’ve not only started a career, you’ve also helped to fund future courses in computer programming for her along with more (and better) games!

&gt; Limited (5 of 5 remaining)

&gt; Estimated delivery: Jul 2013

&gt; Looking at the comments section of the Kickstarter, its clear backers are in favor of what Susan is doing – effectively taking advantage of them.

&gt; I hope Kickstarter looks into this and does something about it. While not clearly going against the rules, something as trite as a personal goal of sorts should be looked into, especially if it’s run by a millionaire. It’s pretty much the same thing as a somebody else asking for a $1000 for a new camera, or computer they need – it should not be done.

Found this very nice summary on the Kickstarter page, thank you Henrik:

&gt; Via reddit:
&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1awr1n/millionaire_using_kickstarter_to_send_her/

&gt; this is a hell of a lot shadier then it seems.

&gt; 1) She has her own female only crowd funding website so why is she using kickstarter?

&gt; Link: http://www.fundher.com/

&gt; 2) She has tried scamming kickstarter with a previous ""project"" which is pretty much the stupidest thing I've ever seen. She was asking for $20k . And I still haven't figured out what the ""project"" is about. Something about wearing towels as capes?

&gt; Here's a link to it http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/susanwilson/the-cape-project

&gt; Nonsense regarding the failed Kickstarter scam

&gt; Who hasn't wished they could fly? CUSTOM SUPERHERO CAPES! Personalized. Exquisitely crafted. Handmade by U.S. veteran family business.

&gt; OUR STORY

&gt; Our capes aren't quite bulletproof or indestructible, but they do withstand the harshest, unimaginative, closed minds on earth. No, your personalized cape won't allow you to jump tall buildings nor will it give you night vision. But it will allow you to defeat boring days and capture the imagination inside you. And what's more powerful than that?

&gt; 3) She's breaking the Kickstarter Spamming rule

&gt; Rule in question: http://i.imgur.com/yefoxge.png

&gt; Evidence of Spam: http://i.imgur.com/b4l2fI2.png

&gt; She's spamming celebrities like Lady Gaga &amp; The Ellen DeGeneres show. Why is she spamming celebrities and popular media just to raise $829?

&gt; 3a) Also evidence of breach of the ""Fund my life"" rule being broken:

&gt; Rule: http://i.imgur.com/6008aOd.png

&gt; Evidence: http://i.imgur.com/eUIagWv.png

&gt; 4) As stated by the O.P she's exploiting gender issues (feminism) such as the debate on women in STEM fields. She keeps referring to the RPG training camp as RPG STEM training camp. (Clearly milking the buzzword STEM)

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/di4Vrja.png

&gt; More exploitation of gender issues:

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/Y0yH2OK.png

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/F03oG3e.png

&gt; 5) The company that is running the RPG training camp, has an article on this Kickstarter. (Only trying to raise $829??)

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/djPAIKp.png

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/PiZT0yo.png

&gt; 6) If she only wanted to raise $829, why is she offering rewards for donating $10k ??

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/05CeXyu.png

&gt; 7) Portraying her sons as mean oppressors and throwing them under the bus to make a quick buck (Appeal to misandry)

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/ce2TENp.png

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/7xXuRbV.png

&gt; 8) Evidence of her questionable business ethics (Cybersquatting)

&gt; Evidence: http://i.imgur.com/jIduN8G.png

&gt; 9) Relevant articles from her blog, she seems to think mixing gender issues with crowd funding is a good way to make money, which explains her kickstarter, exploiting her children &amp; gender issues.

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/RmGlRn6.png

&gt; http://i.imgur.com/G25TKZN.png

&gt; Conclusion:

&gt; She's a scumbag, clearly has no ethics, is a cyber suqatter and a spammer, exploits her children, exploits gender issues &amp; appeals to misandry to make a few bucks.

&gt; Articles in the media about this, they obviously just printed the press release she gave them, without doing any investigating.

In the replies, [someone asks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/voors/what_the_hell_is_wrong_with_reddit/c56g8k8), ""Do you feel that calling someone a dick is misandry?""

[The answer: ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/comments/voors/what_the_hell_is_wrong_with_reddit/c56h0mu) ""No because the word dick doesn't have the same weight as bitch. It's like how calling a white person a cracker""

*That*, dear /r/feminism is what is wrong with reddit. *You* are what is wrong with reddit. You complain about things that affect everyone and then get mad when someone points out that they affect everyone - because you wanted to claim they only affect only women. There was once a headline in The Onion that said, ""Earth Destroyed by Giant Comet: women hurt most of all."" That's what you do, and people react negatively to it.

So you say, ""Issue A affects women"" and when someone responds, ""um, it affects men to"" you respond with ridicule: ""LOL WHAT ABOUT TEH MENZ AMIRITE!!!""

When offered examples of it affecting men, you respond with equivocation: ""No, that's different because it doesn't hurt men as much because reasons.""

And then you top it all off with hypocrisy. You claim that: ""no seriously, feminism is about equality. There's no need for a men's rights movement because feminism as that covered.""

That's what's wrong with reddit. That's why feminism is downvoted here. People have noticed that, and they're tired of it.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_vrn3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/vrn3h/to_rfeminism_heres_whats_wrong_with_reddit/,

There is not enough here about campaigning for men's rights or raising funds or serious organisation. Rather, /r/mensrights has just become a messageboard where everything is blamed on feminists. 

Listen, not every feminist is evil, but even if they were, we need to rise above it and push forward our own agenda without getting bogged down in the hate of others.

It's little wonder the MRM is seen as a group of whiny, bitchy little boys when there have been zero serious efforts to get organised and any time someone looks at this sub, there are more submissions about what's *wrong* with feminism, rather than what's *right* with the MRM.

It's embarrassing. Yes, feminism is (by and large) just a bunch of people infighting and shouting about things that don't matter... BUT, it wasn't always that way. Originally, at the beginning, feminism was a well-organised force for good (surely no one here can argue against that) and they still have that legacy which is why they get listened to. Their movement has lost its way. We need to take advantage of that. We cannot resort to their tactics and behaviours.

Until we can get our shit together, stop focusing on other people and BE MEN, we're never going to make the gains in society we need to.

EDIT: Sending me aggressive personal messages is unnecessary. Downvoting every comment I've ever made is silly.

Let me put some concerns to bed. I am not, nor have I ever been a feminist. I do not frequent SRS. I don't know how a good natured post encouraging us to be more grown-up in our approach could lead to that, but it's kinda proving my point.

I want us (men, women, even the Canadians) to be *better*. The hate messages I'm getting, the deliberate misinterpretation of what I said... That is not getting better. And please believe me when I say, this isn't (buzzword warning) 'shaming language' - it's reality.

We need to take what we have got more seriously if we stand a chance of improving the lives of men and boys everywhere. We can be a fucking army for good, but I see too much that is more akin to neighbours gossiping over a garden fence.

We can do this.

",burnerburner,1771,542,556,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15kbbz/never_told_anyone_this_need_to_get_it_off_my_chest/,"I'm a male. From ages 12 to 14 I was repeatedly raped by my step-sister.

It started immediately after my mother remarried. I got two older step sisters, but only one lived with us at a time. The oldest was 19, and we'll call her A.

She took the room next to mine and we shared a door. One night she whispered to me through the door that I should come to her room. 

When I got inside she locked the door and pinned me against the wall. I was a tiny kid at twelve, and I couldn't get loose. She started dancing on me, which had its obvious effect. I said, ""A, this is wrong, you can't do this,"" to which she replied, ""This is not A, this is Angel."" That was how the first time started.

The next morning I felt sick and couldn't eat. I wanted to tell my mom, but A came up to me and told me, ""You can't tell. If you ever tell, I'll tell them that you raped me. They'll believe me because you're a guy, and this is the south."" I believed her 100%. 

She took on the role of this character, and every night would either sneak into my room or call me into hers and molest me, or force me to perform acts on her. She refused to call me by my name and instead mad up a character for me. 

It wasn't limited to the night, either. At times when my family wasn't looking, or when we were coincidentally alone in the hallway, she would grab me or force me to touch her. I had to hide my erection in shame anytime she would do this behind their backs. 

Twice she invited friends over for a slumber party and called me into the room. There were two of them, and they joined her in molesting me and forcing me to perform acts on them. It was worse with them, as they would slap me, pinch my genitals, bite my lips and ears, and yank my hair. A, or ""Angel"", had convinced them that I liked it, and I was a ""submissive sex toy"". I guess they felt like they were doing me a favor and didn't see it for what it was. 

Eventually this became normal, and when she realized that I wasn't as ""guilty"" feeling about it she started bringing home boyfriends and fucking them loudly so I could hear. I would get so jealous, and she would tease me for it, and all I wanted to do was to kill both of them. After he left she would call me in to tell me about how much of a man he was and how I was nothing but a slave boy. 

The worst part for me was the emotional torment I experienced as my step sister took my virginity and forced me to become emotionally attached to her. I loved her, or at least the character she made of me did. 

I'm sorry if this was too graphic... I've been typing this story up for almost two decades, and deleting it every time. It's time for me to try to deal with this. 

**EDIT**: Thanks to everyone for all your support. Someone's cutting all the onions up in here right now. Thank you so much. 

**EDITEDIT**: A little more info by request. After I turned 14 my Mom divorced my step-dad. One day he just stopped talking to us and went off the deep end, and to this day I have no idea why. I always thought he saw me with Angel, or she told him, and he was going to kill us, or at least me. We eventually got out of there with the help of the Penelope House before anything got too far out of hand. I haven't seen her or heard from her in almost 20 years, since she got knocked up by a trailer park boy and went off to marry him. I don't even know her  last name right now, or what state she lives in.

And you're right, it is a joke, but it's things like this that define how the world sees a movement like ours.

I came to this subreddit hoping to find like minded people who would be interested in educating others, spreading the word, and sharing their experiences. There are many of those people here, but the majority of subscribers only seem interested in bashing feminists.

I'm not saying we shouldn't talk about things feminists do that threaten mens rights. I enjoy those posts. But posts like the one linked above add nothing to our movement, and discourage people who advocate for other movements from really listening to us.

This past Sunday I decided I would take my 5 year old sister to Six Flags. She's been a couple times and love talking about going again and riding the roller coasters and since I have a season pass, I figured I'd take her up for an afternoon. You have to understand, though, when I was eight I had a younger sister die- not at an amusement park, but still. So when this sister was born I sorta became overly protective. I would not live very long if anything happened to her. She's everything to me. So there is less than zero risk of me harming her in any way. Anyway, while we were in line for a ride I was tickling her and we were laughing when this lady walks up and kneels down. She doesn't even acknowledge me and asks my sister where her daddy is. And my sister says that he's at his house. She then asks my sister if she needs help or if she's scared. At this point I pick up my sister and tell her not to talk to strangers. The lady then starts asking me all sorts of questions about who my sister is and who I am and where I got her and what our relation is. I tell her, politely, that it's really none of her business and I would appreciate it if she would leave us alone. She said something about not trusting men and a man with a little girl shouldn't be left alone and that I could have kidnapped her. In the end, she left with a glare and my sister and I enjoyed the rest of our day. But it still infuriates me to think about it. She saw me with a little girl and assumed the worst because I was a guy! If she has seen a woman with a little boy, she wouldn't have thought twice about it. What does one do in that situation besides tell the person to beat it?

I can't afford a doctor, and I DEFINITELY cant afford a hospital bill if I go to ER.


I realized that if I was female, I'd be able to get the care I really need.

The healthcare act in the U.S gives every female citizen in America free heart screenings and a free annual doctors visit. Men don't get these services.

Feminists pushed very hard for this for women.

Did feminists propose making this service available to men, to? No, they didn't. 

Could imagine if the same situation existed in reverse?

When did MRAs EVER suggest a law or medical service that would benefit men only? 

I've found numerous free heart screenings, for women only...

Now seriously, could you imagine the public reaction to a ""free heart screening for men"" service offered by a public university?

I'm bascially being told ""I'm a male,  so I deserve to die. I don't deserve medical care to save y life because I'm a male.

Now, if I mention this, I become an MRA, which according to feminists makes me a sexist and misogynist, who hates women and is against equality.

So if I say ""I think males should have this service to, in case it could save their lives"", feminists say I'm a misogynist and I hate women. So because I DON 'T think people should be denied medical care due to their gender, I'm a sexist- according to feminists.

Feminists say that if you don't agree with denying men healthcare and letting them die, you are a sexist and hate women.

Some of you are too bitter to keep a rational discourse. No matter what is posted here, it's always offensive and grr and gah and all that jazz. For example, someone posted a feel-good story from  the Daily Mail about a wife saving her marriage simply by being nice. All of a sudden there's all sorts of ""gah what's wrong with society"" and ""what a bitch"" and all sorts of other negativity. 

She was NICE and was happy that the niceness was reciprocated!

This sort of thing is just an example, one of many, that shows that, perhaps due to our size, or perhaps due to something else, the MRM as it is on Reddit is getting more petty and infantile over time. Much like how the Womens Liberation movement was turned into Feminism by a large amount of crappy feel-gooders who didn't really understand the issues, this is the MRM turning into professional-victim central.

Someone made a joke about men? I don't care.

Someone made a form of social commentary and didn't consider your delicate feelings? I don't care.

I care about *REAL* issues, folks! Real ones! 

Someone who is not associated with the MRM was screwed over because he did socially unacceptable things? Is it a MR issue? If not, I don't CARE.

I made this thread because we need ideas. We need to find a way to get back on track, and I'd love to hear ideas. I have a friend who was falsely accused of rape, and he came to this subreddit after I told him about it, and he was excited before he came. Then he saw the content. He thinks this subreddit is full of pussies. Because of this, I propose we find a new way to handle this site.

[My comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/14z3is/merry_christmas_the_package_has_been_delivered/c7hv3pn) was also removed at the time.

As most of you will recall, a couple of months ago ShitRedditSays embarked on a campaign of intimidation and harassment against ViolentAcrez. I think [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/11ea2m/project_panda_va_outed_peaches_thawed_all_around/) was the original submission. Some argued that he brought it on himself (and perhaps he did). The issue was that the doxxing was allowed to continue. /r/ModTalk was up in arms, and eventually Yishan, Reddit CEO, stepped in to clarify the rules surrounding doxxing. [This](http://imgur.com/7oWt3) is a screenshot of the submission by Yishan. He clearly states:

&gt;1. We will ban doxxing posted to reddit.
&gt;2. We will ban links to pages elsewhere which are trivially or primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing (e.g. wikis or blogs primarily including dox).

&gt;**TL;DR: We stand for freedom of speech. We will uphold existing rules against posting dox on reddit. But the reality is those rules end at our platform, and we will respect journalism as a form of speech that we don’t ban. We believe further change can come only from example-setting.**

This, of course, caused outrage. It is an open invitation to doxx users on Reddit. We accepted it because free speech and practicality etc. Yishan's word is ultimately law. However, now we have an example of a similar case, only from the other side of this little gender studies battle. This time, however, the article is removed immediately. No pretense of free speech or removing instances of it being impractical. This time, ""there's no grey line here"". Now, apparently, the rules have changed again. So where exactly do the moderators stand? Why is [this](http://www.avoiceformen.com/feminism/happy-birthday-radfem-scthhum/) article banned, but [this](http://gawker.com/5950981/unmasking-reddits-violentacrez-the-biggest-troll-on-the-web) one allowed to remain? While one is certainly more verbose, they both represent the lowest form of ""investigative journalism"".

[This](http://i.imgur.com/8pUzR.png?1) is the conversation I've been having with bitcrunch so far. I am particularly concerned with the apparent unwillingness to give us any firm rules on this matter. Yishan made ""Reddit's"" stance very clear. I have explained that to bitcrunch, yet she seems to disagree with Yishan, only insofar as /r/MensRights is concerned. I wonder how many other subreddits and users this double standard applies to?

In other words, the admin, at their whim, may decide what is considered ""trivial"", or ""primarily intended for the purposes of doxxing"". Yet, inexplicably, the Gawker article did not fall under this definition. [Here's another example](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/15d5rg/big_red_high_school_football_team_raped_girl/).

I believe we have the smoking gun. This is an example of ShitRedditSays being allowed to continue a disgusting campaign of intimidation and harassment. When the other ""side"" returns fire, all links are instantly removed. This speaks to the very integrity of Yishan's statements. I contacted him two weeks ago requesting clarification and have had no reply. I have no other choice but to take this to the larger Reddit community.

1372189289.0,1086,self.MensRights,1h23bq,"""brainwash"" -- norwegian documentary examines how fields like sociology and feminist studies reject actual science because it doesn't fit with their ideology",toptrool,1476,390,369,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1h23bq/brainwash_norwegian_documentary_examines_how/,"[a quick background from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hjernevask).

you can watch the 7-part series [here](http://www.dailymotion.com/playlists/user/BrainwashingInNorway/1). (not safe for work: nudity)

each part is approximately 40 minutes long; i recommend watching #1 (gender equality paradox), #5 (sex), and #7 (nature or nurture) since they are most relevant to this subreddit.

#7 nature or nurture:

in this part, the interviewer interviews several social scientists, biologists, and medical experts in norway and elsewhere in the world. the social scientists want to push the idea that gender is a ""social construct,"" but the majority of biologists and medical experts soundly reject such ideas. the way the social scientists argue for their positions is both hilarious and frightening. a young baby boy (victor) was born with an undeveloped penis and doctors and surgeons removed the penis and then the boy was raised as a girl (victoria). victor was not happy with the feminine clothes he had to wear or the girly activities he participated in. victor (as a girl) had no idea that he was born a boy -- this is a counterexample to the theory that boys and girls are raised to fit into traditional gender roles. the ""gender researchers"" interviewed simply ignored his case. 

#5 sex:

despite feminists' insistence that culture shapes sexuality, researchers found that sexual desires are the same cross-culturally: men want more variation compared to women. women have evolved to desire less sexual partners due to the biological differences (pregnancy is more burdensome to women); women also want commitment from men as a result. men aren't as picky as women. 

when women were asked what they seek in relationships:

short-term: they wanted a man with a bad boy attitude, who has a tough and robust look, and good in bed.

long-term: a man who is considerate, a great personality, good provider, etc. 

evolutionary explanation: if it's going to be a short-term relationship, women will shop for the best genes rather than the best provider. 

they also go into genetic cuckoldry (""mama's baby, papa's maybe"") and how uncertainty of pregnancy affects male psychology. one of the most important things men look for in women for long-term relationships is faithfulness. women who have a lot of casual sex are rejected due to fears of infidelity.

Pretending that these issues are specific to one gender is extremely counterproductive, and furthers the idea that we must keep the genders separate in all activities.

Is it not possible for an act of domestic violence to be committed by a man's wife or girlfriend against him? Is it not possible for any individual, regardless of gender, to slip something in my drink? Should I not have knowledge on how to defend myself against rape?

Even if sexual assault does not technically count as rape, as [this piece](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/21/us-more-men-raped-than-women) points out (and we all agree that is a very serious matter), the United States is the only country in the history of the world to report more instances of male-male rape than male-female rape ([source](http://nplusonemag.com/raise-the-crime-rate)). It is astounding to me that the women who ran this completely feminine seminar would completely disregard the other half of a population that is clearly at risk.

Why would I not want to improve the image I project toward women? What exactly is the problem with me learning, among a group of similarly interested females, how to best act toward the opposite gender to make each party feel secure?

Perhaps I should not be, but I am appalled. I even tried to talk with the organizers in a reasoned tone and with legitimate reasons for wanting to attend, but I was physically blocked from entering. I do not visit this subreddit frequently, but I feel that this is something more people should be cognizant of. When faced with the choice between true equality and counterproductive isolation, female activists seem to choose the latter.

**EDIT:** I thought about asking if it would be possible to have a seminar for men only, and that might be in the works. I mean, think about it, how batshit crazy would women go if this type of thing was done to them?

**EDIT 2:** Because someone asked below, the organization that run the seminar was brought in by my public school, which receives government funding. I am not entirely sure whether this outside group is government-supported, however.

**IMPORTANT EDIT 3:** The organization that runs these seminars (called *PowerBack*) is named A Partnership for Change, which does these types of things in New Jersey, where I am. I will email one of the heads of the non-profit ***which is funded by the state of New Jersey***, and ask whether she would support a man attending as well. If she says no, well just another case of blatant sexism. If yes (which is what I assume she'll say), I'll be sure to write a letter to my school that includes her response.

Going to bury my brother..

My name is Sandy, and my brother Jerry committed suicicde a little
over a month ago. You all may know him as Black Visions. He posted to
this website sometimes as a supporter of men's rights. Jerry had a
fairly troubled past, and had been suicidial before those final few
days of his life. His ex-wife, who is the mother of his disabled 20
year old daugther, took a lot of his money for support and never let
Jerry see his daughter.

He wrote an email to me a couple of hours before he died. In the email
jerry said that ""I do not hate anyone. Why do they say I hate? I only
hate myself. They say that if ended my life, that it would be 1 down
and 30,000 to go. I feel very helpless."" He also called his ex-wife to
tell her that he was about to commit suicide, when she told him to
""fuck off and die already"" according to his emaIl. Jerry jumped to his
death from the 8th floor of a hotel in Washington State about an hour
later. He was 51 years old.

Our family has decided to take legal action not only against his
ex-wife, but those who urged him on to take his own life. Next week,
our lawyer will be filing a wrongful death suit in Washington State
against nine individuals. Our lawyer hired a private investigator and
three of the individuals have been identified from those who urged
Jerry to kill himself. Subpoenas will be issued to find the identiy of
the other three, though it is possible that they were the same people.
We don't know yet. We were told by our lawyer not to give any other
information out such as our full names or the people to be named in the lawsuit.

All money won from the lawsuit will go in trust to his daughter Sarah, who is now living in an assisted facility home in California. I wanted to
thank those on here who tried to reach out and attempt to help Jerry.
Your group meant a lot more to him than maybe you all realized. It was important to our family to let you all know what happened to Jerry, and to thank you for showing him friendship when others did not.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,1341609749.0,,,True,t3_s59ju,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/s59ju/from_the_sister_of_black_visions_who_committed/,

{EDIT}
I figured I'd introduce myself and give a short background to my story so you can understand what led up to the document and videos below.

My name is Josh.  I was divorced in 2006.  I have a 9 year old son.  I have BEEN THROUGH HELL.  In 2009 my ex wife filed a petition with the court suing me for 1) nearly 5 million dollars (which i don't have) 2) more child support (shocker) and 3) to strip my custody.  None of this was warranted and frankly, took me by surprise because we had been getting along relatively well, all things considered.  It turns out that she saw that I was growing my business and she wanted a piece of the action (3 years later).

In my state, NH, you can sue for a child support increase every three years.  With my son being only 5 years old at the time, I decided that because there were 13 years remaining until he turned 18, that I would defend this suit vigorously and not jump into a settlement.  If I settled, it would implant in her head the idea that whenever she wanted money, she could simply file suit and ""scared little Joshie will give me a bunch of money.""  Not the case.  However...

What followed was something that I never would have imagined in a MILLION years.  I was alerted to the ALL OUT fraud, corruption, deception, greed, lawlessness, and feminist entitlement-mindedness, of the family court - not to mention I would learn that the legal ""professionals,"" namely marital masters, guardians ad litem, lawyers, psychologists, therapists, and other ""amicus"" appointees of the court are completely incompetent, ignorant, and disregardful of the law.  Ever heard of the prepper phrase ""without the rule of law (WROL)""?  Well I invite you to tune into my story to come.

In short, a fraud suit was filed against me seeking millions, a false allegation was made against me resulting in the IMMEDIATE removal of all custody, visitation and contact with my son for 13 months, with ABSOLUTELY NO DUE PROCESS, and the burden was illegally shifted to me to prove why I should be able to get my son back.  The law was substantively broken by rogue judicial officers, my civil rights were denied, and my bank was broken.

I took matters into my own hands (legally), and decided to pursue a multi-pronged approach, which ultimately worked.  I will share all of the detail that I can with you and will help in whatever way I can - because I LIVED IT...I LIVED HELL.  I know how bad it hurts.  

Until we get into detail, I want to advise you to channel you anger, hatred, fear, loneliness, abandonment, stress, anxiety, sorrow, and pain into a commitment to learn everything you can so you can beat these organized criminals at their own game.

Just yesterday I asked my girlfriend to not treat me like her lap-dog. Which she does, when she's not treating me like a dog in general (Example, I washed her car, forget the bucket in her driveway, she called on the phone and demanded I ""get the fuck down here and pick this up"".)

So I explained my feelings to her and she told me I needed to grow some balls. I asked her to tell me what she thought that meant. She simply said ""be a man"". So, since the definition is so loose I made up my own definition.

I'm single now, I dropped off all her shit at her friend's place and after 3 years of emotional abuse it's been a long time coming. I'm looking forward to her calls just so I can tell her ""You told me to grow some balls. That's what I did.""

*edit* I neglected to mention the point of sharing this.  What I want to discuss is why ""grow some balls"" is the response to legitimate and supportable complaints.  Why do we say ""Oh you poor dear!"" to women no matter how petty or unprovable their claim, and men are told to ""grow some balls""  at the moment they actually start to display strength of will?

/r/violentacrez

So let me be clear about something. When SRS complains about the doxxing done by AgentOrange, it isn't that they are against doxxing. They have made it absolutely clear that they promote doxxing to get their way, they just don't want their own people doxxed. **Edit3:** After discussion with Manboobz he has assured me that he does not promote doxxing. I retract my statements that some have interpreted as meaning Manboobz had anything to do with this. I was associating him with SRS, who he (at least used to) be more prominently featured in. Information is still coming in about this event, and I will update this post as more accurate information is obtained.

r/MensRights is apparently next (see /r/violentacrez) on their list, which means they will be coming after me personally. The fact that r/MR is on their hit list as opposed to a large variety of other subreddits that actually do post things they are offended by can only be because of our repeated opposition to them. This furthers the idea that this isn't being done for moral or ethical reasons, this is being done for power/control reasons. We are about /r/incest, for example, on their list because we oppose them.

These people shelter the violent (see AgentOrange doxxing), the immoral (see AgentOrange doxxing) and the criminal (blackmailing is a criminal offense, so see /r/ShitRedditSays). They oppose the legal rights of individuals (though maybe immoral/unethical). These people represent a growing divide between those who want to see 1984 enacted and those who glorify the past days of rights and freedoms.

---

**Edit2:** The Admins have responded on the private Mod subreddits that they are looking into this and are taking it seriously.

---

**EDIT4:** More accurate information is posted here: http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/1190xz/mod_post_a_tribute_to_violentacrez_who_was_doxxed/

Note, it was Adrien Chen of Gawker media who doxxed ViolentAcrez. It was not SRS.

SRS is supposedly responsible for taking down r/Creepshots. They are responsible for doxxing and blackmailing there.

&gt;Finally, regarding [15] /r/Creepshots... yes, it has been shut down. One of the senior moderators received this message where members of [16] /r/ShitRedditSays (who had a campaign to shut down creepshots) had doxxed him and have been threatening to destroy his real life unless he shut-down the subreddit:

It came up that she had a boyfriend but she was still somewhat flirty. She seemed nice and after a while my roommate went to bed and we were alone. We'd been on the wine for a while and we were both pretty tipsy. Anyway we started making out and soon after she was sucking my dick. 

So yeah that was that, in the morning she knocks on my door and asks me not to tell my roommate or anyone else because as we live in an area near a uni campus, word gets around and she doesn't want her boyfriend to find out. I agree and promise not to tell anyone (I really wasn't going to).

Anyway two days later my roommate storms into my room and says ""what the fuck did you do you fucking piece of shit?"". Obviously I'm like wtf? She says ""you fucking raped her"". I'm at a loss for words, I'm like what? Who? What the fuck?

Anyway she keeps shouting at me and then I realise she's talking about her friend. I'm like ""what? who is saying that? No, she gave me a blowjob but that was consensual. I didn't say anything because she asked me not to because she didn't want her bf to find out"".

My roommate keeps swearing at me and demanding I leave. Anyway I call up the girl in question, she declines my call. Eventually after about an hour I get through and her boyfriend picks up. He says ""listen I'm going to fucking do you mate. you fucking raped my gf"". I said ""look I'm sorry to say this but she is lying, she sucked my dick but that is it"".. He says ""bullshit mate you're a fucking rapist"". I got quite angry at this point and said ""well if I'm a fucking rapist why did she suck it with enthusiasm and swallow my cum you dumb cuckold piece of shit? It's not my fault she got guilty and is making up shit to you so she can deal with the shame of cheating and you won't hate her"".

Admittedly this was a bit of a harsh thing to say but the guy was calling me a rapist, so I felt justified. He just says ""I'm coming for you you better watch your back"".

Anyway the very next day, my roommate isn't talking to me, I try telling her exactly what happened, tried being as adamant as possible, telling her to look me in the eye and tell me I'm a liar and a rapist. I think I got through to her a bit because she knows me quite well and knows I wouldn't do that, and also because I spoke to her with the conviction that only the truth can provide. I've spoken to her since and I think she believes me but can't say so because of the whole girl friends must agree with each other at all costs or they're guilty of massive betrayal sort of thing

Later that day when I was out I see the girl and I decide to confront her. I go up to her and say ""what is this fucking shit you've been telling people that I raped you? You sucked my dick and wanted to you fucking liar, tell the truth"". 

At this point she lays on the waterworks heavy. And starts shouting ""he's the one that raped me, it was him"". I get scared at this point because she is literally destroying my reputation and people are giving me the dirtiest looks imaginable and it could get quite hostile.. I start shouting ""she is a liar that cheated on her boyfriend and doesn't want to admit it, so she is saying I raped her. It is bullshit, she is lying""

At this point a group of guys come up to me and say ""you can't fucking say that about a girl"". I tell them its true, and ask them what they would do. The largest guy gets in my face and says ""you think you're tough raping a girl and then insulting her in public do you?""

He cheapshots me and they proceed to kick me in the face and beat me up whilst I'm on the ground. 

Anyway I get out with some painful bruises and a creaky jaw but nothing too major. I keep calling the girl to plead with her to tell the truth but she won't answer. Everywhere I go people are looking at me saying ""it's that fucking rapist"". I've had girls throw drinks at me and guys spit on me and kick my legs as I walk past. 

Anyway today she calls me and says ""I'm going to go to the police and get you sent to fucking prison unless you give me $1000. If you give me the money I'll just leave it and you can be known as the piece of shit weirdo around campus""

I tell her I don't have the money and she says that I have a week to get it before she calls the police and hangs up.

So what the fuck do I do here? Honestly with the way the courts are set up I would probably go to fucking prison wouldn't I? I can't go to fucking prison. I'm a average sized white guy and I wouldn't be able to defend myself if guys tried to rape me or beat me up. I would end up a fucking bitch. This really can't happen. 

Can I get my reputation back? Or is it the case that once this stuff is out there, even if its proven untrue, you can't escape people thinking you're a piece of shit?

What the fuck can I do here. I'm really worried. I'm thinking about paying her the money, but if I do, what's to stop her from asking for more? 

I'm in desperate need of advice. I don't know what her boyfriend is going to do and I'm in danger of being beaten up any time I leave the house. At this point everyone knows what I look like and they all give me filthy looks. I've tried talking to them and telling them its all a lie but they tell me I'm a rapist piece of shit. 

I fear that soon I will be arrested or viciously beaten up. I honestly don't know what to do. If I go to the police they will believe her. She will just fake cry and I will end up going to prison. What the fuck do I do?

False accusations are like a modern-day witch-hunt: any girl can cry ""he raped me"" and you're hauled off to prison to serve years for something you didn't do.

This will save you your criminal record, 15-100 years of your life, and possibly your life itself (prison can be a dangerous place).

So, you're falsely accused of rape/sexual assault/abuse etc, and the police have taken you to jail. You called your lawyer and now you're waiting for the cops to interrogate you. What's the number one tip?

DO NOT ACCEPT ANY PLEA BARGAINS.

DO NOT ADMIT TO ANYTHING YOU DIDN'T DO.

The police will tell you ""we already have proof you did it, just accept the plea bargain so you get a lesser sentence"".

Don't do it.


The police will tell you ""you realize you're going to be stuck in jail for longer than your actual prison sentence would be if you took this plea bargain, right?""

Don't do it.

They will intimidate you, lie to you saying they have evidence proving you guilty of a crime you didn't commit, etc. Don't plea bargain, don't admit to anything you didn't do.

They have to have concrete evidence to convict you. That's why they'd rather you accept a plea bargain. If there's no evidence that you did it, you walk free. No criminal record, no prison sentence, no life destroyed.

Also, if any feminist says ""false accusations are so rare that they hardly matter"" tell her ""ok, so if you were going to prison ten years for something you didn't do, would that hardly matter to you?""",,False,,t5_2qhk3,1366214201.0,,,True,t3_1cj4a5,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1cj4a5/if_you_get_falsely_accused_of_rape_do_this/,

Someone in the comments wanted to know whether I had asked the same thing over on r/feminism. What would they concede to the MRM? I thought that was a fair point, so I went over there, saw that they had a whole subreddit just for asking feminists stuff, so I did.

I attempted twice ( [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1he6c9/what_will_you_concede_to_the_mrm/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1hebz7/what_will_you_concede_to_the_mrm_ver2/) ) to do so.

I wasn't even aware this kind of thing could be done to a post. I sure as hell don't know how.

And now, after asking some questions at r/AskFeminism, they've banned me. Both subs. No explanation given. To the best of my knowledge I broke no rules.

So, congratulations MRM. Even though most of you defiantly refused my challenge/experiment/whatever, you nevertheless win because **at least you fucking allowed me to ask it.** I sure as hell prefer being insulted and downvoted, because at least that's direct.

1352306927.0,914,self.MensRights,12syiu,Why I support men's rights - my story,innocentman99,1151,237,479,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/12syiu/why_i_support_mens_rights_my_story/,"On December 27, 2011 I married the love of my life and the woman I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with, a teacher in Baltimore City.  After the wedding we moved into her apartment in Dundalk, MD and within a month purchased a house together. Everything was great.  We were in love, we were happy. Life was good.

Near the end of March 2012 we had our first real argument as a married couple - nothing major. It was about money, which all couples argue about.  Just a disagreement on how much money we were spending for repairs for our new house. However, a week later my wife told me that she didn’t want to be married anymore, that our marriage was a mistake. She asked me to move out, which I did. My parents live in WV, about two hours from Balimore. I decided to crash there for awhile while we (hopefully) worked things out.

Over the course of the next month and a half things got worse.  She went from wanting to work things out to not even wanting to talk to me. One day in mid-May I came home from work to find county policeman sitting in the driveway. He was there to serve me with a retraining order. I was heartbroken. I had given my wife no reason to do this. In fact, I was nothing but nice, helpful, and kind to my wife, still hoping to salvage at least part of our relationship. In my depressed state I decided not to fight the restraining order.  I hadn’t been back to MD in over a month. I would simply stop calling my wife and hope that she came to her senses.

Two weeks later in early June I had concert tickets in Baltimore. I decided to go in an effort to cheer myself up.  BIG mistake.  I had purchased the tickets months before when my wife and I were still living together.  She knew I was most likely going to be in Baltimore that night but I didn’t think about that.  When I arrived in the city I had some time to kill so I grabbed a bite to eat and stopped to get gas.  While pumping gas a Baltimore County policeman pulled up behind me. He told me that my wife had accused me of violating the restraining order by driving by her house (I hadn’t). I was arrested, booked, spent the night in jail, had my car towed ($250 impound fee) and was let out of jail on my on recognizance the next morning.  I was devastated.

Things get worse. The next Friday night (a week after my initial arrest) I’m at home in WV. It’s past 10:30 in the evening when police show up at my door.  They have a warrant for my arrest, stating that my wife said I violated the restraining order by sending her an email. The arresting officer asked if my wife was mentally unstable because evidently she had called and harrassed the local police until they were “forced” to arrest me.  Evidently she was calling every hour and working her way up the chain of command. Essentially the officer told me that they were arresting me to shut her up. Again, I was arrested, booked and released on my own recognizance the next morning. 

I now had to misdemeanor cases in two different states, both for violating the restraining order. I had proof that I didn’t commit either crime so I wasn’t worried about the case.

In early July the WV police showed up once again.  This time they had a warrant for violating the restraining order (my wife alleged emails again), credit card fraud (my wife said I opened a CC in her name, which I didn’t), and computer fraud (related to the CC fraud).  I was arrested, booked, and held on $10K cash bond.  My parents hired the best attorney in our part of WV to defend me.  In our initial meeting he took one look at the charges and laughed.  The arresting officer hadn’t even read the definition of “computer fraud” correctly.  He was confident that everything would be thrown out of court but he still had to work on getting me affordable bail. Eventually he did but I ended up spending two weeks in a WV jail while waiting for my bail hearing.

Keep in mind that I had never, ever been in “trouble”  with the law before this. Not so much as a speeding ticket in the last 5 years.  Nothing.

The day after I made bail in WV I had to appear in court in MD for my misdemeanor arrest there. Since I had been in jail I planned to go to court to ask for a continuance.  I did. However, as I was leaving the court room a police officer approached me with four different arrest warrants.  Evidently shortly after the restraining order went into effect my wife said that I sent her emails.  I had not but that didn’t matter.  The courts will believe anything a female says.  I was arrested again and later that night a commissioner set my bail at $250K.  

The next day I had a bail hearing and was using a public defender because I had not had time to hire a “real” lawyer.  He was confident that given the charges (violation of restraining order by sending emails) my bail would be greatly reduced or I would be let out on my own recognizance. He was wrong.  The FEMALE judge took away my bail.  It looked like I was going to sit in jail until my trial. 

This was an awful situation, as Baltimore jail is no place that anyone wants to be. My public defender arranged for another bail hearing a week later in a higher court.  He was confident that my bail would be reinstated and reduced.  It wasn’t. My bail went from “no bail” to $1 million bail. Yes, ONE MILLION DOLLARS.  At that point my parents (out of their own pocket - I was broke by now) hired the best attorney in Baltimore County to defend me.  Again, he took a look at the charges and laughed.  He was amazed that I was even arrested, let alone in jail with a huge bail.

After spending one month in jail my trial date arrived. Prior to the trail my lawyer went into judges chambers with the state’s attorney. Everyone agreed to drop all charges against me except for one. I would be given a suspended sentence and probation before judgement.  Everything would be wiped from my record as if the arrests never happened. There was no evidence - my wife couldn’t produce any of the emails I supposedly sent.  The one charge that stood was the one where she accused me of driving by the house. My lawyer told me that the FEMALE judge in my case called my wife “criminally involved” and suggested that the prosecuting attorney’s office look into charging her with filing false reports.  In the courtroom things went smoothly and my wife was allowed to make a statement, which the judge ignored.  My wife was furious that I (totally innocent) was being released.  She made an ass of herself by yelling at the prosecuting attorney.  Meanwhile the judge was basically apologizing for me for my ordeal.  

A week later I faced a preliminary hearing in WV.  Again my wife was there but there was never any hearing.  Evidently the WV state’s attorney had finally taken a look at the case and realized that there was no evidence.  The whole thing was made up.  All charges against me were dismissed.

I had won the war with my crazy soon to be ex-wife but at what cost?  6 weeks total spent in jail. $7000 in attorney fees. $1500 in bail money.  I lost my job. I lost some of my friends.  I’m financially and emotionally devastated.  Sure, the upcoming civil suits I’m filing against my wife will help me financially but I’ll never get back the 6 weeks I lost and I’ll never really trust anyone again. She said she loved me and maybe she did.  I’ll never really know what went wrong.

Why did all of this happen?  Well, in WV and in MD you can apply for a restraining order with very little evidence.  Judges would rather be safe than sorry and issue restraining orders without cause than not issue them and something happen. Likewise, in both states you can apply for an arrest warrant against someone for violating the restraining order without the police ever being involved.  You can go down to your local court house, fill out a statement and a commissioner or magistrate (who aren’t judges and don’t have formal legal training) can sign off on the arrest warrants.  That’s what happened to me. My wife made shit up, wrote out a statement, and some mid-level government drone signed it.  I was arrested.  It wasn’t until much later as my cases worked their way through the system that someone with formal legal training (and an ounce of intelligence) realized that it was all bullshit.

I used to fully support women’s rights and in some respects I still do. However, if the situation had been reversed and if I would have tried to pull this stunt on my wife I’m confident that no warrants would have ever been issued.  In fact, I’m sure that any police involved would have told me to “grow a set” and move on.  

It’s a double standard and we need to fix that.

Divorced, she initiated. Lost custody due to lies about me being abusive and violent with the mother. Fraudulent restraining order used as evidence in family court.

Heard from the neighbors she told him things like ""you're never going to see your father again, because he's violent and hateful"" in a state of agitation.

She's a feminist too and god knows what she's been drilling into his head. With the things they say.

Was going to try to get custody again, but couldn't afford a good lawyer. Divorce, go figure. Intolerable to not see my son for so long. After about year, today, it got too much for my son.

I feel like society took my son away from me. Killed by his mother, a feminist, enabled by Feminism.

Last night I was in line for a bar and was having a conversation with my friends, these girls who are standing behind us who are also in on the conversation decided to sneak ahead of us and continue the conversation. 
*""Excuse me, you're just gonna cut us?""* I said
*""Oh, come on. You're not going to let us?""* she replied
*""No, because we were here first, why should you just get to cut us?""* 
*""Be a gentlemen""* 
*""I'll open a door for you sure but I'm not gonna let you take my spot""*

This went on for a minute and went we get to the door I just pushed my way ahead of them and showed my ID and walked in. Sorry, I just cant allow that, still that wouldn't be the only time that night. While in line for another bar that my friends dad owns another group of girls walk behind us and smile and go ""Excuse me"" before we react there cutting us and standing in front of us
*""You guys drunk or something!?""* my friend shouts ""You just fucking cut us"" 
*""Hey chill bro, were girls""* one replies
*""Yeah but that doesn't mean you can cut us, it just means you have vaginas. Get in the back of the line yo""* I replied
*""Yeah were not gonna, so chill out before we call security""* one them responded

Now at this time the guys in line ahead us are noticing that they're about to be cut the same group of girls. One of them politely puts his hand of the wall and blocks their path. 

*""Hey can we get by?""* the first girl said
*""No, but you can go to the back where you belong""* he says smiling
*""If you don't move, were just gonna push you out the way""* she says smiling back
*""Not gonna happen babe""* The guy says as his smile turned into a serious face and turn away from her
The girl looks back at her friends disgusted and they all duck and try to go under his arm and he simply blocks them with his body. The apparent leader whose stopped first tilts her head back and I kid you not shouts this in a sort of laughing manner *""RAAAAAaaaPE""*

The guy blocking their way is freaked out and steps back from them and they laugh and walk past him to the door. The actually get in and I never seen them again. Why and how can this happen and guys don't do anything to stop it? Why is it the girls who were actually waiting in line try not to stop them except my friends and that one bold gentlemen ahead of us? Why do clubs and bars allow this?

Obviously if the mother didn't want the child, and the father did, she could easily abort it without his consent. It's her body, and I think it should be her decision to go through with it for either adoption by the father or adoption by a third party, but as far as keeping it, it just doesn't seem logical men should have to pay half of their paycheck for two decades because of someone else's decision, despite the man's efforts to forfeit financial responsibility before it comes a burden.

After a few messages were shared back and forth, I found myself with a meeting scheduled for what is now last week.

I went in and, luckily enough for me, they both were extremely reasonable. I got a slight feminist vibe from one of them, but it wasn't on-par with the feminists you see on reddit. She was actually sane.

But we managed to talk about a handful of issues, ranging from the Women's Center being too exclusive with their services, to how certain programs on campus (e.g. Take Back the Night) need to be expanded to raise awareness that rape and domestic abuse aren't strictly man -&gt; woman, but also woman -&gt; man, woman -&gt; woman, and man -&gt;man.

After a thirty-minute meeting, it was decided that they'd try to bring me in on certain things to help and give feedback, that I should email them if I think of anything that would help drive said efforts forward, and that, as I said in the title, the Women's Center will be renamed to the Student's Resource Center for Men and Women.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_1alw6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1alw6w/my_uni_is_probably_changing_the_womens_center_on/,

This was as a result of a 'journalist' seeking out his personal information and threatening to publish it, which would have a significant impact on his life. 

Adrian Chen has engaged in an active pursuit to harrass and, allegedly, blackmail reddit moderators with public release of photos and personal information, and has also been implicated in posting large-scale hoaxes and attacks against reddit as a whole.

As moderators, we feel that this type of behavior is completely intolerable. We volunteer our time on Reddit to make it a better place for the users, and should not be harassed and threatened outside of reddit for that. We should all be afraid of the threat of having our personal information investigated and spread around the internet if someone disagrees with you. Reddit prides itself on having a subreddit for everything, and no matter how much anyone may disapprove of what another user subscribes to, that is never a reason to threaten them.

As a result, the moderators of /r/mensrights have chosen to disallow links from the Gawker/Jezebel network until action is taken to correct this serious lack of ethics and integrity. We thank you for your understanding.

They're obvious, but some people (women) just don't see them.

I recently got into an argument with my SO... one of the first actually. I was upset and talking loudly, sometimes yelling, sulking, and slamming things around to get my point across. I hit a nerve and he began yelling, the same way I was, and went to our room and slammed the door. This literally scared the shit out of me (he's never done anything like that), but mostly just broke my heart. 

I left for a little while and thought about what happened. I was so angry. How could he treat me that way? That was horrible when he slammed the door. Soon after the argument began, it was resolved and everything was okay.

Weeks after this incident, I got to thinking. How does my SO handle it like a champ when I'm walking around bitching and getting loud, banging things around like a monkey, yet if he pipes up a bit louder than normal... I feel like I'm getting beaten down. 
It's ridiculous. 

It's not okay for women to do these things and then over react when a man does the same thing. I realized that I was not respecting my SO the way that I should. It's about treating him the way I wish to be treated and not thinking that because I'm a woman, I have the right to be more aggressive.

But today was a different story. 

I recently joined a sort of bonus program offered by the nursing college that allows us to get a little extra experience by joining a group that goes to the local hospital and shadows nurses doing their daily routine. I'm the only male in the group, and before this had never been a problem. Today we were going to the birthing suits to shadow the OB nurses there. Now I got to watch ultrasounds, infant care, etc no problems, but while we were there a mother went into labor and consented to us observing the child being born.

We're about to go into the room when one of our ""tour guides"", for lack of a better term, pulls me aside and says ""I think you should sit this one out, the mother might be uncomfortable with a man in the room viewing this."" I was floored by this. I pretty much assumed that when the mother in question consented they told her that there was a male student there as well. I responded with ""Well do you mind if I at least ASK the woman if I can come in? I'd rather not miss something like this."" To which she replied ""Listen, you'll be going over this when you're in training, I think it's best if you stay outside, this sort of thing requires a more feminine touch.""

At this point it's all I can do to stop from yelling at this woman. I told her, as calmly as I could, that would inform her supervisors if she didn't at least let me ask if the mother would permit me to view the birth. She visibly pissed at this but let me go in and ask, and the mother told me she was perfectly fine with me being in there (her actual words were ""Hell, bring a camera if you want,"" which calmed me down a bit). After we finished for the day I called the programs administration office and filed the complaint anyway. I also took the liberty of warning the few other male nursing students I know to watch out for the lady.

I can honestly say that this was the first time in my life I've ever felt discrimination on anything, let alone because of the fact that some of my organs dangle. I just kept asking myself if it would get worse than this. It may sound mild but I was extremely offended by this and I felt it necessary to share.

EDIT: A couple people have mentioned that the mother was in a somewhat unfit state to be making a judgement about whether or not I should have been in the room. I'd just like to inform you that this woman was doing a crossword up until the doctor came in and told her she was in labor.

Like, I would go to conventions and parades for this shit. I would become president to get the message across if I had to. But for now, y'know, I'll just scoot on in here and say a few words.

One thing I'm strongly against is believing that just because a woman carried a child and possess the ability to do so, she is the better parent. Men are just as capable of taking care of a child as a woman is. Hell, I'll proudly admit I'm a ""daddy's girl"" and that man is my hero. He fought for custody of me most of my life and if the court would have seen that he was, in fact, a better parent than my mother, I would not have grown up in a drug-filled, abusive environment. He does without to give me the world while my mother chose to neglect my younger disabled brother and I for drugs and shit. He helped make the child, he should stand a chance. They should *always* have a fighting chance and a say-so just as much as the mother. Fathers are some of the most kindhearted people I've ever met. 

Also, I think that shaming a man's sexuality/sexual needs is wrong. My boyfriend was brought up to think in such a way and is now very ashamed anytime he comes onto me/wants to have sex/do something sexual/talks about sex. I'm trying to break him of that but, my god, it's hard. I don't begrudge him for that, although I do want to take a bat to the face of those who instilled that shame in him. A woman's sexuality is seen as beautiful and wonderful and just full of butterflies and yummy goodness while anytime a man even looks at a woman, he's attacked. Men are human too and have needs. They have a right to fantasize, look, make a pass, ask for sex, whatever they wanna do. That should be flattering, not considered ""rape"" of any kind.

And men being ""feminine"" shouldn't be a crime either. My boyfriend's feminine and I fucking love it. That man will squeal when he sees puppies or kittens and talk in a high-pitched baby voice. He likes to clean and smell nice. He likes to snuggle and cuddle and acts/talks cute to the point where we both become vomit-worthy, and he cries at sad things and isn't ashamed to. Men who do that or anything else considered ""feminine"" shouldn't be seen as any less of a man. Hell, it should make them *more* of a man for breaking out of the stereotypical ""macho-tough-guy"" mold. 

(Do I even need to add stuff about how feminists are against/hateful towards trans-women, claiming that they're only claiming such to like, get into girls' locker rooms shit and other perverted bullshittery? How fucked up is that?)

It confounds me how people think that women are the only ones oppressed. I was always against anything that had to do with feminism because of how extreme and, IMO, absurd it can be. Like it literally makes my brain hurt to try and wrap my mind around that shit. It's yucky.

I love my boyfriend and hope that one day he, as well as all men, won't be seen as predators or perverts or whatever the hell they're being called now. They'll be seen as men. Cause men are nice. Ya'll hold doors open and take the bill. And sometimes ya'll smell nice. And that's pretty neat.

Well, I think I've rambled enough? I hope this makes sense. Ask any questions you want, do whatever. Just wanted to shove myself behind the cause and shit.

I engaged Eve Thomas yesterday when I found that she was gathering abuse testimonies for a book. She said she was looking specifically for (additional) testimonies from male victims.  When I offered to extend her request here, she said ""that'd be awesome!""

the convo is screen-captured here http://imgur.com/a/ZT9oq

My assumption is that she'll link submission requirements in response [here](https://twitter.com/mensrightsrdt/status/324556294625296384)

how to make submissions: http://m.evethomas.co.uk/-OneVoice-Survivors-Book.html

From her twitter profile:



&gt;Author of The Eyes and Choices-The Darker Years. Women's Aid will receive a % from every sale of Choices. #worldpeaceday #onevoice, DV campaigner and mum. X

&gt;Bolton, England · evethomas.co.uk 

Proceeds from her book will support several charities - one of which is Ark of Hope, who is gender neutral in their advocacy.

eta notes sent via tweet:

 thank you so much. I've read the link and I feel I need to explain. I'm a survivor of #DomesticViolence and

writing helped me to escape from the world I was living in. Amy's pain is my pain and although

fiction every emotion and feeling is poured into it. I became free and wanted to help other and so

 I created the #onevoice projects. The first is #DomesticViolence / #domesticabuse and there are

50 chapters, 50 individual true stories all with a common theme DV/DA. Males as well as females

have submitted stories and each have said how writing and sharing has helped on their journey as

survivors and so as I get ready to publish I wonder how I can do more to help others and so

#onevoice is unfurling it's wings with a book on child abuse, sexual assault and the latest to help

soldiers suffering from PTSD. All revenue will be split equally and each author nominated a charity

it's a win win situation! I extend the offer of friendship and guidance and an outlet for your

voices and charities that you nominate benefit. I want to help as many abuse victims as I can and

everything I do I do for #worldpeaceday THE day to raise awareness for ALL #abuse I hope this

helps clarify everything. My sole wish is to help others and ease suffering and pain. Eve x

and it's EQUAL for men and women! Zero tolerance for discrimination! My own books yes I donate a

 percentage to women's charities but these are charities personal to me who helped me. Eve x

and share your story and YOU nominate the charity so YES MEN, GOOD MEN ARE VERY MUCH WANTED! X

1353474676.0,831,self.MensRights,13jvg4,"Thank you, MensRights. You've made me a better girlfriend.",jethro_skull,1065,234,186,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/13jvg4/thank_you_mensrights_youve_made_me_a_better/,"I just wanted to say thanks. I've been lurking for almost a year now, and posting sporadically since I created my account a few months (?) ago. I can't even describe how much just reading things from a different perspective has changed me, after being indoctrinated by the public with the Feminist perspective. I go to a womens' college, and though my views aren't popular, I am able to fight against the horrible, misandric things many of my classmates claim.

But the real reason for this post is to point out the things I've learned about *being in a relationship* from you.

* Nobody is entitled to anything in a relationship. That means not only is my partner not entitled to my body, but I'm not entitled to his. I'm not entitled to any particular treatment from him- and who wants to be put on a pedestal anyway?  I can be at fault for making the relationship difficult; he doesn't have to kiss the ground I walk on. Knowing this, I'm far more satisfied with my relationships- not only because I don't expect shit like that, but also because when he does feel like surprising me- with flowers, or a back massage, what have you, it feels even better because I don't ask for it.

* He has feelings, too. Though men tend to be a little more introverted with expressing their emotions,  those emotions are still there. Especially feelings of insecurity. Men are insecure about similar things that women are insecure about, and a lot of things we don't even know happen. I've started really trying to get in touch with my SO's feelings, listening to him, and reminding him that he's special to me. Complimenting my SO has made our relationship a lot happier, and he loves to show his appreciation for the fact that I *listen*. By giving him the treatment he secretly wants, I get the treatment I want. It's completely reciprocal, and so easy.

* Like I said before, men have insecurities, too. I think this one deserves its own bullet point, because so many women overlook that fact and act like their SO is just being a baby when he expresses genuine insecurities or concern.

*  Society really isn't fair to ANYONE. There are two sides of a coin. Sure, there are a lot of things that I am unsatisfied with in society, as a woman. But there are a lot of ways in which society treats men just as awfully. Being able to bond and discuss these societal gender differences really facilitates understanding between us.

I think what it all comes down to is that MensRights has opened my mind. I've become a better listener, and stopped looking at men as the enemy.

So, thanks, guys. My current relationship is the best I've ever had, and it's all because you gave me the tools to look at myself and how I relate to other people. I wish more women would try to see it this way, because I'm honestly happier than I've ever been with somebody else.

I'm a musician and **I have non-marital savings**. I play local gigs, paying under $10k/yr. But I've always paid all the bills, house is paid for; we  lived comfortably.

Now, just because I've done a few websites, my wife's lawyer is 'imputing' my income at $80,000/yr. for child support purposes. Not only that, I have to pay for my wife's lawyer. Her current bill is $13,000, and we've only reached the first hearing.

Worst of all, my own lawyer tends to agree with hers, and I've even consulted other lawyers who all say basically, ""You're screwed.""

I have no college credits, Microsoft or other certification, and no formal training in graphics or web design. I've made less than $5k in over ten years of web design and 1/3 of my former clients are now doing their own sites. I've made over ten times that playing music, but that doesn't count for imputing income because it doesn't show up in the Bureau of Labor Statistics salary estimates. 

Wife's lawyer is even hiring a 'vocational assessments expert' to bolster their claims, and I'll have to pay for this asshole, too... just because I can and my wife can't. She's a preschool teacher making $40k/yr. Any thoughts?

**Edit:** 1) Thanks for all of the responses; many have been very helpful. 2) My nonmarital savings are approx $1.6m at this time, current market value, far less if liquidated. 3) If my income were imputed at 80k, it might triple my support obligation. It would be unfair, but I could afford it, and it's not worth leaving the country (or my son) over. 

Sorry if original post was misleading regarding my savings, but they really have nothing to do with what I can or cannot earn in today's job market.

As the title says, two women went to the police after they were 'stalked' at night by two men whilst walking home. The e-mail makes it clear that the men never did anything other than walk behind the women from a slight distance. The men never touched them or verbally harassed them. I can't help but think that these two poor men who were just walking home or going to meet friends will be returning to e-mails describing them as potential stalkers and predators - and yes, the e-mail did describe the clothes and build of one of them.

I'd like to do the gender reversal test here. If a man went to the police 'looking shaken' because a woman had walked behind him at night without doing anything, would they take it seriously? No. They sure as hell wouldn't send out a mass e-mail to everyone living in the area. They'd tell you to get out of the station and stop wasting police time.

EDIT: At the request of MikeVoldemort, here's the text of the e-mail. I've removed any identifying details, phone numbers, etc. I left their typos in, though.

Dear Students,
 
I have been passed the following message from &lt;Location name here&gt; Police regarding a couple of suspicious incidents which have occurred recently. Whilst there was no contact made by the male follower, it is obvious that the two girls involved felt sufficiently unnerved to report the matter.
 
We are fortunate to experince such events relatively infrequently, however, these incidents are a very timely reminder for us all to remember our personal safety at all times and the advice contained in the message is quite appropriate. I am, therefore, making this information available to all students in the hope that you will take notice of this advice wherever you are living. If you have experienced any similar incident locally or have relevant information then please report it to &lt;Location name here&gt; Police - Telephone &lt;removed&gt;. 

Thank you for your attention and stay safe.
&lt;Name and telephone numbers removed&gt;

Dear student,

I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on two incidents that happened on Monday (15 October) which we are treating as suspicious and to provide you with some advice on what you can do to keep safe.

The first incident involved a 17-year-old female student from &lt;College here&gt; who was followed by a man as she walked along &lt;Road name&gt; on her own at around 5.10pm.

The second involved a &lt;University here&gt; student in her late 20s who was followed by a man as she walked along &lt;Road name&gt; at around 9.10pm.  

Neither woman was harmed but both were left shaken. On both occasions the man’s intentions are unknown.

Officers are investigating both reports and it is believed they may be linked.

The man is described as being white, aged early to mid 20s, 5ft 10ins tall with a slim build and had short dark hair. He wore a navy hoody/jumper and dark trousers.

Students are advised to follow the below tips on staying safe:

·        if you suspect you are being followed, go to a public place and ring a friend to meet you or call the police on 999 
·        walk confidently and be aware of what’s going on around you. Looking drunk or lost can make you an easy target. Try to blend in 
·        your hearing is your best defence. If you are on the phone or listening to music, you won’t hear someone approach 
·        if instinct tells you there may be trouble - never ignore it. Go somewhere safe 
·        have your house keys ready in your hand before you reach home

After being negative cash flow for a year after separation.  The court takes 60% of my net wages, without any notification (I got a call from my employer).  Shortly after I become homeless, and cannot afford to maintain the computer equipment I need to do my job.  Shortly after that I lose my job (The company shut down).  

By the time I make it to trial, I am financially destitute, cannot even obtain unemployment (because of work done out of state).  I can't afford an attorney and have to stand tall, ""In Pro Per"".  Just before the trial my ex took a vacation to the Bahamas.  I had to get a ride from a friend to make it to the trial (had to sell my car to pay attorney fees).  I cited the case of Alan S. at the beginning of the trial and asked for a continuance until I could get a job and get an attorney and was told by the Judge ""That ship has sailed"".  The judgement overlook several laws I cited regarding equal representation. 

To top it off, the Judge and opposing council took a recess during the trial so that they could meet (without telling me).  The Judge interviewed opposing council for a Job on the bench, and shortly after the trial I got a letter saying they had made my ex's attorney a court commissioner.  They award my ex,  over $1000 a month in Spousal support, for the rest of her life, when she has a $60,000 a year job and I am homeless and unemployed.  Because I was without attorney, I was run over roughshod by the court, my evidence ignored, multiple laws ignored.  

I was forced to go to court without an attorney against my will, when my ex had the best attorney in town, who was apparently in the Bro-Bra of the local court.  Currently I am appealing the trial based on the meeting of the Judge and Opposing council during the trial.  So far I've lost in the neighborhood of $250,000 in money stolen from community funds by my ex, lost income and attorney's fees, not to mention the fact that my previously good credit has been completely destroyed. 

 All I can afford at this point is a second rate attorney and  I'm not sure where to turn, or what to do.  This has been doing on for 5 years.  If anyone cares to have a look at the case (I'm still trying to get complete copies of all the court documents in the case), It's in Truckee, California Superior Court, case T009354FL.  All the evidence, statements, cited laws, etc. are filed with the court.

  At the end of the day, I just want my ex to go away. I'm trying to help my two children (now adults) get through college.  My ex has become estranged from both of the children.  

She stuck my son with a $10,000 student loan and kept the money.  She also lied to my daughter and told her she was required by state law to attend high school full time, after she turned 18, so that my ex could continue to collect child support for another year.  As soon as child support ended, my ex rented out my daughters room and kicked her out.

Me and my children have been exploited by this monster who abused the entire family for years, lied to me, lied to the children and lied to the courts.

I would be interested in any advice, support, well wishes, or anything else of assistance that can be sent my way.  I knew the courts were bad, but I had no idea.

EDIT BY OP. The case number above was incorrect. The correct case is T09/3354FL. I'm kind of chuckling because I see people even went as far as to call the court. There are two nice ladies that work there that are the only court clerks, so I can just see a bunch of people calling about the case, and them going like WTF? :) . Also the people that looked on-line were looking at a court schedule. My case is done, it's no longer in Truckee Court, I have to go to the court of appeals now, which is not in Truckee. Also even when I did have hearing there, my case never did show up on that page because their site and their computer system in short, suck. The case has been sent for appeal, but no date has yet been set, I was told that they have to first decide if the case should go to mediation or if it's going all the way for appeal. That's about where it stands.

I also have copies of various documents, I could post online after scratching out names, etc. But at the end of the day, I was just seeking a little advice and direction from people that had perhaps been there before, had the name of a good attorney or just some encouraging words. I'll check back in from time to time, but, the good news is,  I also have a life and a job, and this got way more response than I expected. I've tried to respond to as many questions as I could in the thread, and will get to more as soon as I can.

I'll also add the following disclaimer, that these are my allegations against my ex, and I have not yet proven them in court.  I am seeking an appeal to get a new trial so I can have an attorney present my evidence to the court.  The evidence supporting my allegations are on file under the case number above, so I'll let the evidence speak for itself.

As a last note, I have been working now for some time and I am no longer homeless (thanks to working).  And As a last, last note, I just want to say thanks for the well wishes and please ask that people refrain from any kind of negative or aggressive types of posts, please keep it constructive and cordial :)

EDIT #2 BY OP
I filed for the Appeal for a new trial,  and got a Settlement offer from My Ex's attorney.  Everything gets zeroed, I give her $5k and she goes away w/ no spousal support, nada, anything I owe, zeroed, and vice versa.  Talking w/ my attorney about it now.

Been treated as if I was a paedophile.,Galactic-Unicorn,951,178,208,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z91i6/i_can_barely_contain_my_rage_been_treated_as_if_i/,"I am a volunteer medic for an organisation I'll not name for anonymity. Today my (male) colleague (we'll call him D) and I responded to a hurt child in a play park. He was with friends, but no parents. The injuries were not drastically severe, but stitches were needed up at hospital so we carry him into the ambulance on our trolley bed and thank the child safety officer for her ""assistance"". 

*These child safety officers are a ""professional, uniformed service"" to ensure child safety at local parks and play centres.*

At this point she tells us that she is coming with us to hospital. This is an absolute no-no for us as she in not a legal guardian and has no right to this child's personal details and patient confidentiality is crystal clear that she can not come. 

Once in the ambulance we called the father and explained the plan of action. He said he'd meet us at the hospital rather than delay us in getting there by picking him up. Boy was happy and spoke to dad on phone. Everyone happy. Except the child safety officer who began insisting that she had to come with us to make sure the child was safe.

Now, I was police checked, so was my colleague. He has been at this for 18 years, myself for 4. Taking a kid to hospital for stitches is not something we can screw up.

Patient confidentiality was explained and permission denied. She then climbs into our ambulance and says that she is coming, end of story and threatens to call the police. D and myself forcibly remove her and threaten to call the police on her. After she is out we close the doors and D gets us moving before she can do anything.

After the patient was safely dropped off we debriefed with an officer and filed paperwork. In the last 2 months since the introduction of the child safety officers this is the 4th identical incident. Two professional crews (both male) and now us a second volunteer crew (both male) had this exact issue. Interestingly the female/male team that took a similar call a few days ago had no problems. The female colleagues I spoke to also had no problems in this area. I then spoke to my officer again and highlighted the gender bias. 

It was already known that these incidents occurred as we were male. Apparently, according to the child safety officers all men are potential paedophiles, but all women are trustworthy.

I'd hate to be a father taking my kid to a park.


Is there anything tangible we can do to take action against these people. So far our command staff are attempting to convince them that we're not paedo's and in fact like helping people. Personally I want this woman sacked for obstruction of emergency medical personnel. There is a law about obstructing emergency services and I want it used. 

Anyone got advice, had something similar?

This whole thing has just left me feeling as if all people see my as a creepy paedo, and obviously quite angry.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_z91i6,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z91i6/i_can_barely_contain_my_rage_been_treated_as_if_i/,

I felt the women /r/MensRights were complaining about was so clearly the minority of women. But what about /r/TwoXChromosomes? How many men sexually harass women at random? Hardly any of them.

If you don't, you might get caught in a rut of negative thinking, and frankly that's just not good for your health. 

If you're spending a lot of time and energy defending mens rights, you'll start becoming obsessed, and that serves no one any good, because you'll start viewing *all human interaction* through a lens of gender politics. Sometimes that's not healthy. Just let people be. 

So, if you take a break, and try not to get offended when someone says a guy's girlfriend could do better, you'll realize that it's just good-natured humor and not a pattern of societal misandry. 

Is Dad being a bozo? Well, maybe that guy likes being a bozo occasionally, and this isn't just him being convinced of his worthlessness by a domineering wife. 

Those may be crappy examples, but you get my drift. Take  a break. Smell the flowers or build a snowman if it's snowy where you are. Read a book. Do this regularly, so as to keep yourself sane.

I GOT MY CAR BACK! It was pretty simple, really. Turns out when she left she'd forgotten to take her jewelry box. I jimmied the lock, and inside was the 200 year old pearl brooch she inherited from her great grandmother, or, as I call it, the ""bargaining chip"". She hasn't been answering my phone calls, so I texted her a picture of the brooch in my vise down in the garage, with a hammer ready to strike. She called me back within 5 minutes, and 2 hours later my car showed up on a flatbed truck. The best part is, she charged the tow to me, so I took the brooch to a pawn shop to get the money for the tow truck driver, so now she has to pay to get it out of hock. 

Thanks for all your support, guys. I'll keep you updated when we actually go to court, or if she tries any more shenanigans. You've been the one bright spot in an otherwise unbearably dark situation.

Today in my Biology class, the teacher looks up from his computer screen and asks us all, ""Are there any young ladies in the room, raise your hands.""

So, all of the girls (and a couple guys that were trying to be funny) raise their hands. 

""1, 2, ... alright, looks like there are 13 girls in the room. Next week, some women from MIT are coming to the school to talk to y'all about engineering. Is anyone interested?""

My hand instantly shot up. (I fucking love engineering). Then I kind of blurted out, ""Wait, just girls? Why can't guys go?""

""Uh... I don't really know. I didn't organize this, MIT did. Don't shoot the messenger, &lt;name&gt;."" Looking around, I guess he was upset that I was the only one with my hand up, so he threw in ""you get to miss class."" At that point pretty much every girl's hand went up. ""Alright, 13 people!""

Then a boy (who I know for a fact is a huge engineering geek) got all upset and asked the teacher why he wasn't counted, even though his hand was up.

""This is just for girls.""

""But how's that fair?! I care way more about this stuff than most of them! Oh, uh, no offense guys.""

""I did not organize this, people. I'm just reading from an email.""

At that point I asked, to noone in particular, if this sort of thing was even legal. It's a public school, our parents' tax dollars should be expected to go toward everyone equally. To my surprise, a bunch of people agreed with me.

A couple boys started complaining that they didn't want to do extra work while we listened to a fun lecture, so the teacher promised them that they could get to watch cartoons and have a free period.

Then a girl yelled out that it wasn't fair that only the guys got to watch cartoons. ""Nobody is forcing you to go see the MIT women talk."" ""Oh, yeah. Forgot.""

The teacher went back to his computer, and normal chitchat ensued. But a bunch of us started talking about how unfair it was that only the girls got to go. The boy glared at me and said, ""then why are you going?"". ""Cause I love this stuff."" ""Sexist."" We got into an argument, about half the class, over whether or not we were sexists by going to the lecture. I think the general consensus was that we were sexists in the same way that black people who get special college grants aimed toward black people are racist, and left it at that. 

At lunch, the principal was standing in the cafeteria for some reason. (Usually it's just the vice principals or guidance counselors.) I asked her why she was only letting the engineers from MI talk to girls. 

""I didn't decide that it was only for girls. They're allowed to do it because that's what their grant was for."" (I don't know what that means, by the way.)

""Doesn't this violate Title IX?""

""That only applies to sports."" A couple kids at my table started objecting, saying that Title IX doesn't only apply to sports. Then some of the upperclassmen a few tables over heard and yelled out that it ""wasn't cool"" that girls got to ""skip class"" while they had to do work.

She said there were too many men in engineering.

""No there ain't! If you treat all the sexes equally, eventually that'll just balance itself out!""

""No, &lt;name&gt;, we need to, as educators, make sure that no gender is being overrepresented in any academic field.""

Eventually more people started asking her questions and arguing amongst themselves until she left. (I might add, she looked really frustrated.)

A couple guys in my grade said they were going to walk in and wouldn't go out unless they dragged them. I really doubt that'll happen, though.

I gotta say, I was surprised by the general response to this blatant sexism. Last year, I had an argument with a teacher who made us write essays about how women are disadvantaged in the modern workplace. Practically nobody sided with me. 

When I refused to go to the single-gendered ""Girls club"" every Friday at lunch in the 6th grade, kids called me weird. 

Then in more recent years, every time somebody was misandrist, hey would take the misandrist's side. 

Not this time, though. I know a few girls who aren't going because they think it's too sexist. I personally am too much of a lazy hypocrite, but still. And people are getting pissed off left and right, asking why they felt the need to have a lecture just for girls when we only get one or two speakers a year.

I need advice.",CoCork5,846,166,220,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1ej8f8/my_girlfriend_has_died_and_now_her_parents_are/,"I know that young accounts aren't tolerated here, but my true account has some of my personal information attached to it. I'm not sure where to start, but here it goes... Sorry if it's so detached.

Last spring semester I met my girlfriend, we'll call her Megan. She was 20 and studying abroad in my country (Ireland) for the semester. I was 25 and she was my everything from the day we met. As corny as it sounds. I've never encountered another person as caring, ambitious, and intelligent as Megan. We were sexually active, and admittedly not as careful as we could have been. She found out that she was pregnant a few days after she returned home in June, and could only tell me over skype. I never got to hold her and tell her that everything was going to be okay. I was able to tell her that I would support whatever she wanted. 

Money is and was very tight for me. I'm back in school and working part time, but I had some money saved up. I knew that I wanted her to keep our baby, but those were my morals and I didn't want to impose them on her. I told her that if she didn't want her parents to find out, I'd pay for her to get an abortion if she could find somebody to take care of her before and afterwards. It would have been impossible for me to go over to America to be with her during this time.

She told me that she wanted to keep our baby and I was pretty overjoyed... despite all of the speed bumps. I looked into transferring to an American college, or getting a work visa. When she told her parents I met them on skype and told me to finish school (I had one year left), and then they would help me move to America to be with Megan and our baby. They were actually very supportive initially; they are a very wealthy, prominent, yet Catholic family, and were pleased that their daughter chose to keep our child. It seemed perfect; It sucked I had to wait so long to be with them, but I knew that it would be worth it to finish my degree and be able to provide for my young family.

For the next few months I skyped my girlfriend everyday, and saved every penny so that I would be able to fly to America for the birth. But, of course, things never go as planned, and Megan went into premature labor this past January (the baby was due in Feb). It's hard to type this. She died giving birth to our son. I wasn't contacted by her parents, and know everything from her best friend, Luke.

Her parents blame me for the death of their daughter and have taken custody of my son. Luke said that they gave him their last name. They refuse to let me see my son, and threaten to have me arrested if I try and travel to come and see him. They want me out of their lives.

Some of you might be thinking that I have dodged a bullet with this crazy family. But I don't give a shit about them. My son is my blood, and one of the only family members I have left. He's my last reminder of Megan. I've told her parents that I would move to America, and that I won't take him from them. I just want to meet him and be at least in the same country of him. Of course, custody is my main desire, but these people have so much money.

I've talked to one lawyer, but he doesn't deal with international paternity, and I can't find one who does. He said that it is probably hopeless, unless they agree to a DNA test (they won't). Is this true?

My only ally is Luke, who has sent me pictures and videos of my son. He said that if I want to travel to the states I can stay with him, but he can't condone me kidnapping the baby. He said that his brother is a lawyer and *will* be able to help me. I'm scared. All I want is my son.

Here is the scene in question: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhF7-QreW2I    (the violence starts at about 4:40 into the clip).

Here's a short description of the salient part in that scene as made by a commenter on Alyssa Rosenberg, for those who doesn't want to see the YouTube clip:
             
&gt;Louie was just sitting next to her, politely (if awkwardly and self-defeatingly) explaining that he would prefer not to perform oral sex on her, when she suddenly lunged at him and slammed his head into window so hard that it shattered. 
&gt;
&gt;While he was dazed from the impact, she then leapt on top of him, pinioned his arm, and bent a finger back to the point it was about to snap, saying ""do it or I'll break your finger."" 
&gt;
&gt;He had no chance to escape (since she surprised him with the first blow), and only conceded to perform the sex act when given the option of doing so or having a bone broken. 

Feminist Alyssa Rosenberg writes an article published on Slate in July 2012: http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2012/07/06/louis_c_k_and_melissa_leo_take_on_sexual_reciprocity_on_louie_.html
                     

In the article she relates how this really is about Louis CK's character's refusal to reciprocate oral sex to Melissa Leo's charachter after a date. Rosenberg downplays the violence and force used by Leo's character and for instance writes this: *""bouncing his head off her passenger-side window.""*
                 
Watch that scene, does that sentence by Rosenberg really describe a sucker punch thrown at the head of Louis sending his head into the passenger side window with such a force that the window breaks?

Alyssa Rosenberg wrote: 
&gt;I found myself cheering for her ideas, even though Laurie is awful.
         
           
Melissa Leo's character's idea was that not only she was entitled to oral sex from the man due to her having done a sex act with him earlier. but she was also entitled to physically force the issue.
                        
  
Rosenberg goes on:
                        
&gt; But even if she's hard to identify with, even if her behavior is embarrassing or horrifying, even if I felt physically uncomfortable watching C.K. give in to her demands, there's something powerful about the way this episode of Louie threw every possible objection at Laurie, made her as unsympathetic a spokeswoman as possible, and acknowledged that she was right anyway.                
               
**""Give in to her demands"" !?**

Apparently Alyssa Rosenberg thinks this scene depicted a man who consented to oral sex - watch that scene again - and finds it powerful to watch - **how scary is that?**

             
                
Edited to add where the violence start in the clip.

1365701758.0,665,self.MensRights,1c5b9c,Wildest thing happened last week and i need to vent,rapingboogeyman,821,156,424,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1c5b9c/wildest_thing_happened_last_week_and_i_need_to/,"First off I'll say, I have a roommate.  He's mid 30s. I'm late 20s.   I moved in with him a few years after his divorce. He had injured himself (fell 2 stories on a construction site), needed help with the rent. I needed a place, he had a basement with its own entrance. We've been roommates for a few years. they spend quite a lot of time at the house and with him.  I've also known them pretty much since diapers, so its not like his children are strangers to me either. 

.... So I am upstairs, and I start noticing alot of traffic (quiet neighbourhood). then i count like 5 or 6 police cars and a van shows up. WOW! SOMETHING EXCITING IS HAPPENING! I figure they've found a grow-op on our street! I text my roommate about it. he texts ""Well, i'm on my way home now, and i have to pee - so they better not block the street off! lol""

As soon has his truck came around the corner the cop cars swarmed him, the van turns out wasn't full of cops- it was child protective services. They pull him out of the car...Then a cop banged on the front door with the two social workers and yelled they have a warrant.  I complied. I'm clueless as to wtf is going on - but i comply. Like the cops went running through the place like they had to find a bomb that was about to go off. 

The lady (social worker, not cop), ordered me to have a sit down because there are some serious questions that need to be answered.  What!? Like what!? She wanted to know the extent of my and the man in the trucks relationship with the female in the vehicle.  I look out.. ITS HIS FUCKING DAUGHTER.

After it all boiled down.. he was at the grocery store and someone called the cops about a suspicious relationship, and the girl was being taken against her will.  Apparently the fact she took his hand and twirlled like a ballerina seemed a bit werid... and i guess the fact in the truck she was bouncing around and dancing to music in the front seat  gave 'the impression of being taken against her will'... 

The questions this lady was asking me felt like she had drawn a conclusion... ""do you communicate online with her?"" do I have a girlfriend? am i involved with the man in the truck? wtf is it your business?... ""do you know her friends? so you spend time alone with these girls?""...wait what? I just know the names of the friends she plays with down the street? ""so, you've befriended the other children on the street?"" WHOA!?! WHAA????? I stop and ask her if there's anything she is trying to insinuate with her line of questioning?  Cop tells me to just answer the question.  I ask if i'm under arrest or suspicion of a crime. He says no. and i told him - ""good! I dont have to answer the question.  But if you need an answer that bad, i'll have my fucking lawyer get back to you.""

The social workers jaw dropped.. and she just started screaming at me. I kept yelling back, TALK TO MY LAWYER to everything she said. Finally she just said ""you're just an incooperative asshole, you know that?"" rofl i shot back ""i've been called worse things by better people""... that got me in the back of a cruiser.... so the got my cellphone because they had to take it out of my pocket. She literally says ""check his messages - see if we got anything"" 

... My girlfriend has been away for a month (she's 24, but petite)... we miss eachother... and she's started to send me 'pictures'...  well guess who got to see those? then the cops start sharing the 'evidence'... and i was nauseated. so angry. so defiled. i cant even fucking type anymore... 

I dont know if i'm going to you for help - or looking for a positive channel to vent my frustrations. if you've had some stories like it... it'd make me feel better :S",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_1c5b9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1c5b9c/wildest_thing_happened_last_week_and_i_need_to/,

I had just finished settling out of court with a girl who attacked me and broke several bones in my face. The entire time I was dealing with this issue our local States Attorneys office referred to her as the 'Victim' and I would have to correct them. They attempted to tell me that she was going to a limited sentence because she couldn't do ""any real harm"" to a man. I fought this, and her, for weeks. Finally agreeing to a financial settlement and mandatory anger management for her. I still feel like she got off too easy. I told the ADA to his face that he knew damn well if I had hit this girl under the same circumstances I would have been arrested the same night and probably still been locked up. He just shrugged. 

So you can imagine how I must have been feeling when I found you all.  I began reading every post and pouring over the wealth of information and news available here. However, now after about three months of this I've decided to unsubscribe. There is nothing here that is remotely uplifting. Just terrible stories about women destroying the lives of men. Cheaters, Liars, Thieves, and just plain Monsters. Today was the worst story of all. (http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1d5yv2/i_cheated_on_my_husband_to_secure_better_genes/)
 Why is there never any stories of hope? Everything I read just makes my blood boil and the comments are just a shouting section of how feminism is evil. Why can't we use this to spread the resources available to men. Help and Tips for single fathers. Stories of overcoming the issues that we face. Ways to better educate our friends and families about mens rights. How to teach your children about true equality. I'm not saying you should stop these posts all together. They are great for reminding us how feminists truly act and the hatred of men that exists among large segments of their followers. But fucking seriously, can't we just enjoy ourselves a bit and be proud of manhood? if we can't and all we talk about is how they win, then its already over. We might as well start hating our penises too. 



UPDATE #1: I appreciate everyone's feedback. It seems many people feel the same way. So in an effort to be a part of the solution I will try and submit an uplifting and inspirational post every Wednesday. Many thanks to /u/LDM312 for the idea! Perhaps I was too quick to split before trying to help. Only together can we begin to make progress.

I sent in the court ordered agreement saying it was my year to claim.
I get a letter yesterday saying I owe $1,400 because my claim is being taken away. 

I called the IRS rep and she said that even though the court order said it was my year to claim, his mother wrote in claiming that she had him for 207 days and I only had him for 156 days.


The IRS took her unsubstantiated claim over a judge signed court order. I am going to appeal this but what the hell?  The system seems to continuously take her side.

Even when she got three DUI's (the third while she was in court for her second) I got full custody but her parents got 50% visitation time so she could still have time with our son with her parents supervision.  

I don't know what to do.  I constantly feel beaten down by this system.  I am a single father and the system is against me.

The Order asks the mother to show cause why the following should not be signed by the Judge. 

1.) An Order ordering that the standing Visitation Order be followed.

2.) An Order for her to provide a landline for my call when out of cell coverage (or the country).

3.) An Order for her to produce the child on Christmas Day, and my other previously ordered visitation days.

We served her by email and FedEx (no response).

The result of this is that if she does not produce my son for Christmas, etc.  she will be in violation of TWO orders and we can then build a Contempt case (a hard thing to do... Courts are reluctant to find a party in Contempt, especially custodial mothers).

Merry Christmas to all the Dads (and Mom's) out there who are wrongfully missing their children.

This is the SECOND animal that has died in the 6 months since she took over my house. This last little guy was a bunny who lived inside. She decided that she would keep it outdoors through the winter and it froze to death. Legal channels did nothing after the first pet died under her watch. I'm not confident that anyone will give a shit now.

1343408791.0,626,self.MensRights,x97bv,Man demonized by media for not taking a bullet for his girlfriend in Aurora shooting.,Dolanduckaroo,895,269,567,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/x97bv/man_demonized_by_media_for_not_taking_a_bullet/,"""Jamie Rohrs, of Aurora, Colorado, took his girlfriend Patricia Legarreta to a midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises,” as you might expect many boyfriends did as a date. In fact, in a mildly kind gesture, he also brought both Legarreta and her two young children.

But then the shooting which has rocked the nation happened, and Mr. Rohrs demonstrated that, far from being kind, he actually might be exactly the wrong person for someone to date. According to reports, Mr. Rohrs not only didn’t try to protect his girlfriend or her children, but he actually rushed for the exit and got into his car, leaving them behind.

Fortunately for Leggareta, there was someone in the theater who was willing to try and help them – a 19-year-old college student named Jarell Brooks who escorted her and her children to the exit, where miraculously enough, the Leggaretas escaped the shooting virtually unharmed. Brooks, however, took a bullet to the leg.

Which brings us back to Mr. Rohrs. Despite his earlier show of cowardice, or perhaps because of it, Rohrs found his girlfriend and her kids at the hospital, and once there, he made the rather counterintuitive move of proposing marriage to Leggareta. And rather than slapping him for leaving her there, she apparently said, “Yes.”

Not that this was the story that initially came out regarding this unlikely coupling. Indeed, Rohrs‘ apparent cowardice is barely mentioned in this interview with Piers Morgan explaining Rohrs’ “harrowing” experience escaping from the theater. Perhaps understandably, Morgan didn’t push him on the full details, though readers might find Rohrs’ narrative more than a little self-serving in retrospect:

However, when more information emerged, showing that Rohrs had actually managed to escape from the theater without either of his children, and that his girlfriend and both those children were actually saved by the heroic Jarell Brooks, questions started to be asked. And since then, several internet sites have begun publicly pleading with Leggareta not to marry the man who left her for dead.

The fascination of the internet with what amounts to the private decision of two people would probably be considered creepy under other circumstances. It may well be here. But one has to wonder whether these armchair relationship counselors have a point. Granted, the man may have decided, in the aftermath of his poor decision, that life without Legaretta wasn’t worth living (since he was facing that prospect rather squarely), but in the absence of evidence that such a decision was made, people have room for suspicion about his worth.

Moreover, if you watch the interviews with Legarreta and her actual rescuer like the one below, and compare the rescuer‘s behavior with Rohrs’, you may come away with a bad taste in your mouth:

What do you think? Should Patricia Legarreta give Jamie Rohrs a second chance?""

Sacrificing yourself for another person is a heroic gesture, but it should be not expected. Because he is a man is he supposed to ""man up"" and be a meat shield? Is that a mans duty these days?

My main hobbies are reading about the MRA movement/gender politcs and govenermental politics.  Obviously, these are two very hostile topics.  They're brutal, they're divisive, and they're very ugly.  

When I was younger, I was always reading about space, or the earth and its natural beauties.  I'm a guy that is absolutely fascinated by something as simple and amazing as weather patterns.  It always brought out that childish wonder in me that we all wish we could hold on to forever.  

But I realized that after I started reading about gender issues and politics, they began to consume me.  I stopped learning about the sciences.  I stopped seeing the joy in life.  The bitter coldness and anger took over my life.  I became distrustful, almost angry at women (though I directed it at radfems, it would be unfair to be angry at innocent women who don't advocate against us).  Every time I would open up reddit, I would come straight to /mr to see how awful our plight was.  It got me down.  The state of manhood is depressing, and we all know why.  

The problem isn't knowing that, or even advocating for men or fighting against unjust policies or anything like that, quite the contrary.  We need men and women to stand up for what they believe is right.  However, we cannot let it take over our lives.  If you surround yourself with ugliness, you will eventually become ugly yourself.  It's a concept we've been warning women about for years - if you keep treating us like animals, animals we will become.  I believe I'm walking proof.

I digress.  My purpose with this is not to bash the movement or discourage people from taking a stand.  Obviously that would be foolhearty - we need men's rights.  The point is that we need to be careful to not become the evil that we fight against.  Eventually, all we see is gender.  We don't see humanity anymore.

I'm still a staunch MRA, and I don't plan on cutting back my advocation, or really my reading.  I'm just going to make a conscious effort to once again take up the hobbies that once made me happy.  I seriously encourage everyone else to do the same.  It's too easy to become depressed in this world, and we all know that there is little support for us when we get down.  It's one of the things we fight for, after all.  

I just hope we can all re-embrace our childish wonders, or whatever old hobbies used to make us happy.   ",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_13pzlw,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/13pzlw/mens_rights_are_important_but_please_dont_let_it/,

Reddit and this sub have been subjected to virtual thugs who are doing it for the lulz, and teamed up with anti-male crusaders, who have been allowed to use them as their private army.

We can't even retaliate by not allowing them access to this sub, we don't have any tools that will stop what they can do. It's a fucking joke. Yes, they are paying a hell of a lot more attention to MRAs now, they are dead scared of our popularity, and to be honest, I am dead scared of a few of the people who call themselves MRAs. To a few of you, it ain't fucking 1800, take your horse and buggy politics back to where it belongs, at a Klan rally or in a museum.

But honestly, what the anti-mens groups are doing, in terms of threats of violence, racism, sexism and frankly the sheer stupidity of them dismissing the real problems men face is brutal and disheartening. Reddit admins, I'm sure you know by now these guys are no joke. They have no problem doing things like harassing rape victims for laughs, and the anti-men crusaders have no problem using them as foot soldiers. Don't let them fool you, they are not really PC type people, go look at some of the things they write on other forums, littered with homophobia, n*gger jokes and foul crass behavior. They are 4chan wannabes who are using the hook of being PC to pull off hours of fun, at the expense of real people with real problems.

This sub isn't like other subs, in that men don't get a place to go when bad shit happens to them. They gotta ""man up"", so when people started finding this place, it became a true godsend to a lot of men who have been abused, beaten, depressed or even raped. They could talk about the problems men face without the stigma of worrying about what people thought as what was expected of them just for being a guy. But now, they have become opportunities, and as a mod we are having to be partial and fair, to people who could give a fuck less about men. I'm sorry, I can't do that any more.

Reddit, these people, they are going to be your FYAD if you don't take them seriously soon. They are using the cover of being the victim to terrorize your user base. Because I know first hand all about that shit. I tried being aggressive to them and banning them....but well, you know.

I hung back and just watch this go on for 2 to 3 minutes. After doing nothing but defend himself from the blows, the female tripped and fell to the ground where he prevented her from getting up. She then slammed her head repeatedly on the ground causing her to bleed and unfortunately a police car on rounds happens to pull in. The cop immediately took him into custody, as she screamed in ""pain"" saying she needed an ambulance and that he did this to her. I attempted to tell the cop what happened, but he didn't care. I told another cop what happened and they blew it off, and even said they didn't need to view the video cameras outside the market.  Their reasoning was that she had a restraining order on him and he violated it by being there. HE worked there. SHE came to his work. SHE assaulted him and he defended himself. I got the guys name and you can be sure as hell that I am going to be next to him in court. And no, I have no idea who this guy is. This system is fucked up. 
TL;DR guy arrest for getting beat up By allowing a girl because he violated a restraining order by allowing her to come to close to where he worked

EDIT:: Wow thanks for all the support! To answer some common questions, I intend on finding out when he will be arraigned and try to be there if I can. I am going to hold off on filing a report with the police because I do not think it will be beneficial at this point. I am going back to the supermarket in the morning to have the manager save the recording of the incident as evidence. And if the guy is interested, I would be willing to help him tell his story to the newspapers, however it would solely be up to him. I will keep you updated. Thank you for all the upvotes.

Really wanted to share this with you guys (I signed up just to post this).

Here is what happened:

I was sitting in a seat on the train yesterday as I was coming home. About twenty minutes into the trip a group of mothers came on, most with prams. I assume this was some kind of mothers club. Four of them sat around me (4 other seats in my area - I was sitting in the one seat for the disabled) and I showed them common curtsy to move my crutches, allowing them enough room to store all their prams. 

Here's the kicker. Two stops later, another one got on. She came over to me, glared and told me that ""I am pregnant and there are no other seats, you need to get out of your seat."" I honestly thought she was joking - My broken leg is pretty obvious, there is a cast and of course the crutches. I looked at her stomach, a tiny bump, couldn't have been more than 5-10 weeks into her pregnancy.

I explained to her my condition. She laughed and now all four of her cronies were staring at me. Did any of them tell this lady (their friend) to find another seat? Nope. Two of her friends said the pregnancy was of more priority than my leg and to move!

What the hell has happened where women think they have some self entitlement over other citizens? This women was barely pregnant yet expected me to stand up with my broken leg!

This whole ordeal didn't last long as another man gave up her seat, which I am extremely grateful for. But I am still furiously angry and so disgusted.

Thank you for reading all that text. I know it is a lot but I thought it was important to remind some sceptical people that this problem is real.

   Let me give you some background about me before I ask my question, I am a 23 year old man who happens to be gay, I am out and proud but it does not define me.
But I have a recurring problem, Every feminist I have ever came across, want to use me as an weapon to further there cause, its degrading, they do not treat me as an equal, but they love to say mras are homophobic and do not care about LGBT rights. Also try to tell me I'm this helpless victim and I need feminism to be ""free"". I do not feel this way, yes I have been attacked/disowned/belittled. But I used those negative experiences to work hard and succeed and make my own in this life, not wallow in sadness. Guess my question is this:

Is there a place for me in the movement? At the end of the day I'm a man, I just like dudes instead of girls. I feel furthering men's right's will help me and other gays to, along with are straight peers. We are all in this life together. But I do not want to be in a movement that can't see me as an equal, just a tool.to further a cause. I want to live in a world that race/sex/gender does not matter, where we judge a person by the actions not who they sleep with or what color there skin is. And I believe men's rights will help make that a reality. I want to help make it. 
 I am not asking if this is a ""safe space"" just if I'm welcome/wanted? 
  
Sorry for the format/errors I'm on a smart phone.

Bob frequents the bar. He's there every day. He's probably about 60 or 65, and smokes cigarettes outside and drinks soda and plays the slot-type machine inside the bar, which gives out tickets that are redeemable for goods at the bar.

Well, since Bob doesn't drink alcohol, he ends up with a surplus of these tickets. Pretty much whenever he sees the boys playing outside in the yard, he'll come over and knock on the door and ask if it's okay to give them some tickets so they can go across the street and get some candy from the bar. We never have a problem with it, obviously. Hell, sometimes Bob even helps with yardwork if we're outside doing that and he's bored. If we're not around, Bob will go to the park and give tickets to the kids there. Everyone knows and loves Bob.

Yesterday someone reported him to the police for the ""crime"" of...*giving children these tickets*.

He wasn't charged with anything, obviously, but the cop told him he probably shouldn't be doing that anymore because someone thinks he's going to molest the children.

Bob is hurt and angry and so am I. 

I know damn well if it was a woman giving tickets to children, no one would have said a damn thing.

I understand some of the concern and paranoia. We live pretty close to Evansdale, Iowa, where the two girls have been missing for over a week, so tensions are high and everyone's on the lookout, but I don't think that's an excuse to nail up a guy like Bob as a pedophile.

Wall of text warning.

I was raised by two radical feminists {yes, a man and a woman} that have been anti-male-everything since before I was born. Everything that can possibly go wrong with the world is a man's fault. Yes, my poor father went along with this, quite happily.

I was homeschooled for a while to keep me out of ""patriarchal influence"", but went back to public school when my mother got bored of ""home slavery""{i.e: taking care of her own child} after 6 months and went back to full time work.

We attended a few feminist gatherings as I was growing up, and this, as could be predicted, brainwashed me into being a mini-radfem. I had no male friends {rape risk} and I was encouraged to act out in classes held by male teachers {to teach them not to speak down to girls}.

I can't say what started the change, but what helped it was definitely making a friend on a forum when I was a teenagers, who I only learned was a man after over a year of talking. He was apparently so afraid of admitting his gender that he hid it from me.

I was furious and of course blamed it on him being ""another filthy man"", but he threw every word back at me, calling me a filthy woman, a stupid whiny girl, among other things. Everything I said he repeated but switched the genders. I blocked him on chat but came back in a day to rage at him again. He refused to talk, but would simply repeat every insult but switch the genders and finish it with ""do you like it better this way?"", over and over.

I don't remember what made this change happen in me, but that was a definite point that I can pin down as being a pinprick of light at the end of the tunnel.

A while later I met my then-boyfriend. I was less radfem, but still totally ignorant of men's rights, and still dismissive of the very idea that they needed rights as much as women.

Thanks to two brothers, he was able to stick up for himself in a fight. Every single time I started a rant about feminism, he'd knock it down. ""Every man rapes"" ""Do I rape?"" ""No.."" ""Then maybe you're wrong about other things, too""
This went down as well as you'd expect the first few times, but gradually I started actually *thinking* about what I was saying before it was said. From that, it was a short trip to researching statistics for myself, questioning what I'd been told was right, and slowly reading bits of men's blogs. 
That was the hardest part, I think, reading first-hand accounts of rape, assault, battery, violence, hatred, sexism and inequality, and not immediately dismissing it as ""men's lies for attention""

Not long after, I joined a men's rights group online and I was really shocked by what I'd been ignoring and mocking. I made a female friend on that group, and we talked often about it.
She described herself as a 'recovering feminist', which I loved, because it suggests coming back from an unhealthy addiction to something self-destructive.....exactly what radical feminism is.

We only lived an hour away from each other, so we started a MRA group for women in between our cities. At first it was basically us having coffee together. Then someone else asked to come along, and she brought a friend. After a few meetings, another girl joined, and brought her two sisters. 

After 7 years, if we took all our members into one room, we'd have 150 MRA-supporting women, between the ages of 4 weeks old {my friend's youngest daughter} and 65 {a member's grandmother}.
At usual meetings though,we usually have between 4-20 people attending our meetings that occur every second month. If it's more than 5 people coming, we organise dinner or lunch at a member's house.
We talk about lots of things, world news, court cases, news articles we've found, frustrating or funny stories about radfems we've met or read about, and if there's a cause we want to support, we take donations and send them, or send a mass email of support. If there's a MRA protest we can go to, we do, and I offer to pay the travel fees for every member to attend, so that we can all be there to show support.

We also have times were it ends up being only personal discussion, women wanting advice in their relationships with feminist parents or friends, we talk about how to introduce the idea of an opposition to feminism to kids, we do baking days to swap recipes, heaps of other normal things that any friends in the world do.

There are regulars and people who only come once a year, but everyone comes at least once and everyone contributes at least once.

Men and boys are welcome, and often show up to give support! They attend en masse when we have a baking day, and that is really lovely to have.
Kids have a choice of joining in discussion, but we make sure there's toys, snacks and colouring stuff to keep them busy because often the discussion is too adult for them.

My parents have no idea about the meetings, and we have a rocky relationship. It was firmly established when I was in my young 20's that as soon as any negative talk about men started, I'd get up and leave. After I did this four Christmases in a row, they listened.

And my long-suffering boyfriend that first started challenging my ideas? We're still going strong, 9 years now, and I'll always be grateful that he gave me a chance. 
Our relationship is just fantastic and we have two children now, a daughter and a son.
I'm still good friends with the man who threw my own insults back to me, and he's planning to visit on a holiday later this year!

Totally and completely adorable, that kid ... and so was his happy-ass dad. Gorgeous.

So this woman (in her 50s, I'd wager) ... takes it upon herself to go stand on the other side of the fence and commence to ""careful ... careful!"" the hell outta the innocuous ""situation.""

The guy picks the kid up and holds him upright by his meaty thighs ... baby is smiling and doing that thing where they gnaw on their fists and make weird, happy sounds.

And the lady starts freakin' out!

""DON'T HOLD THAT BABY LIKE THAT!""

The dad (still smiling) obliges her and says, ""He's fiiiiiiiine"" in such a soothing, placating voice.

The lady turns to everyone watching and goes, ""Oh LORD, it's a good thing the *mother* isn't here!"" ... and walks the fuck away.

Dad just stands there, holding his happy kid and watches her leave.

I couldn't fucking **BELIEVE** what I just saw.

What ... the ... fuck?!

I mean ... first of all, kudos for takin' your son out to the coolest spot in our little town ... 

Secondly, the father OBVIOUSLY loves his kid and it's reciprocated. He's not gonna endanger his son, for fuck's sake!

Next, what if the mother was deceased? ... what if she was fucking DEAD and you just said, ""It's a good thing [she's] not here"" ... ?

So I thought of you guys.

I've never been aware that bullshit like this happens with frequency.

What a CUNT!

So I walk over to the guy ... and I strike up a conversation, while mutually cooing at cute babyhead ... and it gets a little quiet after a moment. He doesn't really seem affected by this bitch (used to it?) so ... I have to bring it up.

I wanna tell him that shit's not cool and she's *definitely* in the minority with that shitty-assed opinion.

""OK, it's none of my business, I know ... but did that lady just say that it's a good thing your son's mother isn't here?""

He's kinda taken aback that someone else heard that.

He admits that he almost said something to her, but thought against it.

""I just wanna apologize on behalf of womankind itself ... that was a REALLY shitty thing to say, on top of just being incorrect.""

We both agreed she sucks for that ... 

And he thanked me for saying so.

So anyway ... thought of you guys.

Got linked to this sub at random and ... never really knew people were so crappy to my dude-buddies.

So ... sorry to you guys, too. Sorry for the unfair laws and for women who just suck.

I just wanted to say that I don't believe in male privilege, but if it exists, I'm a hell of a lot happier than I would have been 100 years ago. Women have come a long way. We're extremely fortunate compared with women from other countries. I don't know what the fuss is about. 



I can't stand when feminists insist on ""equal"" rights but still swear a woman should never be hit (even if she deserved it) or should have doors opened for her, chairs pulled out for her, and her dinner paid for.

My husband and I will have been together for 6 years this month, and we're still going Dutch on dates. I know no other way. The fact that he makes twice as much money as I do has to do with his degree in software engineering, not his sex.


Another pet peeve of mine is when women's shows (read, the View) objectify and laugh at men whose dicks got cut off by vengeful girlfriends. If men would laugh at a woman who had her tits cut off by her angry boyfriend, there would be a huge feminazi outrage. I HATE the double standard.

To hell with political correctness. Please don't downvote me into oblivion. haha. :)




**Edit:** I understand my use of the word ""feminism"" was incorrect. If you go by the textbook, a feminist is someone who wants equal rights for women. However, the meaning of the word seems to have changed. Everyone who at least *identifies* as a feminist, that I know of, could fall into the realm of ""feminazi.""

I wonder what would have happened if *I* took a knife to HER car.  I have a feeling that I would have been handcuffed, and thrown in jail on the spot.

He tells me that if the car is in my name, and I paid it off completely before meeting my wife, then it is MY property and not OUR property.  The first magistrate I talk with tells me that I can't file a complaint against my separated wife because the car is OUR property.  He would not budge on this and refused to go any further.  I tried another magistrate at another county office, and he tells me that I need a police report to proceed further... and this is after I tell him that I have the tire slashing on camera.

(Original post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/z91i6/i_can_barely_contain_my_rage_been_treated_as_if_i/)


Our command staff spoke to the leader of the Child Safety Officers and it emerged that their training was largely the issue in these cases. They had been told in training that men are more likely to be paedophiles etc. and some had taken that to the ""all men are paedophiles"" extreme.

To resolve the issue they are now getting re-trained using actual statistics and less ""men are paedophiles"". Furthermore to boost relations and possibly help us they are all getting free training from the professional service in basic first aid and emergency life support, and some free supplies to use on scraped knees etc. Their command person was apparently very accommodating and receptive to our woes and seems to be committed to fixing this.

Thanks for all of the advice I passed a fair chunk of it on to my command staff in my full report, and things are looking like they should be resolved totally by the end of the month.

Do feminists have no other argument?

A couple of days ago I tweeted about how easy it was for a woman to accuse a man of rape after consensual sex and I went on to say that if that happens the man is guilty until proven innocent, which should not be the case.  I stated that it should be on the victim to prove that rape occurred because in this country you are supposed to be innocent until proven guilty.  

I then went on to make a joke about how I had a couple of one night stands get pissed at me for never calling them again but that I was glad no one had been crazy enough to pull the ""false rape"" card.

Oh my god.  The shit storm that created.  I had complete strangers coming out of the woodwork to call me rapist.  Still two days later I have people tweeting me to call me a rapist, threaten to doxx me, and basically call me a horrible person.  

These people are crazy and I'm tired of men and women equating men's rights with rape.

Women, a feminist video series about female characters in video games. She has been releasing her videos (which is a *12 part series*) piece by piece. These videos are unquestionably of interest to the Men's Rights Movement because Sarkeesian claims, among a lot of other feminist victimhoods, that videogames aimed at boys and men translates into violence against women.

But I'm not here to debate her idiocy. The question is, does the MR community want to discuss this video? The answer to me was clear because the first Tropes Vs. Videogames video had over 500 comments on it.

However, every one of Sarkeesian's videos posted here has very likely been vote brigaded by an off site group, probably IRC or facebook so I've compiled the evidence and threads below. Unlike the SRSers doing this brigading, I post here so it is laughably clear when the karma is not being distributed normally:

This was the first video posted to the sub. Immediately upon posting, MR supporter /u/GuitarsAreKindaCool posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/19vd7q/its_out_damsel_in_distress_part_1_tropes_vs_women/c8rn42j) comment. The other comments were a sea of negativity, and yet that comment in particular was radically upvoted to the top of the thread for no apparent reason. You can see my comment on it directly below, which is where I first noticed this oddity. /u/dalsgaard wrote a great post at the time of posting, but was downvoted heavily and then made a strong comeback to the top. The interest in this thread was so much that the initial downvotes on the link couldn't overcome MRAs upvoting it.

It goes without documenting the SRSers in that thread (many comments now deleted). Regular reddit feminist /u/cleos makes an unremarkable appearance and there are numerous throwaways like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/19vd7q/its_out_damsel_in_distress_part_1_tropes_vs_women/c8ruj4f). /u/rogersmith25 tells us he's puzzled as to why he's getting downvotes with no responses. I wonder?

This got +44/-69, and was killed almost immediately. When I heard the video was out I was confused as to why it wasn't *anywhere* in the sub and I had to scroll for so long to find it.

/u/lalilulelo09 - An SRSer, with 37 upvotes about nothing in particular in a thread with 14 comments.

/u/TheMu - There are so few MRAs in the thread that SRSers have to reply to each other for there to be conversation in the dead thread.

/u/ConflictSerum is a throwaway. Funnily enough one that can't even hide an SRS affiliation in 3 posts.

/u/drgfromoregon - Run of the mill SRSer.

/u/BritishHobo - SRSer. Unsurprisingly appears in the next Tropes vs. Videogames thread! At least they're a gamer.

My question is if the video got flagged as a dead link so early, *how the hell are there so many SRSers and up/downvotes in the thread?*

[Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1jiwgk/damsel_in_distress_part_3_tropes_vs_women_in), [Archive](http://archive.is/OiXma) 

Currently this is +31/-26, almost dead - just a few hours old.

/u/dawn_of_the_don in this thread is a troll throwaway account attempting to derail the conversation in a way they know could be legitimate. Their name is a play on SRSSucks Moderator /u/dawn_of_the_dan, are you shocked people who dislike SRSSucks are turning up?

/u/viriconium_nights an SRSer, even without the posting history you can tell by the [infantile humour](http://imgur.com/sNLiJOB).

/u/klumpp - SRSer. [Can you guess](http://imgur.com/vr06qgH)?

~~/u/Ripowal - SRSer.~~ Ripowal is an AMR poster, but since they also regularly post here I think their participation should be encouraged.

/u/Mantarded - well it goes without saying but it's a throwaway for posting in MR.

/u/what_is_empathy - SRSer

I can't even be bothered because they're still coming. Several other MRAs notice how laughably obvious the vote skewing and brigading is.

I will message the admins to take a look but I'll doubt they'll be able to take action without proof. They *should* considering they shadowbanned a whole bunch of SRSSucks members recently for simply following a link from another community and posting. If the reddit admins were fair these users would be banned into non-existence, the ones stupid enough to not be using throwaway accounts for voting and posting certainly should.

**Even if it's not an organized brigade**, SRSers have a vested interest in how the MR community discusses Anita's videos and they are doing their best to silence criticism on it in a community they are not involved in. Although we are always getting trolled, this is a specific and targetted problem with Anita's videos. It's likely that ** the best thing we can do is to upvote the next video to combat the downvotes trying to silence criticism of Anita's videos**. I realize some MRAs might agree that her videos aren't of interest to this sub, however I think they are the minority. I don't wear a tin foil hat, but it's clear that the sub is not functioning normally when it comes to these videos.

Cheers, just remember - reddit is full of young ~~men~~ people who will understand how onesided and faulty Anita's logic is, and us producing criticism of it will help them relate to larger men's rights causes and understand why feminism is so anti-male.

Today, my blood is boiling. 

Two of my cousins have been at each-others throats for as long as I can remember. I remember blackmail, physical/verbal abuse, theft... etc etc. 

This is not news to me; They've always been manipulative and generally despicable towards each other.

I won't go into the larger details, but one of the cousins had a surprisingly elaborate plan to get the other's daughter taken away from her.

Part of this plan was to bring the cousin to financial ruin (they were quite well-off a few months ago). The first step on causing financial ruin was to get the father fired. All it took was for her to call the hospital the father worked at and **anonymously** accuse him  of sexual assault on the job. Two weeks later, he was fired. 

It has since been confirmed by family members that she was never at that hospital.
Yesterday, she called the cousin to gloat about how it was her who made the call, and how easy it was.

I'm currently in school, studying to be a nurse. I'm furious for him, and I'm seriously worried about how easily shit like this could happen to me too.


TL;DR
Cousin's boyfriend gets accused of sexual assault at work. Gets fired.

Accuser gloats over the phone about how she got him fired. ",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_1il9de,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1il9de/i_never_understood_why_rmensrights_has_so_many/,

Long story short; Girl shoved up with her friend to drink, friend went to sleep, i refused to have sex with the other girl (she is fat and ugly) and i had to get pretty nasty spoken till she got the message. Upon this she attacked me and hit me in the face, i managed to push her out the door and call her school (institue she goes to for trobled kids) and she and her friend were picked up. After disgussing it with the guy who picked them up, we decided to report it monday as assault. (she wrecked 50% of my apartment on her way out while i were pushing her).

I take a nap, 3 hours later police rush my apartment, arrest me, takes pictures of everything and takes along my clothes. Im put in a shitty cell for some time, then questioned for 3 hours. I were charged with rape (of the girl who assaulted me). They took my pictures and fingerprints, and my entire family were in the waiting room crying.

They felt the girl were a lying bitch and they realised that i dident do shit pretty early, so after 3-4 hours of questioning and medical checks and so on i were released.

Now im sitting here, mad like hell. This case is 99% chance it just gets pushed away for being one persons tale vs anothers.

So what im asking is WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT? DID SHE JUST GET A FREE SHOT OF TRYING TO SEND ME TO JAIL FOR 8 YEARS? WTF am i gonna do? Its night and i got home a few hours ago. I will get a letter wether they will charge me or not.

Is the system this broken? She gets off assault and trying to get me to jail for 8 years just ""cause"" its statement vs statement?

WTF AM I GONNA DO NOW?

I live in Denmark. Sry for grammar mistakes, english is not my first language.

I found this document:
http://www.180grader.dk/Leder/stop-de-grundloese-voldtaegtsanmeldelser-smid-kvinderne-i-faengsel
I know it is in Danish but it says ""98 of 100 women dosent get punished and thats the proven liars"".

HOW CAN THIS FUCKING BE? WTF IS THIS LOOPHOLE SHIT??
The reason behind low conviction rate of rape liars is because many of them have ""mental"" issues. 
OH YE AND MEN WHO RAPES DONT HAVE ISSUES? AND THEIR SEND TO JAIL. FUCK THIS AND FUCK ALL ABOUT IT.


EDIT : 
SO FAR 2 LAWYERS TOLD ME THIS CASE IS LOST. SHE GETS OFF. SIMPLY BECAUSE WHEN A WOMEN ACCUSE A MAN OF SEXUAL OFFENSES SHE IS MORE TRUSTED THAN HIM = SHE CANT PROVE I RAPED HER BUT I CANT REALLY PROVE I DIDENT. What the fuck is that lawyer responds? WTF IS WRONG WITH THIS WORLD.

Apparently lawyers dont wanna deal with this due to the shitty conviction rate. 
Im 20, got time to reschool for mens right lawyer. Fucking considering it.

EDIT 2:
Found a lawyer who will help me get payed for false arrest and false charges, if i get off as innocent and not as ""not enough proof"". No justice towards the girl. Only society paying for her mistake. 
We will charge the police with Retsplejelovens §1018a. 

EDIT 3:
As promised to a fellow reddiotor 100% of the money i should obtain throughout false arrest (and if im extremly lucky false charges from the girl and damages), will be donated to brian banks project. Will post proof. Seems like the obvious thing to do with the money.

EDIT 4:
Just got off phone with the police, apparently their still waiting for all the doctors papers to get in before they will let me off charges.

EDIT 5: Just talked to a officer who said that i will get a final answer tomorrow, but that i shouldent worry about it. He told me it will be possible to raise charges against her as it seems now!!!

&gt;Of the 132 men
who sought help from a DVagency, 44.1% (n=86) said that
this resource was not at all helpful; further, 95.3% of those
men (n=81) said that they were given the impression that
the agency was biased against men. 

&gt;Some of the men were
accused of being the batterer in the relationship: This
happened to men seeking help from DVagencies (40.2%),
DV hotlines (32.2%) and online resources (18.9%). Over
25% of those using an online resource reported that they
were given a phone number for help which turned out to be
the number for a batterer’s program. 

Even worse:

&gt;The results from the
open-ended questions showed that 16.4% of the men who
contacted a hotline reported that the staff made fun them, as
did 15.2% of the men who contacted local DV agencies.

There are a few conclusions we can draw from this data.

The most obvious being what we already knew, DV agencies are likely to be anti-male.

Further, the Violence Against Women Act, which funds these agencies, is therefore female privilege/discriminating against men.  It is in reality not gender-neutral, despite what it says in its text, and despite what feminists on reddit or elsewhere will tell you.

I've only had to read for 2 weeks to see the complete ignorance of some people under the guise of ""You're a misogynist if..."", while turning around to perpetrate some of the very discrimination they've worked so hard to solve for women.

It started with a link to this on facebook

http://sexistfacebookdudes.tumblr.com/post/43562054395/a-new-bingo-card-to-go-with-the-facebook-sexism

and turned into:

**Me:** It's unfortunate that the few good points they have (serious lack of male victims of DV shelters for example) are overshadowed by the shitty opinions of idiots. Also fedoras.

**Her:** Many shelters have provisions for men like setting then up with hotel rooms but sadly many abusers will act like the victim as a form of control. And fedoras.

**Me:** If you actually think that's an acceptable argument for completely under-providing for male victims, you're disgusting.

**Her:** Males are the primary abusers in relationships and I did not advocate for with holding care for male victims.

**Me:** Right, you just said ""Well actually we give them hotel rooms"".... ""because they're probably abusers trying to get at their women"". That's so fucking... I don't even know where to start. YOU may not advocate against it, but very high profile (feminist) organizations have actively lobbied AGAINST legislation and petitions for federal/state funding for male victims of domestic abuse. Such was the case with Earl Silverman.

Not to mention, you're wrong on the numbers. On average, the primary agressor is as likely to be female, and a MAJORITY of DV cases are reciprocal in nature. However, it doesn't even matter: The question is simply ""Well yeah... why don't male victims have similar avenues of escape and support?"". Sadly no one thinks they even exist.

And the sad thing is, I've been called a pig for simply asking the question ""what about male victims?"", and shit like this makes me livid. The center block on this poster makes me fucking livid. I don't give a fuck about feminist or MRA rhetoric, I don't give a fuck what you think about me, I give a fuck about the victims, male or female.

But go ahead, keep minimizing support for male abuse victims because: ""many abusers will act like the victim as a form of control.""

And fedoras.

**Her**: i had no part in that? i have no idea who did, but since he was part of the men's rights movement i seriously doubt his other intentions were pure. men's shelters? yes great. i believe in gender segregating shelters to keep all victims safe. 

my numbers are fine. look up statistics. women are more likely to require medical treatment for their abuse than men, and women are more likely to be killed by an intimate partner. domestic violence is the number 1 killer of pregnant women. 

and people might be mad at you for derailing conversations about women victims of abuse if you bring up male victims in DV discussions as if you cannot care about both men and women at the same time. i'm not minimising support for bringing up the fact that abusers are also manipulators and will go to great lengths to keep the power in relationships. if a woman is raped she is most often not believed and double guessed, or told to rethink her story and we treat that as normal, because women are liars and manipulators, and just want to get men in trouble. where is your outrage? why is your outrage only over men? i have spoken out against the abuses of the catholic church on young boys and the sandusky scandal. i have spoken out against the murders of trayvon martin and other innocent men murdered by police. but these men who only care about domestic violence when it is perpetrated against men are nowhere to be found in the steubenville case, or the amanda todd tragedy, and are so quick to forget that lorena bobbit was raped before attacking her husband. women have to care about men too for fear of being called sexist, but men do not live with this threat. it's men that make it unsafe to hold the radical feminism convention in the UK, while neo nazis and anti gay protestors can hold their signs freely without risk of retaliation. 

and you have feminists to thank for the FBI expanding the definition of rape to include men as possible victims.

**Me:** He wasn't a part of the Men's Rights Movement. He was a victim of domestic abuse who couldn't get help, was re-victimized when searching for help by women's shelters telling him HE was the real perpetrator, and ultimately took a stand and opened his own privately funded men's shelter. He was then lobbied against, shamed, raided, and sanctioned because he dared to speak up as an advocate for male victims.

You had no part in it? You have a part in it every time you minimize the issue that underreporting of male victims isn't a problem, quote shitty statistics from Duluth Model studies that represent less than 20% of all DV cases (which means there's alot more women out there, by the way), and continue to subscribe to the idea that men are the default agressor.

I'd like to remind you that men are at higher risk for suicide, especially in cases of being abused. I'd like to remind you that men killed by their intimate partner are often done so in such a way that can be ruled suicide. I'd like to remind you that men killed by men hired/enlisted by their intimate partner are reported as ""multiple conspirator"" homicides, as opposed to domestic violence (that really skews the numbers a bit, you think?). I'd like to remind you that because of assumption of male agressor laws, that regardless of who is actually abusing who (or even if the case is mutual), in some states the man is automatically arrested, and crime statistics reflect this. Quoting crime statistics is a good way to count the number of charges made, and a really good way to ignore the real problem of how domestic violence starts, continues, and ends.

Here is a question for you. In advocating for women's shelters, can I not easily assert what you have? Where is your outrage over the fact that battered men have no where to go? Are you a misandrist? NO. YOU ARE NOT. YOU ADVOCATE FOR WHAT YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. For fuck's sake &lt;name redacted&gt;, you can't assert that my ""lack of outrage"" is indicative of hatred, while DOING THE SAME THING.

You're straw manning arguments left and right because it doesn't serve women's rights, and forget to stop and say ""oh hey maybe they've got a real point on that thing..."". Instead you choose to say ""Battered men? WHAT ABOUT RAPE VICTIMS!"" You're thinking circularly. 

I'd like to remind you it's feminists who pulled the fire alarm and threatened violence against MRA's talking about educational problems boys are having and violence against men. Your argument against this will soundly be ""oh those are the radicals"", but so will mine.

I can't even bring up domestic violence against men without being called a misogynist. You don't see the problem there?

**Her**: women are more likely to end up in the hospital or dead because of male violence. it is not the womens faults if a man is assumed to be an abuser when he is the victim, it is patriarchal ideals of masculinity backfiring on men who have become victims. patriarchal society tells men they cannot be victims, and we have internalised these gender roles. while women and men may equally be aggressors, women are more likely to end up in the hospital or dead from DV. if a woman slaps you, that's wrong, but if you hit her back and break her nose, that's not equality.

statistics are all we have. yes domestic violence is underreported for a vast amount of reasons but we have nothing else. we can only encourage victims to come foward.

ver 50% of all women murdered are murdered by an intimate partner. contract killings make up only 2% of all murders in the US. there are no statistics on domestic violence and contract killing that i can find. 

im not straw manning anything. you're the one who always comes in saying that things are sexist against men because these masculine gender roles do not benefit you specifically. i can care about womens rights without having to apologise for lack of coverage about male victims. the problem is when a conversation about violence against women is derailed because ""some men are abused too."" yes we all know men are abused, but by and large violence against women is a global problem that is not limited to domestic violence. you're not a misogynist for caring about men HOWEVER it is a common theme that feminists must answer for violence against men as if we are the primary perpetrators. violence and rape against men is LARGELY COMMITTED BY OTHER MEN which feminists are blamed for consistently. and feminists are the ones who want to break down the oppressive gender roles that tell men they cannot be victims.

**Me:**  Oh, there we go. It's patriarchy's fault that men are being ignored.

How about we ADDRESS THE FUCKING PROBLEM by ADVOCATING FOR SOLUTIONS like SERVICES FOR MEN instead of saying ITS THE PATRIARCHY! Or... you know... what MRAs have actively tried to do.

The reason you get to quote statistics on the number of male agressors and female victims is because research has been done on that. In contrast, relatively NO research has been done on female aggressors and the number of male victims, and the research that HAS been done has mostly said the same thing ""It's equal or reciprocal"", but no one is there to champion it for solutions (except those dirty dirty MRAs who want to take your rights away...)

I've never once asserted things are sexist against men. I've asserted there is a problem not being dealt with because legislation and studies are not being done to address problems men face, while pointing out those same problems ARE being addressed for women. Whether or not I would call that sexist... probably not by your definition.

I can care about men's rights without having to apologize for a woman being raped. I didn't tell the guy to rape her, nor did I rape her. The problem is conversations about male victims are derailed by organizations that have a vested interest in keeping reported numbers of female agressors out of public knowledge, because money talks and it doesn't suit their argued case.

The problem is, I don't disagree with you. You have this somewhat twisted version of reality where MRA's are inherently against women gaining rights, or that they think any kind of violence against women is healthy. Meanwhile in reality we're just raising our hands to say ""Hey... maybe we should address some problems for the other half of population too."" Somewhere off in lala land, it's seen as misogyny to care about that.

@Other Girl who chimed in - male centered agencies? In 1 province in canada there are 671 publicly funded beds for women to escape abuse, on top of privately funded organizations. For men? TWO. They're not even publicly funded. But when someone like Earl Silverman tries to lobby for some? Oh no, he's a bad guy.

**Me (capstone):** I'd also like to point out that while physical abuse is one type of abuse, mental and emotional abuse is just as serious. Abused men are more likely to be mentally and emotionally abused by partners who drive them to the point of suicide because they can't escape. Why can't they escape? If they run away from their abusive partner, they can be charged with abandonment. If they take the kids with them, they can be charged with child abduction. Do you think the their partners aren't aware of this? It's used to abuse them.

It's different types of abuse, but for some reason, society is eerily silent about trying to help. Fuck me for speaking up, right?

**end note**: It goes on from there a bit, but ultimately I continue to refute points she brings up, eventually ignoring points about NOW actively lobbying for default maternal custody, the disingenuous 70 cents/dollar figures adjust to 90-95, and writing off paternal rights as ""Pregnancy is unequal because biology is unequal.  MRA's don't want the responsibility for any children they father"", which I just couldn't fathem how someone actually believes that's what is true.  That's absurd.

**Edit:** Thank you for all the responses, for and against.  I want to spark more conversation, not silence anyone.  I hope that the comments will also welcome commentary from opponents as well as proponents of the Men's Right's Movement.  I posted a continuation of the conversation in the comments below.

**Edit 2:** It looks like i've lost a friend over this.  Sigh.

**Edit 3:** It's fun to watch the upvotes and downvotes fluctuate.  I often wonder why the downvoters downvote, as many of them never post any dissent.  I've read every reply here and have seen nothing more than proponents of MRM (save the new FedoraRightsMovement that has apparently started from this thread).  Oh and the one guy who keeps posting that 30 minute long video that I just haven't gotten around to watching yet.  [Someone watch it and respond please](http://youtu.be/qp-RaZ6OjGQ)

1356515293.0,517,self.MensRights,15gnyz,7 Tactics Used by Academic Feminists To Suppress Information,actanonverba8,733,216,134,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15gnyz/7_tactics_used_by_academic_feminists_to_suppress/,"These are tactics described by Murray A. Straus, PhD.  He is a sociology professor who has been researching domestic violence for decades.  He describes these tactics in an academic review entitled, ""Thirty Years of Denying the Evidence of Gender Symmetry in Partner Violence: Implications for Prevention and Treatment"" (available for viewing here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/mensrightslinks/comments/15f02x/dpipv_review_thirty_years_of_denying_the_evidence/)

**Tactic one:  ""Conceal The Evidence""**

For example, say a study is done and the results show that 10% of women and 9% of men do bad thing 'X'.  Some feminists simply exclude the information about the women from the published version of the studies.  So, when people read the published results it only says that ""9% of men do bad thing 'X'.  

**Tactic two:  ""Avoid Obtaining Evidence on Female Perpetration""**

This is where an advocacy researcher (i.e. ideologue) doctors the research tools so that no ""undesirable"" information is discovered.  For instance, let's say there is a standardized survey or questionnaire in which question 15 asks the women being studied, ""How often has your partner done bad thing ""X"" to you?""  The advocacy researcher will keep that question in.  But, now let's say question 16 goes on to ask women, ""How often have you done the same bad thing 'X' to your partner?""  The advocacy researcher will simply delete question 16 from the survey BEFORE doing the research.  In this way, they can be sure not to unearth any of the ""undesirable"" information they don't want to hear (or publish) in the first place.  It also saves them from having to face other academics who may ask to see results (there are no results for them to be embarrassed about because they made sure not to ask).

**Tactic three:  ""Selective Citation of Research""** 

This is pretty straightforward.  Say I'm a feminist advocacy researcher (or, as in the case discussed by Straus, a large, respected organization like the World Health Organization that is heavily influenced by feminists), I will simply cite only the research--usually research by other advocacy researchers--that agrees with the message I want to put forth.  So, while 50 studies may say what I want to hear and 200 may say things I don't want to hear, I only cite from the 50 and this then becomes the ""official"", accepted information parroted in the media (because feminist organizations and organizations like WHO are very big, well-funded, and influential).

**Tactic four:  ""State Conclusions That Contradict The Data""**

This is where an advocacy researcher will just put her (or his) head down and stick to the company line regardless of the results.  Straus talks about a study in which the results showed that a very low percentage (6.9%) of women who perpetrated domestic violence did so out of self-defense.  Nevertheless, the researcher, in the conclusion section of the study,  wrote that women engaged in domestic violence ""primarily"" in self-defense.  This was in complete contradiction to the researcher's own results!   (Note:  sometimes, as discussed in Straus' review, researchers do this because they are scared of the personal and career consequences of angering feminists).

**Tactic five:   Block Publication of Articles That Have Information Feminists Don't Like**

This happens during the time where a researcher is already researching or has completed the research and is getting ready to publish.  Feminists will do all manner of unethical things to simply stop information from coming out.  They go on letter writing campaigns, try to destroy the person's reputation, try to undermine the person's career, and so forth.  They contact the person's boss or anyone they can (especially if it's an influential ally) to try to make the person's life hell.  They may contact journals and threaten protests.  Basically, a bunch of intimidating behaviors that include defamation, backstabbing, implicit and/or explicit threats.  They do these things to intimidate the target into dropping his or her own research or to get someone else to shut down the target's research.  It is also useful to feminists because it sends an intimidating message to others who want to do honest research (instead of the feminist ideological kind).

**Tactic six:  Prevent Funding of Research**

Straus talks about how there are review committees that make decisions about which research proposals will receive funding.  He also talks about how incredibly competitive the world of getting research funding is.  Apparently, feminists work to make sure that they get some of ""their people"" on these review committees.  The feminists on the review committees will then complain  vehemently about and score very low any research proposals that go against the feminist doctrine, effectively killing the research proposals in the review process.

**Tactic seven:  Harass, Threaten, or Punish People Who Publish Information Feminists Don't Like**

This goes on after a researcher has published a study that angers feminists.  Here, Strauss talks about personal anecdotal experiences (he has been around for decades, though).  He talks about one woman who suffered an organized feminist assault feminists on her career and efforts to get tenure.  The feminists claimed she was not to be promoted (and implied she was a ""scientific fraud"") because her results showing high levels of domestic violence by women ""was not believable"".   One researcher had a bomb threat called in to her daughter's wedding after publication of information feminists didn't like.  Straus also talks about feminists stopping people they don't like from speaking at universities (like they tried to do to Warren Farrell in Toronto) and feminists getting people blocked from government hearings.  Straus discusses more anecdotes (they're in the review).  

*I hope that my writing out these tactics will be at least a little bit helpful to someone, somewhere.  Thanks for reading.* 

Edit:  **An additonal Tactic:  Altering definitions**

This one is not included in Straus' review.  But, it happens frequently.  For example, say a feminist researcher defines-down rape for a study.  She (or he) will then, predictably, get the results she wants (i.e. a highly inlfated number).

And this one: http://i.imgur.com/07lT7.jpg

Lately I've noticed a lot more of these gender flipping posts where it isn't used to serve a point, and really just makes our arguments much more confusing.

If you are going to do something like posting a statistic, PLEASE don't flip the genders and explain at the end how your master plan was to trick them into believing women had it worse, when in reality it was men. 

Reversing the genders is an effective argument when someone makes a comment regarding men or women that would have a completely seperate implication when the genders are switched. A common example is a female teacher who sleeps with a male student and draws comments such as ""lucky kid"", and so on. Reversing the genders in cases like this is effective at proving a point. Saying ""95% of workplace deaths are women..... JUST KIDDING IT'S ACTUALLY MEN"" is just plain pointless, makes you look pretentious, and can actually have the reverse effect if people don't read to the end of your posters.

Edit: Most of the objections to this post seem to be geared towards the idea that it forces people to re-evaluate their feelings after having believed it was women who were disadvantaged. I can see the logic behind this; however, please consider the following:

1) Is it worth the number of people who will not read the whole post, or be confused by the message?

2) Will the people who shrug off general posts about men's rights really re-evaluate their position in these cases, or just shrug it off as usual once they realize they were deceived?

3) Are people actually fooled by the edited statistics? Are people actually buying that 95% of workplace deaths are women? I think it's fairly common knowledge that men have the most dangerous jobs, as one example.

As I said, I admit there are pros to wording arguments this way, but I think they are outweighed by the cons. The idea is to educate through statistics and facts, not deception.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,1358524175.0,,,True,t3_16tg5t,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/16tg5t/ok_guys_the_gender_flipping_is_getting_out_of_hand/,

1350251114.0,509,self.MensRights,11h9b9,"Message I got from girlwriteswhat a while ago in response to me asking ""What does 'privilege-blind' mean?"".",JeremyKean,624,115,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/11h9b9/message_i_got_from_girlwriteswhat_a_while_ago_in/,"After a long four days talking to feminists over at /r/askfeminists, I received a message from girlwriteswhat. This message was pretty much my red-pill introduction into the MRM. I was pretty blown away by it. When I showed it to another MRA, he said I ought to make it a self post so more can see. So here it is!

&gt;It means that in the culture, each gender has/had both obligations and entitlements or benefits. When you live your whole life with certain entitlements, you usually don't realize that you have them, or the ways you benefit them, or that the other doesn't have them and cannot benefit from them.

&gt;Most feminists call traditional male entitlements ""privilege"". They call traditional female entitlements ""benevolent sexism"" (because like most people who benefit from their entitlements, they can't really see they have them). They call traditional female obligations ""oppression"". They call traditional male obligations ""rights"" (i.e: the right to earn income, the right to be self-sufficient, which was actually an obligation men complied with or else, and still is) or ""patriarchy hurts men too"".

&gt;What feminism has really done in the advancement of women's interests is take men's patriarchal obligations, apply them to women, and cast them as ""rights"" that women can choose or not as they see fit. It--with the help of advancements like the pill--has also toiled to free women from their patriarchal obligations while holding onto as many entitlements as they can. Like removing the obligation to marry for life or provide their husband with children that are his in a meaningful way, while keeping the entitlement to his financial support.

&gt;And please don't get me wrong. I'm not a traditionalist in any way shape or form. But I do live in reality, and I know what's been happening over the last 40 years.

&gt;The problem with what's going on now is that as women are released from their obligations (to men and to society), without giving up corresponding entitlements...things are getting unbalanced. The system we had before sucked for a lot of people, but it was at least equitable for both genders--it afforded enough entitlements to offset each member's obligations. When you remove obligation from one member while holding onto the entitlement, this places more obligation (and less entitlement) on the opposing member.

&gt;A great deal of women's traditional benefits used to be provided by men on an individual basis (financial support, partnership, protection, etc), but now men have been kicked out of the house, so to speak. Because women have so much more choice now--because they claimed things like earning income as rights rather than obligations--and because they owe nothing to anything other than personal fulfillment...well, choices cost. They cost economically, socially and politically.

&gt;Men aren't being allowed to fulfill those benefits on reasonable terms anymore--women have broken the old social contract, and when we took away men's benefits without replacing them with others, we soured the terms of the deal for them. Now we need more government, more social, legal, enforcement and corporate structures to provide women with help, support and protection, or to extract those things from unwilling men. None of those structures are ""non-profit"". They take a huge cut before what's left trickles back down. They're a very resource-hungry middleman, so we need more productivity on the ground in order to feed that. Most of that productivity comes from men, one way or another, even though their few remaining benefits no longer make it worthwhile to them.

&gt;That means we're trying to chain men even more inexorably to their old obligations. There's a reason everyone in the media is in a tizzy over men not ""manning up"". Men have always either provided for women and children, or been economic generators for government and corporate coffers. They've always put more in than they've taken out--women drive 80% of consumer spending. Now they're being asked to put even more in, and get less out.

&gt;Let me put it this way. Women make up about 60% of med students right now. Very progressive. The government spends millions of dollars to train her, because paying to train doctors is a wise investment. Doctors earn out the wazoo. This generates tax revenue and economic activity, which helps recoup the cost, and doctors provide a valuable service to society that helps keep everything stable. Spots in med school are finite because of the cost of training, and the woman beats out several male candidates for that spot in school.

&gt;But what's this? She sees that career as a right rather than an obligation. She has virtually unlimited choice as to what she wants her life to look like. So, like about half of all female doctors, within ten years of getting her MD, she will be working part time or not at all. Her male colleagues saw their career as an obligation, and expected to be working 50-70 hours/week for at least 30 years, providing valuable service to society and generating all kinds of economic benefit.

&gt;That female doctor has just taken out of society more than she's put in. Someone not only has to pay for that, and take up the slack. We all pay, with our tax revenue, and by having to wait to see a doctor, and her male colleagues pay in the longer hours many will choose to work to fill the gap she left in her wake. And because women represent more than half of all doctors, the fewer males ones will have to take on even more burden in order to ensure you and I can get an appointment.

&gt;And I'm not saying that women shouldn't be doctors--hell, my sister is one. But I AM saying that though women have made inroads into the male roles, they haven't embraced them in any meaningful away, because it actually sucks to work 70 hours a week and barely see your family, whether you're a man or a woman, and society doesn't enforce this role with women the way it does with men.

&gt;You won't find a single feminist wanting to talk about this stuff. They won't even accept that women have, and have always had, female privilege. All those spots on the lifeboats while the men went down with the ship? That was just another form of oppression to them.

&gt;You're young. You seem exceptionally bright and well-spoken, and you have every right to feel dismissed and disregarded by the people on AskFeminists. They are writers of revisionist history and revisionist reality--emotional reasoners who form narratives to explain their emotions, instead of living in reality. Please don't get sucked in by them.

&gt;There are women's issues, but feminism seems to mostly work at cross-purposes to those issues. How can you complain that women are not trusted in positions of political power--how even women won't vote for them--and then in the next breath cast women in this role of needing perpetual help and support just to survive their own lives, all the while whining that purses are oppressive? I'm a woman, and one of the biggest problems I have with feminism is that it does not give women any credit.

&gt;Anyway, I thought I would reach out to you--off thread, because I don't want to cause another shitstorm right now. I'm a mother of three kids, two of them boys. My oldest is 17, and I worry about the world he and his brother are growing up in. I know my daughter will be just fine.

They get uncomfortable and he has told me how he feels in class when this happens, that it makes him feel uncomfortable and distracts from what we are really trying to do which is heal. 

I really like this guy and I believe he deserves the same respect as the other girls give eachother. He is married and we talked a lot about how men and women don't have specific roles how he has been stay at home dad kind of like my so when he needed to support his wife and they both worked at times ( he was a special ed English teacher).

Ive gone out of my way to let him work on me so he can get past his discomfort especially on glute work which is important for our careers. Now he actually is much less hesitant and on our hand on final with the public the woman he worked on (who kept her underwear on when they knew that they were not supposed to but it was because he was an older male) was so happy with how much pain he had reduced for her with the glute work he
did. Also he is a great massage therapist.


I hear constant nagging about men in class from over half the girls who don't understand how sexist and disrespectful They sound generalizing and degrading men. Also most of them are married or have boyfriends and constantly hit on and sexuqlly harass the younger men, what q bunch of bs if it was the other way around it would not be acceptable.

We have been managing custody and support issues ourselves, as we do not have court orders in either respect. My son lived with me for the entirety of the last school year while he was going to preschool -- his mother had asked me to take him so that she could ""get her shit together"" (her words) as her new marriage had failed after only 6 weeks and she was trying to figure out what to do next. We live in different cities now, separated by about a 40-minute drive.

I registered my son for kindergarten in my city, and he attended the first three days. This was not acceptable to his mother, who was adamant that he should be living primarily with her and going to school in her town. After those first three days, I returned my son to her for the weekend, and she has been preventing me from seeing him ever since. She enrolled him in a different school in her city.

Yesterday was the end of the second week at the new school, and I decided I would pick him up at school, because I'm not able to see him any other way and I am within my rights to do so. What happened blew my mind.

I presented my ID and proof of my paternity to the front office, who proceeded to tell me that unless I was listed on the ""emergency contact form"" they have, I could not take my son. I argued for a while, asked if *I* could submit an emergency contact form (""only the person who has registered him for school can do that,"" they said), etc. and got nowhere. I asked to talk to the principal.

Before I was able to talk to her, one of the office aides called his mother and proceeded to tell me that ""mom doesn't give her permission for you to take him."" Note again that there is *no* custody arrangement with the courts, meaning I have every right his mother does in choices of upbringing, custody, and so on. So I talked to the principal, and was denied my child again. ""Sorry, it's the law,"" she said once, and ""sorry, it's district policy."" I didn't feel that making a scene would be to my benefit here, so I left without my son and looked up the law.

Turns out, both the Code of Federal Regulations (34 CFR 99.4) and the district's official policy explicitly say that both parents have the right to release of a child unless the school has legally binding documents indicating otherwise. Needless to say, I feel very violated and angry. I want my son and I want justice. I am considering talking to some attorneys to see if they are interested in this situation.

I wanted to ask MR, though, what would you do in this circumstance? Has anyone here been through something similar? Any advice for this angry dad?

TL;DR: School violated my rights when they refused to let me pick up my son. What's the next step?

I am a 20 year old male and this is my story.

I got invited to a party in another town earlier this week, it's about 30 minutes drive away from the town I live in. So after pre-drinks at my buddies, I headed out to this other town to meet people, this was about 11pm by this point. 

Got there no problem, immediately met this gorgeous girl, pretty face, great body, big perky breasts and a nice ass! (HB8 if you're familiar with the term) So naturally I started flirting with her. Anyway the night progressed as usual, me and this girl talked a little bit on and off. Blah blah blah boring irrelevant filler stuff. When talking to a couple guys I know they're like ""Oh dude stay away from *her name*, she's a total slut"", and this other girl is like ""Aww dude, no. Just no!"". This put me off a little bit but I'm not really someone to pay any attention to gossip, I think girls want sex just as much as we do, and me &amp; this girl seem to get along so whatever I just ignore it.

Eventually it gets to what I think is about 4 or 5am, I am lying on my back in a bedroom feeling rough as fuck with no shirt on sort of passing in and out of full consciousness. The next thing I know this girl is next to me, she bends down &amp; kisses me, I kiss back. She grabs my cock out and starts jerking me off. I'm just lying there like ""Hey, I'm okay with this""

The next thing I know she pulls my pants right off and straddles me 'cowgirl' style. At this point I realize this chick is completely naked! Sort of grinding on me and still stroking my dick. At this point I have woken up somewhat and I'm like damn I'm totally getting laid. I grab my pants and look in the pocket to reach for my wallet because I know I have a condom in it, and my pocket is empty! Wallet gone! Shit. I look back at the girl and say ""Fuck have you got a condom?!"" to which she says ""No! It's fine I'm on the pill.""

Whoaa something just hits me, I think slow the fuck down and remember what people were saying earlier. 
Me: ""That's not the point!""
Her: ""Hey fuck you, I'm clean!""
Me: ""Why, have you been tested?""
Her: ""No, I'm just clean!""
Me: ""Um okay, I'm not just going to take your word for it! How many people have you had sex with anyway?""
Her: ""I don't know, like 25 or 30! I've been on the pill since I was 16 it's fine I'm clean""
Me: ""You keep saying that. I'm not risking it sorry.""  I say, after thinking shit that is a lot of people and I have no idea where she's been.

At this point her whole persona changes. She grabs my dick and tries to stick it in her and I lift my knees up to stop her. I'm like ""Hey what the fuck! I said I'm not having sex with you without a condom!"" and she's like ""Oh come on aren't you tempted! Fuck me!"", I say ""Look it's not happening sorry"". She starts to get really aggressive and shouts at me ""Shut up you fucking pussy and pound me already!"" 
At this point I get pretty pissed, I say back ""Look get the fuck off me! It's not happening!"" and I try to roll over &amp; throw her off and completely fail. Jesus christ this girl seems heavy, she's thin but she's just totally rooted there! Bear in mind I'm ruined at this point and I don't want to be too violent &amp; hurt her. This seems to really, really piss her off, she gets full on 'angry face' and slaps in in the side of the head, hard. She has a bunch of big rings on and it hurt like hell I'll tell you that much! I see stars for a second (which has only happened once before in my life when I crashed racing downhill mountain bikes) &amp; I think she thrust down and stuck my dick inside her, she's super loose I don't feel any of the usual 'vagina' feelings just sort of, space... I shout at her ""Fuck you slut! Get the fuck off me!"" she slaps me again kind of over the ear, my ear pops and I feel dizzy, and one of her rings hits me right in the temple and I just black out.

I woke up what I guess was a few hours later to find us both totally naked &amp; her fast asleep next to me with head head on my shoulder. I just got up, got my shit and fucking left. Got on the next train back home.


I didn't really realize how much it affected me, just sort of blew it off in the manly 'no emotions' way and put it down as a shitty experience. But I have to admit I felt quite emotional typing this, and I tried jerking off last night and I couldn't even get an erection, I'm honestly really fucked up about this! Especially because I am seeing another woman and I really like her, I'm embarassed, ashamed, afraid, sad, I don't even know.

I don't know if this is the right place for this but I discovered this reddit &amp; decided I would post it. I haven't told anyone I know, but I really wanted to share it &amp; this is essentially a throw away account. Sorry if this is badly written/hard to read. 


Edit: Update

Since a lot of people have said/asked/mentioned in the comments here are the answers 

* I will be getting an STI test.
* I found my wallet with nothing missing, it was with my shirt.
* I am going to look for a local female therapist that I 'click' with.
* I will seriously consider contacting the police.

1348781853.0,484,self.MensRights,10l2b8,"TIL in Ireland, teenagers can go to prison for having consensual sex. But only if they're male.",MechPlasma,599,115,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/10l2b8/til_in_ireland_teenagers_can_go_to_prison_for/,"http://www.independent.ie/national-news/courts/man-spared-jail-in-romeo-case-3172547.html

Yes, no tricks or anything. A 15 year old boy got sentenced to prison for having perfectly consensual sex with a girl the same age. There really is a law saying all teenage sex is male-on-female rape. And it was made in 2006.

EDIT: The law in question is ""A female child under the age of 17 years shall not be guilty of [statutory rape] by reason only of her engaging in an act of sexual intercourse."" http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/acts/2006/a1506.pdf

...

Okay, everything I said was entirely true, but it's not really fair. So backstory: in 2006, after realising that their statutory rape laws from 1935 (I think) were really really outdated, they rushed out a new one. Turns out one of the things the new act introduced was that male teenagers could be charged for statutory rape, but female teenagers could *not*.

Whoops.

Mind you, Ireland is actually a very well-informed country, so when someone was actually charged with it, *everyone* in the country knew about it! There was a massive public outrage. Which is why I *thought* the issue would be handled without the kid actually getting punished for it.

Well, I guess it was kinda put on hold or something, and by last July the Supreme Court finally got around to deciding if the law should be overturned. They found that, while the law was most definitely sexist, it wasn't actually un-constitutional - and therefore, it couldn't be removed, it could only be replaced by new laws. Which the lawmakers didn't do because I Don't Know.

So now he finally went on trial, and found guilty. Law mandates a prison sentence. Then the judge goes ""I don't want to"", and gives him the minimal punishment possible - 6 month jail but suspended for a year, and isn't registered as a sex offender.

And then, when someone here mentioned an old sexist rape law in California, I got reminded of this and decided to see how it actually went. Then I got angry. Then I posted it here. Hello!

...

So yes. I still don't think it's something to... *worry* about, since the public was really bloody clear that this is not okay, I do think it'll be fixed soon, and nobody else has been charged in the 6 years since it was introduced. But a prison sentence IS a prison sentence.

So the next time someone tries to tell you about how all those ridiculously sexist rape laws don't exist anymore, tell them Ireland says hi!

...and then tell them England does too. Because despite how utterly ridiculous this law is, it's *still* not as horribly sexist as England's rape laws! ...dang.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,1348858591.0,,,True,t3_10l2b8,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/10l2b8/til_in_ireland_teenagers_can_go_to_prison_for/,

We went out to the Bay (we live in San Francisco) and found an awesome, secluded spot by the water that pretty much afforded a front-row seat. We sat in awe of the fireworks and sipped on a bottle of Brandy, and all in all it was a pretty decent night.

We fought the throngs of people to get back to the subway, waited in line for a ticket machine that didn't work, and then eventually got on the bus home. Unfortunately it wasn't the exact bus line we needed to get all the way home, so we took the next closest one and ended up walking the last 15~ minutes of the trip.

As we walked a little further we caught up to someone walking ahead of us who appeared to be smoking a cigarette. Having a sufficient buzz from drinking some Brandy I thought, ""Boy, I'd *love* a smoke about now..."" Since I have pretty poor eyesight and it was dark, I couldn't really make out the person who was now about 20 feet in front of us, so I called out, ""Excuse me sir or madam, but could I buy a cigarette from you?"" She responded with, ""I could call 911!""

I was shocked and really taken aback. First of all, this happened in a pretty safe neighborhood of San Francisco. Secondly, I asked as politely as I could, and I probably even sounded like a goofball since I was a little drunk, but I was in NO WAY threatening. Yet she responded with threatening to call the cops on me for asking her a question that I'd ask anyone under the circumstances! What. The. Fuck?!

At that point we crossed the street and were now walking parallel to her, though she was on the other side of the street and a bit ahead of us. I let my emotions get the best of me and not one to take anyone's shit, I shouted, ""What the fuck is wrong with you? How paranoid are you? People like you are what's wrong with this city!"" or something along those lines. Maybe it was stupid of me, but I was insulted that her first assumption was that I was a rapist because I asked her for a cigarette. How dare she compare me to such monsters when I've never done anything like that?

To me, this moment punctuated every worst suspicion I had about the women living in SF. I've lived here for 8 years but when I first moved in I noticed that the women here seemed extremely closed off and unapproachable. After seeing some of the riff raff in the city saying harassing things to women I had an understanding of why, but I never thought that I would be assumed to be among those types of people.

My roommate and I arrived home, and I said, ""I don't feel comfortable with this woman knowing where we live and seeing us go in here."" Thinking on my feet, I realized we should go into the other apartment door next to ours, since we had a key for that hallway since it's where both apartments keep their trash. We went inside and waited for her to pass.

Here's the best part: While standing there waiting, we heard her stop right outside the door on the phone with the police, talking about some men she felt threatened by who shouted at her, ""I don't know what they said, but they were shouting something at me,"" she told them. My roommate was completely silent during this whole ordeal. ""I'm afraid because I feel like they could be right behind me,"" she continued. I resisted the urge to fling the door open and confront her.

After giving the police the address of where she thought we were, she went on her way and we waited a couple more minutes before ducking out and going into our own apartment. That was about 20 minutes ago when I started writing this.

1338734923.0,480,self.MensRights,uimi6,North Carolina's law mandating that an assault on a female is a more serious offense than an assault on a male is not consonant with modern notions of gender equality,PierceHarlan,613,133,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/uimi6/north_carolinas_law_mandating_that_an_assault_on/,"In North Carolina, if an assault is committed against a male, the perpetrator (whether male or female) is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.  But if a male over 18 years of age commits an assault on a female, it is a Class A1 misdemeanor (the same classification as when a person inflicts serious injury upon another person or uses a deadly weapon). N.C. Gen. Stat. § 14-33.  This difference in classification means that male defendants who assault females receive greater sentences than defendants of either gender who assault males.

The courts have held this statute constitutional because it serves an important governmental objective (protecting persons more likely to suffer greater injury due to size and physical strength) and that it does deny males equal protection of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

While appreciating the general physical difference in size and strength between men and women, this generality has innumerable exceptions. Institutionalizing a sweeping gender generality as a matter of state policy, and applying it across the board whether or not it actually applies in a given case, does not seem consonant with modern notions of gender equality.

Yep: He's a man. He is against positive discrimination (Affirmative action) initiatives in the EU, and is working to put more male students in classrooms. He backed our 2007 change in custody laws, creating more equality in Danish family court. He also wants to change laws that prevent fathers from taking the same parental leave as mothers.

He said in an interview two months ago that the lack of focus on male victims of domestic violence is worrying. He would know about this, because he has an education in mediating conflicts, and another education as a social worker. He wrote an article last year, about how we need more focus on *men* in equality debates, because - and I translate from the article: 

&gt;""It's not only girls and women who experience being limited, by stereotypical prejudices associated with their gender. Men and boys experience this too, if not even more so. Just see how a lot of men don't take parental leave, because they know their collegues will look down on them, because 'real men don't take parental leave'. Or what about the boys that live in an anti-school culture, because 'real boys' don't use their time doing homework? We are in the middle of an evolution in gender politics; we're going from saying that yes; inequalities affect men as well as women. But more than that, we're actually starting to do something about it. [...] We need to broaden our perspectives and look at the issues men and boys face. For example, we know that men drink more than women, smoke more, commit suicide more often, are more often homeless, are more overweight, they eat less healthy, have a lower education, have a much higher risk of dying than women across all ages, and they live four years shorter than women on average!"".

Oh, and I'm not done yet. Did I mention that he's a church minister as well as a minister for equality? Yup. He was the man who made gay marriages legal, and he has been nominated politician of the year multiple times by the Danish LBGT community. He is also the first minister in Denmark with a non-european background.

1339699855.0,480,self.MensRights,v22oj,I said circumcision is equivocal to female genital mutilation in my college class. uh oh.,shmittywerber,665,185,212,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/v22oj/i_said_circumcision_is_equivocal_to_female/,"Sitting in a class at a University of California on political and moral philosophy. Discussing Nussbaum's ""The Case of Female Genital Mutilation."" I drew a parallel between circumcision and female genital mutilation. Received some glares, some got visibly angry.

I argued:

Both remove choice from person it is being performed on, for aesthetic, cultural, or religious reasons

Both inhibit sexual pleasure and have a high risk for complication if performed in a non sanitary environment. 

Both have opened gateways for sexual predators or religious zealots to abuse power. (EDIT: I now realize the evidence behind the sexual predator claim is shaky. I will refrain from using it in the future unless i acquire more info.)

I swear, I thought I was going to be exiled, yelled at, everything. However, by calmly and firmly arguing my position, the class actually ADOPTED my point as a huge argument against the author! Even the Women's Studies major who was yelling at me earlier called it ""the best argument why Americans can't forcefully intervene on this issue."" I took a chance, a very risky one, at a University of  heavy handed feminism and while discussing a feminist topic.

Thank you so much MR for helping me prepare my arguments, provide evidence, and calmly provide reasoning for these arguments. I feel that I changed people's minds in a way that made them really think about the issue. 

Now to address the wage gap and divorce courts! Well... maybe later.

EDIT: Regarding the feminist arguing in my class: i consider yelling to be raising your voice, appealing to emotion, and attempting to downplay the issue of circumcision by saying ""well, female genital MUTILATION has mutilation right in the name!"" She was open minded to the issue, so I was pleasantly surprised.

This whole her+ the courts vs me. Its insurmountable. I have tried EVERY conceivable way to be amicable with this woman regarding our child (HER child as she sees it). It pains me to say/ type this but i already know for certain. I will NEVER get to know my daughter.

I will never get to know my daughter, yet despite this fact I am on the verge of homelessness. My stomach knows the rumble of hunger all too well. I have lost so much weight because of this that I'm not even recognizable next to photos from as recent as 5 years ago (I'm 27 btw). Why am I in this sad, pathetic state? Because of the state of texas attorney general Gregg Abbot and my ex wife. I am an indentured servant to a woman I was married too for a brief amount of time ( 3 years). Our daughter is now 4 years old and I've only seen her twice.

I had a heated argument with my ex-bitch (sorry I just cant stand her) last night which ending up making me so mad, i punch several wholes in my apartment's dry wall. 

This woman had the GALL to tell me that HER father (who is a drug addicted ex-con who lives with HIS mother and he's in his 50s) is a better male role model for our daughter than I am. Despite the fact that I've never touched drugs and I am a certified Biomedical tech who at one time, could afford a decent living. When she uttered those words I swear to god I wanted to fucking kick her teeth in. I'd never act on it, thats just how bad she pissed me off.

Now to the point of this post. I'm paying nearly 70% of my check in child support based solely off the fact of what I ""should"" be making. Never mind the fact that I have rent, bills, and a life of my own i must pay for. I've tried to get it adjusted with no avail. I had to take a bereavement leave because my dad passed and so i fell behind 1 month in arrears. My ex promptly did her best to get me locked up, I was almost fired from my job because of it. 

I'm going through all this for a child who I've only been able to see 2 fucking times ( i have no visitation rights).  It has left me hopeless, angry, depressed, and bitter. And I am just fucking DONE with it all. Its been going on too long.


Lets see them collect child support from a corpse............

She willingly moved into the living room. Since our break up she has insisted that I have to leave the house within 30 days. I have been on the hunt but nothing suitable has come up. I was crushed by a van last Spring and can't walk far so I'm forced to live close to public trans and also make very little money. Regardless, she continued to ridicule my every move and continuously threatened to call the land lord and lie about my behavior in order to have me evicted. 

We have dealt with the police in the past. In early December she choked, scratched, and threatened to kill me in my sleep. In order to protect herself she called the police and claimed I had assaulted her. The police arrived, saw my injuries, asked if I'd like to press charges (I didn't), and then just dropped the whole thing given my peaceful demeanor and her lack of evidence. 

Last night I came home to make dinner for myself and a friend. One thing led to another and she had throw my dinner down the drain and was beating my television with a frying pan. I blocked my room. She called the police and then hit me with the pan on the shoulder. Our neighbor, a Latino mother, asked my ex if she should lie to the cops and tell them she saw me beating her. She then offered to have her children jump me the next time they saw me on the street. My ex agreed and asked her to do both of those. 

The police came and spoke with my ex. I was in the kitchen, head in hands, and never heard them arrive. She left to get an emergency eviction notice. I called the police back to my house and told them what actually happened. They were told I was an alcoholic and had smashed her head against a wall and thrown her down the stairs of which I had done neither. 

The next thing I know there is a PFA on my bed and I can not enter my own house without a police escort. There is not one scratch on my ex and I have never hit her. I have never felt so low and betrayed. I am scared for my life. I have a pair of broken glasses, 4 broken phones, and a smashed guitar that I will be taking to court Friday as evidence against my ex but I feel like it won't hold up against her cute face and obscene lies. I never thought it would happen to me. I never thought being a man would cause me so much trouble. 

**tl; dr** Ex girlfriend threatened to lie to cops about me abusing her and then did. Now I am couch surfing. 

**Update:** I've avoided all contact with her and have places lined up for each night of this week, friends are great. I'm scheduled to get an EMG on my foot tomorrow. The long walks to and from the subway each day are starting to do some damage. I plan on mentioning this at the hearing on Friday @ 1. Thanks for all the advice and kind words. 

**Update:** She just texted me. ""Willing to not go through with the pfa if you agree to move out."" I'm assuming she would want me to move immediately. I do not have the money to pay for a truck. I do not have the money to pay for the deposit on a new room even if I were able to find a suitable one. I also don't think I should be forced out of the house so she can drop phony charges against me? Thoughts? 

**2/1 Update:** The judge granted a continuation due to her graduation from college. The new hearing date is 2/13. The good news is that I have been given permission to enter the property without police supervision! I was not able to speak with the judge. The judge's assistant told me to bring any documented evidence that will work in my favor with me next time. I plan on bringing photos and receipts for the damaged property. I do have a witness from an event in August that may come forward. My ex snapped my phone and clocked me in the face in front of a whole van of people while we were driving to Chicago. I did not respond violently. Things are looking on the up. I haven't entered the house yet but I plan on doing so this weekend once her family leaves and the graduation celebration dies down.

Accountability and responsibility – On a personal perspec, as a woman I abhor being viewed as weak/passive/suffering from false consciousness etc. This subreddit upholds (indeed insists) on woman as a strong and equal creature.
2.	Asking tough questions – the feminist subreddits, I find, stay away from the hard queries. The questions of accountability, the queries into womans perceived weakness and how to challenge and over come it.
3.	Gender Dynamic – 1960’s feminism purported a dynamic of equality between the genders, modern feminism (as is expressed on the fem subreddits) want more than equality. Also, as a mother of a son, the male relative aspect is completely disregarded.
4.	Patriarchy – this word is banded about with a belief that it is a relavant concept, we have had 50+ years of a feminist society in the western world, it is no longer the ‘rule of the father’ (although I do believe that we are living with the history of an andocentric society).
5.	Insular - Inability to challenge/interact with MRA stances and resorting to offensive language. 

Now, you could argue that Im not a feminist (it has been queried often) and that Im an egalitarian person -  but that is just semantics. I think feminism should return to its belief of woman as a strong creature , and not the victim as is often inferred on the fem subreddit. I think it should interact with the opposite gender ‘ideology’ (MRA). And I very strongly believe it should ask the hard questions in stead of shying away from them as it so often does.

----------

**New feminist rape definition:**

Consensual sex is defined as sex that is free from acts of coercion, manipulation, or abuse, but consensual sex is an oxymoronic term; without consent, the act of sex isn’t really sex at all.  It is assault.

Before I engaged in a sexual relationship with my last boyfriend, William*, I made the terms for my consent very clear:  if we were going to become sexually involved, it had to be within the context of strict monogamy. 

We didn’t officially consummate the relationship until about a month had passed, but, as I came to find out about fifteen months later, he had begun drinking, doing drugs, and having frequent and unprotected sex with other people behind my back.

I was rendered completely helpless against his intentional deceptions.  Because of his lies, I was powerless to protect myself from his reckless endangerment of my health and well being.  I entered into a relationship with him under an agreement of mutual honesty and strict monogamy.  I wouldn’t have been with him under any other circumstances, and he knew it.  And yet, he went to great lengths to keep me around.  In addition to all of the mental manipulations described above, he also acted the part of the devoted, loving boyfriend by bringing me into his life with his family; I was invited to Sunday dinners, major holidays, and get-togethers with his grandparents.  He presented me to them as if I were his intended.  He even went so far in playing the role of the dedicated boyfriend that he participated in couple’s therapy with me—his way of proving to me how committed he was to making it work.  He even told me that he wanted to marry me.  Multiple times.

These situations call for a reevaluation of the law.  We must consider what protections ought to be in place for the victims of these sneaky, slithery, crimes.  This is a matter of bodily integrity, sexual autonomy, and personal safety.  William’s use of deception and manipulation to obtain sexual favors is a violation, and it is abusive.  He robs his victims of their freedom of choice and makes himself the overlord of what should be their autonomy, in every possible way.

We cannot let this continue, because no consent = rape.  Period.

EDIT:  By popular demand, [here is a link to a screenshot of the new definition](http://i.imgur.com/YWFAfLc.jpg). The screenshot is a composite compilation of the parts that have to do with a new definition of rape, skipping the tearful melodrama that characterizes all posts on that feminist site.

2 years ago, I was living with my wife of 10 years and our 2 kids in a NYC brownstone. A new tenant moved into an apartment in an adjoining building – a single woman and her 3 daughters (living crammed into a tiny 1 bedroom apartment). Within months, this new family was a fixture in our home. So much so that I finally asked if we could establish some boundaries between our family and theirs. Instead, my wife informed me that she and the neighbor were in love and I was the one who needed to leave the home.

I begged my wife to try and work on the marriage, but she refused. I then reminded her that we barely had enough money for one household in NYC, let alone 2  (she had always refused to work). She said that the lack of money was my problem, not hers. So, we started divorce proceedings.

While we worked on negotiating a settlement, she move in with her lover. Three months later, we had hammered out a (very generous)  agreement whereby she would get to live in our brownstone for 2 years at which time we would sell it and split the equity. The agreement stipulated that her lover would NOT be permitted to live in my home (as the family therapist had warned us both how confusing that would be for our kids).

The day before we were supposed to sign the agreement, I came home (at this point, I was still the one living in the building) and found my wife taking apart my belongings, and moving herself back into the residence. I explained that I wasn't moving until the agreement had been signed. She looked at me, smiled, and said ""wanna bet? You just assaulted me and I'm calling the police.""

I thought she was joking or bluffing, but sure enough, she dialed 911 and reported an assault. The police came and she showed them a small red mark on her knee (the sort you might get from bumping your leg against a wall). The police were apologetic but they explained that they were forbidden to dismiss any complaint involving domestic violence. With that, they arrested me and I spent the next 36 hours in jail.

A condition of my release was an automatic order of protection which was granted her, effectively barring me from my own home. Once free, my lawyer informed me that my ex had fired her lawyer and hired a new attorney who immediately yanked the negotiated settlement off the table. I was also told that she would not permit me to see my children (despite the fact that I had them 50% of the time before this incident). We proceeded to go to trial.

Fast forward 6 months: My ex, of course, immediately moved her lover and family into my home (my 10 year old son is now actually sharing a room with her lover's 10 year old daughter). My lawyer was sure the judge would slam her for this outrageous action but the judge just said to me, ""it's almost 2013, get over it.""

The criminal matter won't go away. I even took a polygraph test and passed it with flying colors. She of course refused to take one. This did not sway the district attorneys office to drop the charges. I then had the family therapist write a letter on my behalf stating that he didn't believe I was capable of acting violently towards my wife, and moreover, he believed that she was very capable of lying to manipulate the situation. This also did not make any difference. That trial is scheduled for February.

I am now sleeping on a friend's pull-out couch while she sleeps with her lover in my old bed.

I have spent over $50K in legal fees. And because she always refused to work, I was just ordered to start paying spousal support which I can no longer afford. I may actually go to jail for non-payment if I can't come up with the money. 

There is no recourse. There is no hope.

I was with friends and didn't want to ruin everyone 's good time so I allowed her to search my bag. She made me take out my jacket from the bag and looked in. She then asked me what is my small case and I said my medication. She then made me open the case to prove it was medication in front of all the others in line and standing around. I just wanted to share this experience with you all. I was thinking about going back and having my girlfriend carry my same bag to see what happens.  I know this is a small thing and that is why I didn't make a big deal at the theater but these everyday double standards just start to get annoying. Hope everyone is having a great day, I really enjoy the support this sub reddit offers men. Thanks for reading.

I don't care if he has 3 items and I have 30... I'm a woman. He needs to respect me! I'm an independent woman, but I have a vag, so men should let me go, no questions asked. Whatever happened to chivalry?""

So I posted back that she is what's wrong with society. We had an exchange, and I ended it with ""I refuse to respect you just because you have a vagina. That thing down there isn't a pass for you to act like a complete bitch and get away with it. Respect is earned and based on that you aren't deserving of any respect. His time is just as important as yours is and if you want to get out of the store faster, get there sooner. Quit being a whiny little princess and grow up.""

As soon as I did this I lost 30 friends immediately. I woke up to literally 12 angry messages about what a chauvinist pig I am and this is why I'm single, yada yada yada. 

So boys, what say you on this matter. I don't regret what I said for one moment. What is your opinion on this one?

Virgin shaming is great!""",OuiCrudites,638,180,449,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15mkop/feminists_and_manginas_slut_shaming_is_bad_virgin/,"A very standard rhetorical tactic of feminists, when pointing out sexism against women, will note the double standards on promiscuous men and women. In short, ""A man who has a lot of sex is regarded as a stud, but a woman who has a lot of sex is regarded as a slut."" 

I think this argument has some merit. I believe that consenting adults should basically be able to do what they want with their own bodies, as long as they don't infringe on the rights of others. And I don't shame men or women for having a lot of sex. Furthermore, I think being an actual slut, i.e. a sex worker, is fine as long as no one is being forced into it. 

Where the argument runs out of gas to me, is when feminists are unwilling to admit their complicity in demonizing sexually successful men. Or when they are unwilling to admit that women slut shame other women as much as men.

But on the other hand, how many times has the typical outspoken male been virgin-shamed by a feminist, a mangina, or a white knight? I've spoken on men's issues for 17 years now and it's happened to me hundreds of times. Examples of virgin shaming are as follows:

""You must be a 40-year old virgin living in your mother's basement.""

""You must hate women because no woman would ever have sex with you.""

""You're only avoiding dating because no woman would ever have you anyway.""

""Maybe if you weren't such a misogynist asshole, you'd be able to get laid and find out that women aren't so bad.""

So in other words, feminists are taking advantage of society's perception that male attractiveness to women = male worth as a human being, and using it as a shaming tactic. Because they know that many men DO determine their self-worth based on their purported attractiveness to women, and they want to leverage that to shame men back into obeying Feminist dogma. In short, ""You are useless to women as a sex object.""

Frankly, I don't think this tactic is very effective on any man who is even slightly self-aware. First of all, even if a man is a virgin, what's the problem with that? Doesn't make him any less of a human being. 

Second of all, most men that I'm aware of who are outspoken on men's issues are VERY experienced with women. Speaking personally, I've lived with two women, almost marrying one of them. I had two other long term relationships besides that. I've had several more short-term relationships with women. And I've had several interactions that were about nothing more than casual sex. I usually have at least a few women interested in dating me at any given time, and I have female friends. There's really no aspect of female behavior that i find mystifying or unknowable anymore.

So ultimately, virgin-shaming is just another piece of evidence that our opposition is a bunch of craven, mentally-deficient hypocrites. And I encourage everyone to use the example of ""virgin shaming"" when anyone whines about slut-shaming or claims that feminists don't regard men as sex objects.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_15mkop,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/15mkop/feminists_and_manginas_slut_shaming_is_bad_virgin/,

Currently, the mother not only has some control over her pregnancy and the possible future of her child, she also has some degree of control over the father's future as well. I think there's an imbalance currently and while my suggestion may have undesirable consequences I certainly think it's something worth discussing.

One of the most important aspects of a fair trial is weighing the evidence and coming to a decision based on that evidence. It is the EXACT same thing for rape.

Now, in rape cases it is always the man's story vs the woman's story, so ANY evidence that points to the accuracy of either story should be weighed extremely heavily towards the credibility of each party and ultimately who we should believe.

I am a woman who has been lurking on your reddit for a while. I just wanted to let you know that you have the backing of women; maybe not a lot of us, but I know that there are at least three: myself and two friends.

It started when I was a little girl. I saw my mother verbally abuse my father. She would pick fights with him for no reason other than to back him into a corner. She called him horrible names and even hit him a few times. She didn't work; my father supported us alone as a contractor. This happened for years and years. 

Eventually, when I was fifteen, I asked my father why he didn't just hit back or leave. He told me that the world was a complicated place, far more complicated than a fifteen year old could understand. He said that if he hit her back, he would put in a jail for a very long time. My mother would divorce him. He would have to pay child support. I expressed my concern of the unfairness; why couldn't he just say my mother was hitting him? He explained that a woman's tears are the gears for this world.

I watched as my brother was harassed in school by girls for being overweight. I watched them hit him in school and the teachers not do anything about it because he was a guy. I heard him cry in the bedroom one night and my mother burst him and tell him to ""man up"" and stop crying. My brother was never the same since that day; we share the same feeling towards women.

I know this is a sanctuary for men, and I hope you don't mind a woman being in here. I really just wanted to express how happy I am that men are taking a stand against the oppression of women. My father always told me that life worked like a pendulum. It swings too far one way (the extremist nature of men and their abuse and misuse of women) and that the pendulum swings too far the other way (where we are now, with women treating men the same way they were treated). He said it's our responsibility to grab that pendulum and stop it from swinging.

I'm 22 years old and married. I love and respect my husband. I don't place stereotypes on him; I don't expect him to be stupid, drunk, violent, lazy, or consume his life with naked girls and sports. Shockingly (/sarcasm), he isn't like that! We, as an entire society, need to stop putting these vicious stereotypes on people. I hate the way the media portrays men as drunken fratboys; I hate the way they show them as violent, testosterone nutcases; I hate that in sitcoms, the guy is always stupid and lazy and the woman is the only one in the family that anyone can count on.

I hate even more the social hypocrises that occur with men in our justice system. I watched first hand as my cousin gained full custody of her son--she was a convicted heroin and cocaine user, the father was clean. She was given child support from the father, as well as welfare. She doesn't work; she sits at home and gets drunk while the state and the baby's father do everything. Every time I express how I feel, my family slams me down. My father and brother are the only rational people in the whole picture.

I don't know why I posted this. I guess I was just tired of all the bullshit in this world. Men have it so hard in this world and I will take my part, when I have children, to try to change this world. I'm sorry for all the bullshit you guys have to go through.

It has subsequently been edited several times by two users.

Firstly, an anonymous user [added a big warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State_of_Louisiana_v._Frisard&amp;diff=505986027&amp;oldid=441938811) saying that the neutrality of the article was disputed.  According to [Wikipedia's rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NPOV_dispute#How_to_initiate_an_NPOV_debate), you are supposed to explain why you are disputing the neutrality on the talk page, but this user did not do so.  Looking at [their user page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/173.173.10.112), we can see that the only other change they've made on Wikipedia is to [remove any mention of anti-male controversies associated with International Women's Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Women%27s_Day&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=505383818), which was [reverted the same day](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=International_Women%27s_Day&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=505383818) by somebody calling it vandalism.

Then the user [Countered](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Countered), a self-described feminist, [edits the page to remove a reference to the fact that a condom was used](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State_of_Louisiana_v._Frisard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=505986996) with the log message ""Edited for bias"".  They then [added a big warning](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=State_of_Louisiana_v._Frisard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=505987518) saying that the article's factual accuracy is disputed.

They further edited the talk page.  Apparently [the reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:State_of_Louisiana_v._Frisard&amp;diff=505986469&amp;oldid=494524190) for the neutrality warning in Countered's eyes is *""The article comes off as if it was determined that the plaintiff did something illegal. Can we show evidence it should be written in such a negative way?""*  Additionally, [the reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:State_of_Louisiana_v._Frisard&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=505987137) for disputing the factual accuracy... well, there wasn't a reason.  They are just asking the question *""Do the citations meet the criteria for a Wikipedia article?""*.

Looking at this person's [contributions page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Countered) reveals they have [repeatedly](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Misandry&amp;diff=next&amp;oldid=502680218) been [admonished for editing pages to say that the very concept of misandry is anti-feminist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ebikeguy#Misandry), they have [edited the page on misandry to remove a sentence contrasting it to misogyny](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Misandry&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=489873167), they have [edited the intro to Men's Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Portal:Men%27s_rights/Intro&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=503889609) to change a description of masculism from ""a counterpart to feminism"" to ""argues for male dominance"", [blaming the rise in domestic violence against men on 20th century warfare](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Violence_against_men&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=489874068), and other petty vandalism of similar sorts.

It only helps our enemies.,EvilPundit,598,153,449,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1fmbb8/mras_really_should_cut_down_on_namecalling_it/,"While this issue is often raised by concern trolls, it really is a problem - though not for the reasons feminists give.

Calling a woman a bitch, or a slut, or making fun of her weight is neither sexist nor oppressive. However, it *is* rude and counter-productive.

Rudeness and anger in an argument cedes the moral high ground to your opponent. The goal of arguing with a feminist should not be to make them feel bad, or to change their mind - but to *influence the audience*.

For every person who posts on the Internet, there are a hundred passively observing. It is these people to whom you should really be talking, even though you're addressing someone else.

In an argument, the side that stays cool, rational and fact-based looks a lot better in the long term. The side that yells, insults, and puts down its opponent may gain a cheer squad, but ultimately it's far less convincing.

The other main reason to avoid name-calling is that it plays into the feminists' narrative. 

They want to depict the MRM as angry, abusive and potentially violent. Angry and abusive words give them fuel for this false portrayal, and draw attention away from calm, rational arguments.

TL;DR: If we want to win, we should stay calm and cool.

""I oppose the proposal to make rape laws gender neutral. There is physicality in the definition of rape, there is use of power and the victim has a stigma attached to her. If made gender-neutral, rape laws will not have the deterrence value and it will make it more complicated for judges in court,"" Agnes said.

Delhi advocate Vrinda Grover said, ""Why should rape laws be gender-neutral? That would be making a mockery of what is actually happening in the country. There are no instances of women raping men. I don't think men are facing serious sexual violence as women. Consider the brutality and intensity of sexual violence against women. Hope the home minister does not put out a bill that delays or obfuscates discussions on the issue.""

----

http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cabinet-approves-law-to-make-rape-genderneutral/272357-3.html

The Union Cabinet on Thursday approved a proposal making rape a gender-neutral offence, under which the word 'rape' would be replaced by the phrase 'sexual assault'.


[..]


The amendment would expand the definition so that cases of sexual assault where the victims are male would also fall under the same law along with cases where the victims were women. 

At present, the offence is defined under section 375 of the Indian Penal Code as per which a man is said to commit 'rape' in case he has sexual intercourse with a woman against her will.

So, without dumping my life story here before the TL;DR post, two ex girlfriends ago I was in an abusive relationship that opened my eyes to the lack of Men's Rights/equality in so many parts of our society. Said previous ex girlfriend had emotionally abused me, told me I would never be better than her and crap, tried to make me feel like I would amount to nothing in life, and I was only good for her for sex. It had left a huge scar that took over a year to feel any real recovery from, and now I'm finally getting close to closing that scar up.

Now, I'm finally getting my crap back together in school after this ordeal, as I had taken a year off to work to pay bills, and some desired recovery time from high school BS. I am currently 19 now working on my last year of high school, and am attending an alternative high school that takes in many people with drug abuse, homelessness, abusive families/relationships and just lazy kids.

---

I'm in a class period called ""Healthy Self"", and last week we had a guest speaker present a 3 day abusive relationship seminar for the class. There are only about four of us in the class, and we all come from different backgrounds. This teacher had come from a very recently built high school on another side of town, and boasts a fairly large student base of rich kids, and most of them are girls.

We had an overview of what the seminar was going to be about, and that was abusive relationships. I was already feeling pretty uncomfortable about this, seeing as how the subject still hurts quite a bit.


When she showed up, it went just as 'well' as I had expected. She shows up, and starts handing out papers we need to overview as a class about abusive relationships, and it all targeted men, ""Emotional Abuse: He will mostly try and threaten you, tell you that he loves you and that he's only doing things for you. He will get angry when you hang out with friends that are guys... etc"" and another, ""Physical abuse: When a man hits a woman, [that's no good](http://fc04.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/158/b/f/Sonic_Sez_That__s_No_Good_by_jared811111.jpg)."" &lt; although not word for word, I really stopped paying attention to the whole paper at this point.

I was pretty livid at the end of day one. She said she was going to cover all forms of abuse in a video, so I was expecting to see at least something on both sides. But no, of course not, after all it's supposed to be EDUCATIONAL.

The video went over the extremes of all of the abuse in the relationship as a Junior in Highschool dating a Freshman. It painted him out like one would paint out a rapist or pedophile, which in education, I can understand why they would show the extremes to paint a picture of what you don't want. Overall, it was correct in it's portrayal of what a stereotypical abusive relationship was, and I was uncomfortable watching as it tried to paint all men being like this at some point.

After the video was over, the teacher asked what his problems were, and how could she have avoided this.

I immediately spoke up. If there was actually some communication from both parties, (seeing as he was actually being rational in the beginning by the fact that he was trying to communicate), that a lot of the problems could have been avoided if she tried to communicate back, and could have tried to be more constructive. The teacher immediately blew me off, saying that ""it wasn't the point of the video"" and asked the only female in the classroom what her views on it were, and what she would have done to get out of the situation. However, said teacher forgets that this is a student body of people who had gone through hell and back. A lot of them didn't live with their parents, didn't have money, and a few even had kids already. She spoke up that I was correct about the communication, and would have talked to him about his feelings from the start if she noticed signs that he would potentially become abusive, and see what was best for the both of them from there. The teacher got a little angry as her ""point"" was getting completely derailed, and said we would touch base on it a little more the next day, and actually gave me an informational sheet, ""So you can look over, since I felt you didn't understand what the video was trying to get across.""
I left the classroom a little livid, but stopped caring about 5 steps out of the door.

---

I didn't show up the next day specifically so I wouldn't have to deal with her preaching a bit more.

---

I show up the next day for the final session of the seminar. We started overviewing problems that stretched into more family and friendship relationships.
She handed out another paper full of one sided crap. I chose to fill it out with the most broad/vague topics as I could that would cause abuse in relationships, though more problems that both male and females would encounter in a relationship rather than one or the other. After filling it out, we went around the circle speaking openly about what he had filled in. When it was my turn to speak, I told her that I only chose broad examples for both parties, seeing as the paper only singled out females.. AGAIN. When I mentioned that, she said, ""Well, the class is about abusive relationships. I mean, sure, there are some guys who get 'abused' (she fucking did quotation marks and rolled her eyes as she said it) but, (get's all smart ass mode to say this) statistics show that 98% of abuse comes from the male party involved, and only 2% of men actually have probable cause to admit they've been ABUSED.""

Then, she fucking said something I could never forgive any bigotry ridden... person... of saying..
""And besides, if we actually GOT 100 men in a room, and asked if they had been abused, do you actually think that two people would stand up, and have GOOD REASON to accuse someone of abusing them? Hardly..""

She was just about to continue spewing her crap, when I stood up, tears streaking down my completely livid red face, and said ""Well, I will have you know for your god damn statistics that I am one of those 2%, and I've been seeking counseling from this man, *points to counselor* for the past year for my emotional repression and grief."" She kind of just looked dumbstruck with her mouth open a little. Trembling, I grabbed my things, and proceeded to say, ""Thank you, but I know when my time and respect is being wasted by another, and I'm extremely uncomfortable being in the same room as you right now."" and left the classroom.

The counselor who I've been seeing is actually the main teacher in the class. He didn't contribute any of the seminar course work, so I know he didn't share many of her views. I wasn't given any more course work, and wasn't talked to about leaving the class prematurely.

After being abused by family members, friends, and partners, I'm fucking done with this shit, and I know I'm not ever returning to public/community education after what I've experienced throughout my stint in public education. I'm tired of being looked down upon as always the instigator, and never the possible victim.

This may be why she's single, but I have no intention of getting to know this person to find out.

**TL;DR A stuck up, well educated and 'well versed in statistics' teacher hosts a three day seminar on why boys are potentially abusive time bombs in high school, paints us having no experience in the pains and hardships of being on the receiving end of an abusive relationship, and shows no respect for those looking to portray hope for gender equality in a relationship.

I'm circumcised, and I figured ""who cares"" and ""might as well"" and ""I don't want him to feel weird if he and I are different.""

As we got closer to the due date, I started to do a little more research about circumcision in general, with the mindset of ""how can I justify to myself having my son circumcised.""  I tried to make myself comfortable with this decision.

I came across a good number of resources touting the health benefits of circumcision (i.e., hygiene, lower chance of transmitting some diseases) and thought that that was evidence enough, and told my wife we should have him circumcised.

But then I read some more Reddit links, comments, etc., and came to an important realization:  when it comes to doing pretty much anything (especially irreversible medical procedures), it is intellectually dishonest to make ""yes"" the default choice.

My original thought process was ""I should have him circumcised unless I can find overwhelming evidence against.""  It wasn't until reading a bunch of Reddit, watching ""Cut"" and a 15 minute video of an actual circumcision, and doing some thinking that I realized my folly.  The correct answer is, of course, ""I should not have him circumcised unless I can find overwhelming evidence for it.""  This, naturally, I couldn't do.

As an atheist, I have no religious reasons for doing this.  Also, as no medical establishment endorses the procedure, I have no medical reasons for doing this.  Finally, as a simple explanation can clarify the difference between him and me, and more and more boys are not having the procedure done these days, I have no social reason for doing this.

So two things.   First, thanks for the great community and the logical arguments - you've saved at least one man's penis from circumcision.  Second, for any other new fathers out there, please realize that only faced with overwhelming evidence for circumcision should you choose the procedure.

tl;dr:  Thought I had to prove the case against circumcision, realized I had to prove the case for it to have it done, cancelled the procedure.  Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_dy598,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/dy598/thanks_to_you_reddit_i_canceled_my_sons/,

The person giving the class was a man, and it was clear that he was talking to the men in the class when he went over the ""rules"". 

Basically, he said if you obey the following guidelines, you won't have to worry about a sexual harassment lawsuit or dismissal for inappropriate conduct:

1. Don't make eye contact with the opposite sex... while walking down the halls, in the break rooms, etc. (He cited a man who got fired because a woman thought he was ""leering at her"" when she walked down the halls)

2. Don't tell ANY jokes, no matter how clean you think they are. There is always someone listening who will take it out of context and report you.

3. Never make physical contact.. that includes pats on the back for a job well done, or even shaking hands if you can avoid it (he cited a man who got fired for shaking a woman's hand ""too long"" in the work place). 

So, I was in the lab the other day, with a bunch of guys. We were all laughing, cutting up, telling jokes, and having a wonderful time doing our jobs. Then, a woman walks into the room. It was like a black curtain had been dropped over everyone. All of us got quiet, and did our jobs without looking up.

The woman never said anything, but I'm sure she felt uncomfortable walking into a room of guys who were clearly having a good time, then everyone shuts up as soon as she walked in. 

So I guess that's what the whole sexual harassment culture has become now in the work place. Men have fun and enjoy work as long as women aren't around. We don't ask them to join us for lunch, we try not to go to them for assistance with projects, and basically try to alienate them as much as possible, because we need our jobs to support our families.

The surprise over it being published in TIME was not a knock at their journalistic integrity, rather that society itself allows women with such absurd beliefs to become relevant to an article like this. TIME **needs** to publish such quotes to help people realize how crazy many outspoken feminists are. Also, I didn't realize that this was 20 years old at the time (seriously), and I appreciate those of you who were more polite in pointing that out (rather than calling me retarded and lacking critical thought).

&gt; **Comins argues that men who are unjustly accused can sometimes gain from the experience.** ""They have a lot of pain, but it is not a pain that I would necessarily have spared them. I think it ideally initiates a process of self-exploration. 'How do I see women?' 'If I didn't violate her, could I have?' 'Do I have the potential to do to her what they say I did?' Those are good questions.""

So it's apparently okay to have someone's reputation trashed, potentially for good, have them spend time in jail, have them face the anxiety of being accused of a crime they didn't commit, etc. just because they might get something out of the experience?

**WHAT. THE. FUCK?**

She's able to say that and get it published in TIME, when if you made the reverse claim -- that rape victims might learn or gain something from the experience -- you'd be labeled a misogynist in a heartbeat, despite them both being world-shattering events that can leave the victim potentially unable to trust anyone ever again.

While I don't think someone who drinks, teases, and dresses provocatively deserves to be raped at all, even under the more vague definitions of rape, you could, however, make the case that they might learn to not send mixed signals and project the image that they're slutty. I don't think that, in the slightest, makes up for the negatives of their experience, but having to ask, ""How do I view women?"" is just as valid as having to ask, ""How do I view myself?""",,False,,t5_2qhk3,True,,,True,t3_fkoqk,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/fkoqk/quotes_like_this_seriously_disturb_me/,

I mean, I might be a multi billionaire, but I can have my kids go to public school, never buy them anything fancy and just not spend that much on them, and it's all ok. As long as they are provided with their basic needs and rights, nobody would ever make me spend half my income on them. As long as I'm not divorced, that is.

Then why the hell does divorced people have to pay half their income on child support?

Shouldn't the government have some sort standard value (somewhat like there is a value for minimum wage), enough for covering a child's BASIC needs and use that value when settling child support cases? 

Why does it have to tied to the person's income? Since the income can change a lot after a divorce, and this has been abused so many times by people just living of of their exes.

This seems so unfair.

I, am a 26 year old man. I've been a victim of Domestic Violence, Sexual assault, and child abuse. 

I've been fortunate, that in the last few years I made a very good friend or two, who solely helped pull me out of relationships that were damaging, and helped me get into healthier ones.

Not everyone is so lucky, that's why Domestic Violence shelters, and community centers for men and women are so vitally important.

I'm sure a lot of you have already read about Earl Silverman, who ran the only shelter for men in ALL of Canada. His constant struggle for funding, and his eventual suicide after funding ran out and the shelter had to close.

 At this point, we can do two things. We can let a good person die in vain, let his work go forgotten except by those who it touched, let the story get swept away in the maelstrom that is our news. Or, we can act.

I know Rachel Maddow might not be a particularly popular person around here, but out of all the newscasters I know of, I believe she's the most likely to pickup on a story like this and most likely to catch it on social media. In my opinion she's always very good at researching a story, and telling all of it. 

So, here's my challenge to you. It only will take you 2-3 minutes. We need to get loud enough that we grab her attention.

rachel@msnbc.com
or
@MaddowBlog

Something short, polite, and simply asking her/her show to look into it. That's all I ask.

Do it for every man, who has taken hit after hit, slap after slap. Do it for every man who has had knives pulled and objects thrown. Do it for me, do it for someone you love, do it for yourself. I don't care. Do it for Earl.

If it wasn't already a damn TV show, I'd say we start a twitter tag ""#MynameisEarl""

My daughter's school start at 9:00 and they will only open the doors at 8:45.  So a lot of kids are dropped of and wait until they open the doors.  (rain, wind ,  or blizzard)  doesn't matter if its not 8:45 or after they won't open the door.

So i took pictures of the kids bunching around and I sent it to the superintendent.  I also spoke to some parents that arrived and surveyed them, I asked what do they think of the doors being locked at 15 minutes to school starting and when they said that they don't like it, I told them they should contact the super and tell her your concerns.

Fast forward 2 weeks, I arrive to drop my daughter to school, and a cop approaches me in front of her.  I ignore him and head to the door waiting for them to open it.    He signals me that he wants to talk to me.

After they let the kids in i talk to him and he said the school district put a complaint of me taking pictures of kids in the morning (Mind you they know exactly what kids and why i sent it to them) they also complained that parents complained that i was harassing them in the morning.

I told the cop that i don't believe it's a police matter, and i'm very surprised that they sent out police for this.  He said well parents get nervous when they see a man take pictures of their kids.

I asked him if taking pictures was illegal, he said no.  I asked him was talking to parents in the morning while waiting was illegal he said no.  But he encouraged me to stop.

Later I called the super and asked her if she's aware that a cop was waiting for me, and she said yes she personally made the call.  She then threatened me that if I don't comply and drop my daughter off quietly and without interruptions I will have to fork out a lot of money for lawyers services.

I felt and still feel Violated.

This is not the first time I've been treated like a second grade parent (even though i have 50/50 with no principal residency with my daughter)

I had to fight for my right to receive letter communication from the school.

I had to make numerous phone calls to be added to the phone alert system.  (at first they refused,  saying that only the primary parent,  the mother (which she is not), will receive these alerts.)


Anyway just venting out,   What do you guys think I should do at this point ?




&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  (how do you put enters on this form ?)


Edit:
Thanks for everyone's support.  Also excuse any grammar or spelling mistakes, i'm in no mind set to comb through.
I think i'll contact a lawyer and see what's his opinion.  Maybe send an official letter to the school board so they could investigate this.

My primary concern now is as follows:
1) I feel like if I contact the school or super about other issues,  they will ignore me and retaliate if they disagree.
2) I don't want this to happen to any other parent. I also have a feeling that if I was a female the situation would be completely different.



Edit2:
Today i had a conversation with a co-worker and i gave her what i wrote and i asked her what does she think.  First thing she said was well you're a men taking pictures of kids, that was wrong.  I'm shocked. Then she went on on how come i can't just drop her off after 8:45, she does it,  ""why do you have to complain ?"".   Totally disregarding the fact that it's not the point.  They should not send a cop to intimidate and harass a concerned parent.    WTF is wrong with this world ?

1370454197.0,413,self.MensRights,1fqfnh,"VA EEO Program Manager sexually assaults male employee, isn't fired, &amp; is then awarded Woman of the Year Award by the VA's Women's EEO Committee",turnall,498,85,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1fqfnh/va_eeo_program_manager_sexually_assaults_male/,"The VA says that it has a no tolerance policy for sexual harassment, but in practice, that doesn't seem to be the policy at all. Violations of sexual harassment policies seem to be tacitly condoned by staff at all levels, from facility management, all the way up to Secretary General of the VA, Eric Shinseki. 

In November of 2009, at the Central California VAMC in Fresno, CA, a male employee was sexually assaulted by the intoxicated EEO Program Manager, the very person who is supposed to prevent sexual harassment. A Judge found against the facility, and stated that the Facility Director, Mr. X’s “primary concern was for Ms. Y, the perpetrator of the harassment, not for Mr. T, the victim of harassment.” Ms. Y received no discipline and even though Mr. T won the case, he actually lost money in pursuing justice through the court process. Within the year, in the height of irony, Ms. Y was named the ""Woman of the Year"" by a VA's Women's EEO Committee. She still remains in charge of the EEO program (equivalent perhaps, to putting a convicted rapist in charge of victim advocacy and prosecuting sex crimes?). How many of us think things would have been handled differently if the EEO Program Manager had been male and the victim a female?

The Agency then began to retaliate against Mr. T, creating a hostile and intolerable work environment, leading to him having to transfer to a job in a different state and denying him advancement opportunities. Clearly, the financial and emotional cost to the employee, along with the culture of silence and reprisal for reporting anything to management, actively discourages people from filing complaints. Secretary Shinseki has stated “the Department will vigorously enforce all applicable Federal EEO laws, regulations, executive orders, and management directives to ensure equal opportunity in the workplace for all VA employees.” Mr. T's experience suggests that these words are meaningless and empty. 

His experience is reminiscent of controversies from two decades ago. In 1992, Congressional hearings about sexual harassment within the VA led to the VA stating it would adopt an absolute zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment. In 1997 Congressional hearings, a VA employee who was a victim of sexual harassment posed the question “how do you prevent further victimization from an agency who seeks to quiet the victims, and reward the perpetrators.” This question continues to remain unanswered. How many decades will it take for the VA to openly address this problem and make genuine changes?

Documentation of this:

http://www.va.gov/ORM/docs/Analysis_of_Findings_of_Discrimination_FY_2012.pdf

you can read more about this case, page 28, case number 28.

It's actually scary to read through these cases and see how often there seem to be no consequences for management at these VAs where people are harassed!

Here's a summary: 

""While at a work-related conference, two events occurred which the complainant found blatantly and sexually offensive. The first included an incident where a facility EEO Program Manager got extremely intoxicated to the point that she made sexually explicit gestures and comments toward the complainant. The EEO Program Manager grabbed the complainant’s buttocks, lunged at him, and indicated that she wanted to “dry hump” him. The second incident occurred the next morning during breakfast when the complainant’s supervisor called him over to his table. His supervisor asked him to turn around, and commented that the complainant’s butt was alright and then laughed."" 

""Despite witnesses to both events, very little action was taken toward the EEO Program Manager involved in the first incident, and absolutely no disciplinary action was taken against the complainant’s supervisor involved in the second incident.""

The man who was harassed felt so uncomfortable about it that he ended up transferring to a lower-paying department and eventually had to transfer to a VA in another state, after being retaliated against for reporting this.

1339457136.0,404,self.MensRights,uwyuc,Gay shaming has to stop,,584,180,182,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/uwyuc/gay_shaming_has_to_stop/,"Slut shaming has been a wildfire topic since the popular Youtube video of a young, bright teenage girl vlogged about her high school experiences (would link the vid but work site blocks YT). The femmenazis and white knights have heralded the subject as a ultimate example of how society continues to marginalize the sexuality of women. They claim there is no slut analogue for men, hence creating a double standard. Men are ""allowed to have as much sex as they want"", and ""their sexuality is a status icon"", and ""they desire it beyond all wealth and possessions"", and ""will stop at nothing to get it."" And we're supposed to be okay with that...

Aside from male genitalia being a conventional slang for anything insulting, crude, uncivilized, or insensitive, there is an analogous ""slut"" standard for men, the insult of being ""gay"". We all know that homosexuality is marginalizing on both fronts, but we've truly fail to acknoweldge that men get it *way worse* than women do. Gay men have suffered tremendously in lynch mobs, systematic extermination, castration, and worse throughout history and these trends continue. Lesbian activity, conversely, has been a sort of hush-hush societal topic like ""Boston Marriages"". For fuck's sake, I had a professor during my undergrad who asided to me after class--in a long, meandering explanation-- that he's generally against homosexuality because of religion and because he thinks gay sex is disgusting, though he does feel torn because lesbians ""are a beautiful thing"". 

The other day, my younger cousin and I were at a restaurant, passing comments about a good looking female waitress. He urged me to make a move and I said that I didn't feel interested. The knee jerk reflex, ""What are you, gay, man?"". I struggled to grasp why that should be an appropriate comment. I realized it was an intimidation tactic; that, because I wasn't conforming to the male role, I could be badgered into it for fear of being labeled as the least masculine male trait.

I asked him, ""And what if I was?"" (knowing full well that I'm not). I would much rather have freedom to act out of my own volition than to maintain a societal perception that I'm manly. Homophobia has really, really trumped the behaviors of this generation of males, speaking as a mid 20s man, and probably to some extent in the older generations as well, though I have not met anyone willing to talk about that experience. Showing any kind of hurt through crying, shaking, or laughing is considered a complete shame in men, getting ridicule and making people generally feel uncomfortable. It's automatically associated with being gay because it has conventionally become the most emasculating insult we can conjure to bully men into ""sucking it up"", hence attaching more stigma to the concept of being ""gay"" as a sexual orientation. The result of bullying through gay insults? Men act placid, calm, unphased... though in any other light, those same attributes to the extreme are seen as ""insensitive"" and ""crude"". These are the same men who suffer in relationships because they cannot get their desired closeness, cannot asked to be touched, or loved. Neither man nor woman feels satisfied in a relationship that's defined by behavioral barriers, yet they're so reinforced by our actions. I believe to the greatest extent, men suffer because their needs fall dead last on the needs of the whole.

It's time to end the intimidation tactics and the slandering of a lifestyle deemed ""immasculine"". I doubt this is news to most of you here, and for me my revelation and realized feelings are coming somewhat late in life, but it seems like an MRA topic that deserves more attention.

1326385571.0,405,self.MensRights,oe1iw,"Falsely Accused and Suspended from College without Evidence, Based Solely on the Accuser's word",TheFalselyAccused,541,136,199,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/oe1iw/falsely_accused_and_suspended_from_college/,"Hi Reddit. Please get ready because this is going to be long, and I sincerely need your help. I'm writing because I've run out of options and have no idea what to do. I'd like to start by explaining the incident, and then detail how what this college (in New York) has done to make my life a living Hell. First, there are no criminal charges against me, at all. Even though the woman tried to file a restraining order, she was denied and there was nothing for the city police to pursue because **Spoiler alert**: I never assaulted anyone.

I was a college grad student, and this started in August, during classes. I met a woman in class, we hit it off, exchanged numbers after class, and agreed to study together later in the week. We did study, we got food, and then we went to a public are off campus to chill (this is where the incident happened). We talked for a while, then we kissed, things were going well, she complimented me, and I reciprocated. Then we walked back to campus and I dropped her off at her dorm and went back to my place off-campus. 

**Three hours later the police come to my door asking if I forced myself on this woman, who told them she told me about her boyfriend and that I forced myself on her at this public place.**

Needless to say, I was stunned, shocked and panicking. My father rightfully told me to write everything as I remembered in as much detail as possible. I did, and shortly after got a local attorney. As I stated before, the city did not press charges despite her trying to get an Order of Protection against me and being denied. However, the next day I received (via a college cop that forced himself into my apartment and me having to tell him to get out) a letter of charges from the college. They said under her complaint I was being charged with sexual assault, sexual harassment, and physical assault. They immediately issued their own temporary psuedo-restraining order against me (despite proving nothing, and of course not putting the same mandate on her). They also told me if I plead guilty I would get a two-year suspension with a therapy mandate, and a permanent psuedo-restraining order for the woman (all of which they ultimately imposed on me anyway). I also received her written complaint, in it she makes numerous accusations about me stalking her, sending her texts to come to me late at night, and offering her drugs (via text). I printed out the actual log of texts to disprove all of it; but don't worry, she weasels out of it and they let her.

I met with my attorney and told him my story. He was allowed to sit at the hearing, but forbidden from speaking at all, I had to present my own case entirely. He said to me that it was good, and there was no way they could convict me since there was no evidence, and it's essentially word against word. Yeah..

I went to the hearing and had my attorney present, but he was not allowed to speak. There was **one** judge, a health department professor I've never seen before. They told me to ""tell them what happened"". Right away I knew this was going to be bad, because they made me go first, giving ""the victim"" a chance for rebuttal after me. I told the truth, and said that I didn’t do what she alleged, I had consent, she explicitly said that conveyed that during our time. Whenever I said something that contradicted or disproved one of her claims, she was allowed to have outbursts by yelling “WHAT?” or by hitting the table. I however, was constantly told to mind my demeanor beforehand.

Then she got her chance, and basically got to say whatever she wanted about me, and they ate it up. She basically said that I coerced her into giving me her number (uh-huh), then I told her about my family history and how my parents kicked me out (what?), and that I was offering her drugs (this accusation makes me furious). She then proceeded to detail how I repeatedly gouged my tongue down her throat when we were together (not making this up) and that I threatened her that I would use “my mixed martial arts” when she “resisted” (no, really, that’s the entirety of the threat according to her) (She knew I did MMA because I told her I practiced MMA when we studied ). Finally, the coup de grace for outrage, she said something like this: “He told me not to come forward with charges because he said he knew people in the Student conduct office. **Well guess what (My name)? I’m here, and I’m coming forward**”
… 

She made allegations that I stalked her via text. What happened when I printed them and proved that everything she said was wrong? She simply said “Oh, he did all of that verbally”. So, things like “he invited me to his apartment at 11PM and offered me “drugs””, which **she wrote was true in a sworn statement to University Police** became “I made a mistake and he did all that verbally”. Yeah. Right.

She had “witnesses”. As defined by this school, a witness can be someone who didn’t see anything, but **heard what the “victim” had to say after**. That’s okay with them.  So, I was notified of her having two (Resident Assistant, Resident Hall Director), and a surprise third I wasn’t aware of (her friend of ten years, because that’s really objective). They all basically testified this “She came to us (individually and at different times) and was very scared”. Again, these witnesses were all after we parted, so they only heard her word. But it gets better. I got written statements from the two I knew of ahead of time, and pointed out clear contradictions in what they wrote against what she wrote. Basically, they had me in different places than her sworn statement, and doing different things. For instance, the Resident Hall Director, one we can assume knows her job and can document well, wrote: “She said “X” had followed her to the dorm **and last she saw him he was sitting on a bench outside waiting for her**. The “victim”, however, wrote that “he looked as though he was going to sit at a bench outside my dorm and wait for me, **but then took off to another part of campus** (like I’m the goddamn Batman or something, I was just going home).  I made sure to, minding my demeanor, of course, point these and other contradictions out. Oh, but it gets better.

So, the witnesses got to testify. The Resident Hall Director was straightforward, testified what she knew and left, nothing wrong really. The Resident Assistant on the other hand, was a total bafoon. He wrote next to nothing in his statement, and when I asked why, he basically forgot everything… despite writing his statement the day after she supposedly went to him…

The last witness was interesting. I say this because I only had her verbal testimony. Nowhere did the “victim” write that I had groped her in a sexual way. Yet this “best friend” she told via text, said I groped her numerous times. Oh I pointed out the problem with that, and Oh, they still didn’t care. When the “victim” got to ask her bff questions, it was something to the extent of “Omigosh have I ever freaked out about something like this before?!” “Nope!”, because apparently to her, and to this school, that is a viable argument for proof.

Speaking of questions, not only was I not allowed to address her directly (even though she got to do that to me, instead I had to ask through the presiding arbiter), but they stopped me when they knew my perfectly reasonable, relevant, and “well-demeanored”  question was going to hurt her case. How did they know, you ask? Simple, I phrased the question to the officer, and was met with a “You can’t ask that”. Yup. Further, I had to phrase the question first, so they could “amend” it, if need be. As you can imagine, they did. So much so that any point I was trying to make via questioning was mangled to the point of losing all value.

Knowing she was allowed to bring BS witnesses, I decided to bring someone to speak for me who didn’t see what happened, but knew me deeply. My school counselor. In our years together I divulged everything to her. When I told her of the charges, she made me the offer to speak for me first. I figured she’d be kind of relevant on these things because she has a Masters in Social Work, someone who you’d think is kinda more qualified to speak on these things than the bureaucrats, right? She testified about me, told them decisively “This is a man who understands boundaries, and even when presented with challenges, **always respects women**”. An instance she gave was when I confided in her about my frustration when I was dating a Protestant girl I cared about. She didn’t believe in pre-marital sex, and even though it was a challenge, in her words I “always, always respected that”. But yeah, they didn’t care about that either.

How, you say? Well, I got the verdict, and the reasoning behind it, let me read it as it’s written for you: “I (the one professor who decided everything, including punishment) have decided that you are in violation of Sexual Assault, Sexual Harassment, and Physical Assault. This is because **of the credible testimony of the victim and the witness**” (which witness? Your guess is as good as mine). The hearing lasted three hours, I was the only person who provided actual proof, I showed the contradictions, and made a case that sounded perfectly reasonable: **She cheated on her boyfriend and now she’s trying to cover for it by filing sexual assault charges**.

Overnight there were some valid criticisms which I would like the chance to address. Instead of addressing them all separately I have decided to (as soon as I can) write a single response that will outline my intent behind this, address any criticism and put forward a case for my position. 

I will however address the accusation that I am a LNP plant. I am not affiliated with any political party and my interest in this is wholly concerned with the strategic value for an MRM advocacy plan that I am putting together.

Reciprocity was associated with more frequent violence among women (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.9, 2.8), but not men (AOR=1.26; 95% CI=0.9, 1.7). Regarding injury, men were more likely to inflict injury than were women (AOR=1.3; 95% CI=1.1, 1.5), and reciprocal intimate partner violence was associated with greater injury than was nonreciprocal intimate partner violence regardless of the gender of the perpetrator (AOR=4.4; 95% CI=3.6, 5.5).

**DOMINANCE AND SYMMETRY IN PARTNER VIOLENCE BY MALE AND FEMALE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN 32 NATIONS**


The empirical data on these issues were provided by 13,601 university students who participated in the International Dating Violence Study in 32 nations. The results in the first part of this paper show that almost a third of the female as well as male students physically assaulted a dating partner in the 12 month study period, and that the most frequent pattern was mutuality in violence, i.e. both were violent, followed by “female-only” violence. Violence by only the male partner was the least frequent pattern according to both male and female participants.

**Who Perpetrates Teen Dating Violence?**


The authors reviewed the findings from three studies that examined who (boys, girls or both) commits violence in teen dating relationships. In the Toledo adolescent relationship study, which interviewed more than 1,300 seventh, ninth and 11th graders, 13 percent of girls in physically aggressive relationships reported that boys were the sole perpetrators, 36 percent said they were the sole perpetrators, and 51 percent reported both they and their partner committed aggressive acts during the relationship. Six percent of the boys in physically aggressive relationships said they were the sole perpetrators, 47 percent said girls were the sole perpetrators, and 47 percent reported mutual aggression. In the Suffolk County study of dating aggression in Long Island, N.Y., high schools, 5 percent of girls in physically aggressive relationships reported that boys were the sole perpetrators, 28 percent said they were the sole perpetrators, and 65 percent reported both they and their partner committed aggressive acts during the relationship. Five percent of the boys in physically aggressive relationships said they were the sole perpetrators, 27 percent said girls were the sole perpetrators, and 66 percent reported mutual aggression.* In the Oregon youth couples study, which videotaped teen couples while they performed problem-solving tasks, researchers observed that in 8 percent of the physically aggressive relationships, boys were the sole perpetrators; in 33 percent of the physically aggressive relationships, girls were the sole perpetrators; and in 58 percent there was mutual aggression.

&gt;My original feminism was about equality: women were equal to men and all we needed was the laws to force misogynists to stop being misogynists. The older I get, the more I believe that ‘equality’ is nothing more than a smokescreen to prevent the true liberation of women. Equality before the law means nothing when violence is endemic;

http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/louise-pennington/radical-feminism_b_3169754.html

This is as close to the truth as it can get, imo.

Also, interesting commentary by Antifeminist Tech:

&gt;This is what it comes down to.  Actual equality does not benefit women, and talking about equality is getting them nowhere, so a wide range of misandrist voices are now openly against it.  However, actual equality benefits men.  Equality before the law means that women can’t go around making false rape or false abuse charges and expect to get away with it.  Equality of opportunity means that women actually have to produce and not be a leech off men.  A job market with equality of opportunity would end up looking a lot like the tech industry does now with predominately male employment with a disproportionately high number of unmarried men because men are on average better qualified for most jobs.  Women would be left out in the cold because they couldn’t compete for jobs, and they couldn’t get married unless they worked to show that they could add to a man’s life.

What seems to be happening instead is that a bunch of persistently-bent-out-of-shape feminists on reddit circlejerk incessantly about the supposed ""misogyny circlejerk"" and how oppressed their views are, irrelevant of the fact that their ""oppressed"" opinions are upvoted to the top of every comment thread and the supposedly misogynistic comments that are rampant on reddit are -100 karma at the bottom of the page, if they exist at all. It doesn't seem to me that there is any misogyny circlejerk on reddit. Rather, it seems that there's an anti-misogyny circlejerk that just loves to circlejerk about a fictional misogyny circlejerk. And god forbid you point out that a supposed example of misogyny *isn't actually an example of misogyny*, because you'll quickly find yourself jumped on by a gang of white knights who will downvote you into obscurity while upvoting the College Liberal Feminist who made the initial baseless claim of ""sickening misogyny"" in the first place.

Meanwhile, counter-examples of misandry just get laughed off or dismissed, and pointing out that they're misandric gets you the same response as pointing out false accusations of misogyny.

It seems like increasingly any pro-male or non-feminist opinions on reddit are being supressed and labeled as ""misogyny"", all while the pro-feminist groups are ironically bemoaning how oppressed their views are by the ""Patriarchy"".",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_1ik8ja,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/1ik8ja/something_ive_noticed_about_the_misogyny_on_reddit/,

And she's not a feminist, and has often gladly given dissenting opinions during discussions with family members who are feminists.  

Here's the interesting point she brings up.  She works in a primarily male dominated profession, law enforcement.  She's an investigator for the state police in the state we live in, and she's damn good at her job too.  One time while discussing the idea of feminism, she told me this.  

&gt;I work in a very male dominated job, and so do a few of my female co-workers.  I've discussed this idea with them, and none of them are advocates of women's rights like you read on the internet, or hear about radical feminists.  The problem with the women's rights movement is this, most of those radical feminists, are in jobs where they don't really have to deal with real life.  They're in professions like college professors, secretaries, stupid shit like that. 

&gt;A lot of people say that business is a man's world, but where I work, it's truly a man's world.  I could count the amount of women who work where I work on one hand.  A lot of these feminists don't live or work in a man's world.  If they were to, they would see that the men don't treat them any differently than they treat each other.  There's no special rules for harassment, because we all harass each other, we all play jokes on each other, we all call each other names, it happens.  The feminists live in a world where they create this pseudo-oppression for themselves, and blame it on men.  Subsequently they feel the need to try and take rights away from men.  Equality for women is already here.  Feminists don't want equality, they want power.  

&gt;I'd also like to see one of those ""Strong Womyn"" go and do my job.  I'd like to see how they handle putting a bullet-proof vest on.  No, really I would.

James Taranto, WSJ",PostPatriarchalMan,484,108,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/wazhx/feminism_is_for_equality_between_the_sexesexcept/,"&gt;**Equality or Female Supremacy?** 

&gt;David Brooks has a thoughtful column on the problems of boys in our contemporary gynocentric educational system. It's a bit remarkable that this passage made it into the New York Times:

&gt;&gt;Some of the decline in male performance may be genetic. The information age rewards people who mature early, who are verbally and socially sophisticated, who can control their impulses. Girls may, on average, do better at these things. After all, boys are falling behind not just in the U.S., but in all 35 member-nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

&gt;Wasn't Larry Summers run out of town a few years back for similar speculations about genetic differences between the sexes? Yes he was, as the Times reported then:

&gt;&gt;He suggested at an economics conference that the low representation of women scientists at universities might stem from, among other causes, innate differences between the sexes.
Mr. Summers's provocative yodel set off a worldwide avalanche of commentary and condemnation. One of the most prominent female scientists at M.I.T. walked out in the middle of the talk; a Harvard faculty committee on women wrote the president a letter saying he had done grave damage to the university's reputation.
Mr. Summers was forced to don the hairshirt.

&gt;Of course the difference is obvious. It's fine to assert that there are ways in which women are superior to men, as Brooks did. It's intolerable even to entertain the possibility that there are ways in which men are superior to women, as Summers did. Feminism is for equality between the sexes--except when inequality is to the disadvantage of men.

&gt;One of the most important verbal tactics used by abusers is this: minimizing, denying, and blaming. Abusers minimize the pain they cause; they deny that they caused it; they blame the victim for what happened.

&gt;Thorn, Clarisse (2012-03-06). Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser: Long Interviews with Hideous Men (Kindle Locations 2923-2924).  . Kindle Edition. 

What are some common feminist responses to men's rights issues?  

* Your problems as men are minor compared to what women face (minimization).

* Feminism did not contribute to your problems (denying).

* We live in a patriarchy, so you men caused your own problems (blaming).

Using a feminist definition of abuse, it would appear that common feminist attacks on men's rights issues are abusive in nature.",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_qwb78,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/qwb78/a_feminist_definition_of_abuse_backfires/,

“To call a man an animal is to flatter him; he’s a machine, a walking dildo.” -– Valerie Solanas

“I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig.” — Andrea Dworkin

“Rape is nothing more or less than a conscious process of intimidation by which all men keep all women in a state of fear” — Susan Brownmiller

“The more famous and powerful I get the more power I have to hurt men.” — Sharon Stone

“The proportion of men must be reduced to and maintained at approximately 10% of the human race.” — Sally Miller Gearhart

“[Men falsely accused of rape] have a lot of pain , but it is not a pain that I would necessarily have spared them.” – Catherine Comins*

“All men are rapists and that’s all they are” — Marilyn French

“Probably the only place where a man can feel really secure is in a maximum security prison, except for the imminent threat of release.” — Germaine Greer.

 “A commitment to sexual equality with men is a commitment to becoming the rich instead of the poor, the rapist instead of the raped, the murderer instead of the murdered.”

The quotes were shamelessly lifted from [this compilation](
http://www.womenagainstmen.com/media/feminism-is-a-hate-group.html)


edit: Been getting a lot of complaints that the quotes aren't that ""current"" (nevermind that many of those quoted helped build the feminism we know today)

So here's one that's pretty damn current, from one of the largest feminist activist groups around:

Thanks to /u/AloysiusC for the reminder of that particular bit of violent feminist hatred.

I also removed the MacKinnon quote because it was misattributed.

Also, as has been pointed out a bunch of times, I accidentally duplicated an Andrea Dworkin quote. So I've replaced it with another one.

Backstory to justify the gratitude: I watched my dad work 14 hour days my whole life to provide an amazing life for my family. He was cheated on, emotionally abused, and generally treated like a tool in the lives of the women around him. He was served with divorce papers after 27 years of faithful marriage (on his part- despite the last 15 years being in spent in seperate bedrooms). The point of this is that since then he has discovered his own group of Men's Rights activists, and has become the same great man he always has been- just with massive stones. 

I am a military girlfriend, and I have watched dozens...*dozens and dozens* of good providers, strong, amazing men, be cheated on, villianized, emotionally abused, and finally be divorced and have their children virtually taken away from them (while paying child support and living in a studio apartment). All because they're *men.*

I attribute this entirely to skewed ""feminism"" and the idea that women get everything they want and have to do none of the work. Period. Because they're women and once, they couldn't vote. No matter what the situation, a woman is the ""victim"" of a man. It sickens me. :(

I conclude that it concludes that females rape a lot. A whole lot. 
This document reeks of sexism against males. However, there is some interesting evidence to be found. I am only reporting on one set of data -RAPE. My comments are found as such: [ My comments. ]
 
http://www.cdc.gov/ViolencePrevention/pd...2010-a.pdf
CDC NATIONAL INTIMATE PARTNER SEXUAL AND VIOLENCE SURVEY 2010 Report
 
P. 17
How NISVS Measured Sexual Violence
Five types of sexual violence were measured in NISVS. These include acts of rape (forced penetration), and types of sexual violence other than rape.
 

• Rape is defined as any completed or attempted unwanted vaginal (for women), oral, or anal penetration through the use of physical force (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threats to physically harm and includes times when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent. Rape is separated into three types, completed forced penetration, attempted forced penetration, and completed alcohol or drug facilitated penetration.
 
-Among women, rape includes vaginal, oral, or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes vaginal or anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.
-Among men, rape includes oral or anal penetration by a male using his penis. It also includes anal penetration by a male or female using their fingers or an object.
 

• Being made to penetrate someone else includes times when the victim was made to, or there was an attempt to make them, sexually penetrate someone without the victim’s consent because the victim was physically forced (such as being pinned or held down, or by the use of violence) or threatened with physical harm, or when the victim was drunk, high, drugged, or passed out and unable to consent.
 
-Among women, this behavior reflects a female being made to orally penetrate another female’s vagina or anus.
 -Among men, being made to penetrate someone else could have occurred in multiple ways: being made to vaginally penetrate a female using one’s own penis; orally penetrating a female’s vagina or anus; anally penetrating a male or female; or being made to receive oral sex from a male or female. It also includes female perpetrators attempting to force male victims to penetrate them, though it did not happen.
 
[So, if a male penetrates a female or another male with his penis, it is defined as rape. If a female forces a male to penetrate her with his penis it is defined as forced penetration -ie: NOT RAPE. The definition of rape used in this document is therefore SEXIST. This is how they avoid statistically categorizing females as perpetrators of rape and males as victims, in spite of the fact that females admit to committing rape against males. See the post in the stats warehouse http://forums.avoiceformen.com/showthread.php?tid=1028 for one example. -7.6% of women surveyed admitted to taking advantage of a man's incapacitated state or using force to have sex with a man against his will.] 



P.18
Nearly 1 in 5 women in the United States has been raped in her lifetime (18.3%) (Table 2.1). This translates to almost 22 million women in the United States. 


Approximately 1 in 71 men in the United States (1.4%) reported having been raped in his lifetime, which translates to almost 1.6 million men in the United States (Table 2.2). 


One percent, or approximately 1.3 million women, reported some type of rape victim­ization in the 12 months prior to taking the survey. 


Too few men reported rape in the 12 months prior to taking the survey to produce a reliable 12 month preva­lence estimate.
 

[ Since the rape of males, by the definition used in this document, can only by perpetrated by other males, too few males raped other males in the 12 months previous to the study to be considered a statistic -this does not include prison rape. This information lends to the conclusion that male on male rape -outside of prison environments- is more rare than male on female rape. We also see how rape -by their definition- is statistically accounted for as a crime which only males perpetrate in the USA -not to mention other countries which follow this sexist definition.]
 




P.19
Approximately 1 in 20 women (5.6%) and men (5.3%) experienced sexual violence victimization other than rape in the 12 months prior to taking the survey. 


Sexual coercion was reported by 2.0% of women in the 12 months prior to taking the survey... [and] 1.5% [of men] in the 12 months prior to taking the survey (Table 2.2). 


[ Statistics prior to the 12 month period are unreliable as males as victims and females as offenders were not included in most studies/reports regarding rape, forced penetration or sexal assault. Since the definition of rape employed here is sexist in origin, the term must be re-defined to include female offenders and male victims. Therefore, we have previous data that are one-sided and discriminatory, and definitions that still are in order to render the conclusions from the current data-sets discriminatory. ] 





P.24 Lifetime Statistics
 Most perpetrators of all forms of sexual violence against women were male. For female rape victims, 98.1% reported only male perpetrators. Additionally, 92.5% of female victims of sexual violence other than rape reported only male perpetrators. For male victims, the sex of the perpetrator varied by the type of sexual violence expe­rienced. The majority of male rape victims (93.3%) reported only male perpetrators. For three of the other forms of sexual violence, a majority of male victims reported only female perpetrators: being made to penetrate (79.2%), sexual coercion (83.6%), and unwanted sexual contact (53.1%). 

[ The 6.7% of rape victims that did not report males as the perpetrator would therefore fall into the “anal penetration by a female using a finger or object“ category, as found on page 17. ]
 




And now, some truth.
 
P.18 (Table 2.10) Previous 12 months
 1.1% of females, or 1 270 000, were victims of rape.
 
P.24 Lifetime Statistics
 For female rape victims, 98.1% reported only male perpetrators. 

P.19 (Table 2.2) Previous 12 months
 1.1% of males, or 1 267 000, were forced to penetrate.
 
P.24 Lifetime Statistics
 79.2% of males forced to penetrate reported female perpetrators. 


[ If we accept the average lifetime percentages used on page 24 as a guide for the statistics reported for the 12 month period previous to this study -we must, since the similar statistics for the preceding 12 month period are not given- we find the following: 1 003 464 males reported to being forced by a female to penetrate a female and 1 245 870 females reported being raped by a male in the 12 months prior to this study. ]
 
[ Furthermore, the 6.7% of 'lifetime' male rape victims (by their definition) that did not report males as the perpetrator and would therefore fall into the “anal penetration by a female using a finger or object“ category, as found on page 17 are not accounted for in the 12 months previous to this study. This would therefore add to the number of female perpetrators and male victims over the 12-month period previous to this study. Please keep this in mind as you read on.] 






I have decided to render the definition of rape sex-neutral and include female perpetrators in my brief analysis.
 
“We find through the above statistics that 1 003 464 males and 1 245 870 females were the victims of rape or attempted rape by the opposite sex over the 12-month period previous to this study. We can conclude that over 44% of the perpetrators of rape or attempted rape during the 12 month period previous to this study were FEMALE”",,False,,t5_2qhk3,False,,,True,t3_143skb,http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/143skb/2010_cdc_survey_on_sexual_violence_shows_that/,

Look, I don't know what Men's Rights means to other people here. But to me, it means *men's rights*. It means fighting for the things that men have worse off than women and it means raising awareness of casual misandry and sexism.

It doesn't mean ""fighting feminism"". This isn't a movement that is defined as opposition to another movement. There are self-proclaimed feminists who are our allies, and, yes, there are self-proclaimed feminists who are our enemies, but right now we're elevating the latter to such a position of importance that we apparently cannot describe the Men's Rights movement without them.

Right now, that malicious and unnecessarily angry message is the first thing anyone sees when they look at the subreddit. I don't think it's necessary and I don't think it's helping us.

Let's make the Men's Rights Movement something of its own, not something that can exist only in the shadow of feminism.

She regretted having sex with someone after barley knowing him, and loosing her virginity to a guy who didn't love her in a bathroom at the mall. To make herself feel better, she claims rape, yet romantically pursues my boyfriend for four years after they break up. My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. She has constantly been putting me down. I'm no good, I'm pathetic, a slut, and stupid for thinking my boyfriend would love me. 

I am a victim of rape. I was brutally raped by my first boyfriend and his best friend at the same time. I hate this girl for not only trying to ruin my life, but also for discrediting my experience by making herself out to be a victim and for accusing my current boyfriend of being a rapist. I finally learn how to trust again, and she throws the past in my face. I posted on r/confession and what do you know, they are supporting her and trying to convince me that it was my boyfriends fault. I'm livid. They don't know any of us or the situation, yet it is the mans fault. They don't even try to understand the situation better before blaming him. Typical. Woman need to take responsibility for their actions. Rape is NOT a choice that you regret. Rape is not when you feel uncomfortable in a situation, or when you feel pressured and are too afraid to say no (threats are not pressure by the way, I understand that.) My boyfriend is so traumatized by this situation, that the first year we made love he was constantly asking ""are you okay? Is this alright with you?"" and he would just want to stop and hold me if he thought I was uncomfortable, even if I wasn't. Totally sounds like the behavior of a rapist, right? 

Please tell me I'm not alone on this. I'm sorry you men have to deal with the constant fear of being accused of being something so awful. As a victim of rape, I want to say that I know that not every guy should be treated as a sexual deviant.
