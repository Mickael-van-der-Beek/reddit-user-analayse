I've been thinking this for a long time. The first time the Scranton Strangler is mentioned is the night Pam has her first baby, and Toby isn't in this episode at all. He also loves Pam so he would be upset at her having another man's child. Reason two, when they are all watching the Scranton Strangler car chase, Toby is not present at all, but everyone else is. Three, when Toby is put on the jury for the Scranton Strangler he is ecstatic, and then says he knows he convicted an innocent man.

1368725610.0,96,self.theoffice,1egng3,How The Office Changed My Life,youngandstarving,112,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/theoffice/comments/1egng3/how_the_office_changed_my_life/,"Tonight is the last episode of The Office. The last time I will ever see an episode for the first time. I already know I’m going to cry my eyes out at the ending because this show means so much to me. 

When I was in high school, I felt like I had nothing to live for. I had no friends, I hated myself, and I thought my life was going nowhere. I was just very sad most of the time and I didn’t think anyone could understand. I wanted to give up. 

I would go to the library every week and find my happiness in books. I read all the time because books were the only thing that understood. Then, one day I decided to look at the DVDs. I was passing by and came across The Office. “Hm,” I thought, “I remember someone saying this was a good show.” So I got the first season. 

I went home and watched it and automatically fell in love with the awkward humor and ridiculous antics of the show. I don’t think I laughed that much at anything in a long time before I found The Office. Every week I would go back to get the next disc, disappointed if the one I was waiting for wasn’t there. Every week I  had something to look forward to. Something to make me laugh until I cried, something to be like a friend to me when I only had myself. 

I watched all the reruns on television and season 5 which was currently airing, following along with all the characters’ story lines, laughing and crying with them because I felt like I knew them. I screamed in joy when Pam found out she was pregnant, cried my eyes out when Michael left, and I still smile at all the little moments between characters that show how much they’ve grown since season one. I’ve been with these characters for years now; I love them and I care about them and it makes me so sad that after tonight we never get to know what happens to them. 

I never knew when I picked up that first disc that this show would become such a huge part of my life. That it would be the only thing by my side until the end of high school. That years later when I need something to cheer me up, I still turn to The Office. Now, 5 years later, I own all the seasons on DVD, several t-shirts, two mugs, a Dundie, even Angela’s creepy baby poster, and I visited Scranton. Most people who know me think I’m a crazed fan. But really, I love The Office for playing a part in saving my life. 

I used to think nothing would ever make me happy, but then The Office came along. It slowly cheered me up on my worst days, became the one thing I could always turn to for a laugh. It was there for me through all the sadness I experienced, through all the times I thought I’d never make it. Whenever I get sad, I can still turn on The Office and be prepared to laugh until I feel better again. It never lets me down. 

Tonight is going to be rough for me. You can watch the episodes over and over a million times (and I do), but there is nothing quite like seeing an episode for the very first time, experiencing the laughter and emotions of something brand new. I am going to miss The Office more than any other show on television, simply because I will always remember it as something that saved me.

It became very evident when Jim mentioned that you grow to love the ones you are around. Then they pan to the boom mic guy. WTF!

Then he saves Pam from a beat down. Then meets with her and they have a 'moment'.... this sucks...

I am a bit attached to them as a couple and while I think its good to show the drama they were going through I hardly think it should lead to what is happening.

I hope Jim leaves Athlead... I am predicting a really rough patch but in the end Jim and Pam will live happily ever after.

The Feb 21st episode is called MOVING ON...so WTF is that about. We will see.

See, with the exception of Michael, Dwight has always been resentful of anybody in the regional manager position (Angelo, Andy, Nelly) for reasons that aren't hard to figure out so I'm wondering, was there a point in time after Michael became regional manager where Dwight hated Michael?  The first few seasons would have me believe that Dwight has always been a suck up, just based on the nature of his relationship with Michael vs. his relationship with Jim.  What did Dwight think of Michael when they were fellow salesmen?  Did he have any respect for him or were they rivals in the same way he was with Jim?  Was Michael the #1 salesman or Dwight?  And how long after Michael became regional manager did they start shooting the doc?",,False,self,t5_2qo7e,False,,,True,t3_1kanzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/theoffice/comments/1kanzi/the_office_prehistory/,

Pam teases Jim about his guy, and Jim tries to go back to the subject at hand, Dwight, but Pam says she wants to see more of ""Philly Jim"". This took me a while to realize, but after re watching the episodes a bunch of times it finally clicked. Fast forward to season 9, and Pam no longer likes the real ""Philly Jim"".

Also, **I love this show** and have been a huge fan since season 2.  The past few episodes have been really funny, but the show has been going for 8 seasons.  That is a long time for any show.

1.  **The show messes with romantic relationships for the sake of it**, and it is getting really tired for me.  The newest drama is if Jim is going to cheat on Pam.  For me, the story of their relationship ended a few episodes after their wedding.  I don't want to think of them as anything other than happy, young, beautiful, and in love.  I am annoyed with this storyline because there is no underlying reason for Jim to cheat.  It seems like a shallow plot device.  It would be nice if they really got into the difficulties marriage can present after a number of years, or the difficulties of raising children, but it seems like the only way the The Office writers can keep things interesting is by messing with who's having sex with who.

2.  **The show used to play with important themes and questions**, and I don't see them anymore or at all.  One of my favorite aspects of the show was the tension between big-business ethics vs. small business ethics, or how a desk job can suck the life out of its employees.  I loved the show in the beginning because all the characters had dreams and hopes bigger than The Office (Pam's dream of being an artist, Michael's sense of family, Jim's career aspirations, etc.).  I always thought of The Office as a place from which one escapes, not the other way around (i.e. The Office is the opposite of the bar in Cheers).  The Office even played with the tensions of a depressed economy (when Michael started his own paper company).  They simply don't raise these kinds of existential questions and themes that people can relate too anymore (I feel).

3.  **It bothers me that Andy is a totally different character** from 3-4 seasons ago.  I feel like his personality changed simply to make him more likable.  But there was no source for the personality change.  He just kind of faded into the background after he broke up with Angela, and then instead of an angry and insecure goofball he became a silly and thoughtful goofball, because that's what the writers needed in the seventh season.  That's one side of the argument, however, and I could understand the argument that he does in fact have depth if you look hard enough.

Anyone else think about this stuff?  I have been watching this show way too much lately I think.",,False,self,t5_2qo7e,True,,,True,t3_poi36,http://www.reddit.com/r/theoffice/comments/poi36/does_anyone_else_want_the_office_to_end/,

It would've gone out with a bang and probably would've been known as one of the greatest TV comedies of all time.

He seems miserable throughout the episode.  He's fired.  The girl he loves (stalks) wants nothing to do with him, he's irrelevant.  He's literally balling while dancing with Pam at Dwight's wedding.

I'm hoping something was left out due to time restraints because he didn't even have a final ""talking head"" like everyone else.

Either that, or it's part of the joke that Toby ends up miserable...but somehow I don't think that seems right.

I was just watching the ""Dwight's Christmas"" episode and when Dwight was dressed up as that weird Santa, he'd hit the naughty people with his broomstick. He only hits three people. The first is Oscar and we all know why he would be considered ""Impish"" (He slept with Angela's husband). The second person he hits is Jim (Jim is leaving Dwight and that makes Dwight mad). The third is Kevin. The scene starts and it shows Dwight sorta prodding at Kevin. It also shows Kevin laughing while being prodded. It then pans away to Jim and in the background you can hear Dwight say, ""Stop laughing this is supposed to be a punishment."" 

Now, why should we know only the reasons for two outta three? Why would Dwight be mad at Kevin?

The more popular theory is Toby. It would explain why he is so obsessed with the case. Most serial killers hate it when other people get credit for their work. 

[Here's](http://imgur.com/3BxirDw) a sinister picture of Kevin to set the mood. And yes, after considering this theory, my viewings of The Office have been weird. Kinda creepy, actually.

My question - why would the pilot episode of this documentary have anything to do with Andy or Angela' s senator husband? 

Andy shouldn't be on the show until the third year, Angela is with Dwight at the beginning- Jim and Pam aren't even dating yet. So why would the reviewers know any of these details? Wouldn't they be gigantic spoilers for their 8 year documentary?

I picked the office back up on season 5 after a ~2 year hiatus and had a conversation with my friend because he wasn't a fan of the show, believing it was pointless. Soon after, I tried to look deeper into the show to find some sort of meaning and came to the conclusion that it's actually a love story between Pam and Jim, disguised as a comedy. 

(SPOILER ALERT)

Following that up, after catching up and watching today's episode and witnessing what I believe to be the saddest moment in The Office history (1/24/13) (it actually brought tears to my eyes), I believe that it would be interesting if this actually sparked the downfall of their relationship and the series ended in their divorce. Now, I know fans of The Office generally love this gorgeous couple, as do I, but I have to admit that conclusion would be an incredible twist to the story and make it a work of art.

We've come to the conclusion that it might be Dwight, but I've been seeing differing opinions. We found a few pieces of evidence that support our claim.

* In Test the Store (S08E17), Dwight is talking to Jim and says ""Look at this face. This is not the face of a performer, this is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die.""
* In Doomsday (S08E06), Dwight jokes that his password is 'ScrantonStrangler666', and is seen at his farm later in the episode, digging a grave for a 'horse'. 
* He has had many other issues that disregard human life, such as setting the office on fire, holstering and firing a loaded gun while he was acting manager, and savagely cutting the face off of a mannequin.
* He even went as the Strangler for Halloween in season 7. 
* When Toby explains that he doesn't believe that the man that was tried as the Scranton Strangler was guilty, Dwight begins playing music to cut off his speech.
* In S01E02, Mr. Brown gives the acronym H.E.R.O., and Dwight doesn't agree with his definition of Hero. Dwight says ""A hero kills people..."" He pauses here, before continuing on with his explanation. After his speech, he says to the camera, ""We all have a little hero in our hearts.""

Do you guys have any other pieces of evidence or other guesses as to who it may be?

* I learned I shouldn't do it. “@andrewfreeman04: have you learned anything about accounting after playing an accountant for several seasons?”

* Possibly like a baby. “@JonasmommySara: @BBBaumgartner are you going to cry when The Office is over?”

* When he was Santa and I sat on his lap “@nicholas_paul: @BBBaumgartner favorite scene you've done with Steve Carell?”

* I love you too “@LanaRodz: Is there any possibility that Steve Carrel is going to make an appearance in this last season? Ps iloveyou”

* Resume avail upon request.“@AndrewsWorbys: Hey Brian will you be doing any more directing now that you have done an episode of The Office?”

* Yes. Can't say what or I might get caught “@ar2: @BBBaumgartner Are you planning on stealing anything from the office on your last day?”

* The people. Not just the ones you see- but the crew alot “@__geraldineee: @BBBaumgartner what are you going to miss the most of The Office?”

* He might find a new home. “@DJPhillips913: @BBBaumgartner @ar2 gotta steal the Homer Simpson. I would buy that doll.”

I'm expecting DM to conduct interviews and that's where the big names come in. Eventually Andy will get the job.

1342575417.0,5,self.theoffice,wqh65,Jim Halpert is an asshole,thegoldar,72,67,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/theoffice/comments/wqh65/jim_halpert_is_an_asshole/,"Please forgive me if this is a repost, but I came to share a thought I had about Jim Halpert's character earlier today.

We all love Jim. He's funny, smart, good-looking, gets the girl - basically the embodiment of what guys would want to have as an experience in an office setting to be. Almost every guy who watches The Office would want to be Jim Halpert.

But there's a catch: Jim Halpert is an asshole.

I know this is blasphemy, but hear me out before you downvote me to the seventh level of Reddit hell. 

Think about what Jim's character does, especially early on. He encourages Michael's antics (to a certain extent), knowing that the rest of his coworkers found them irritating. He did the same to Dwight, also pulling pranks on him constantly, inhibiting Dwight's ability to work efficiently (example: removing his desk and replacing it with wrapping paper). He continuously hit on Pam, knowing she was engaged to Roy, leading to their broken engagement and Roy's self-destruction. One day he got most of his co-workers to shirk off work to have mock-Olympics. The list goes on.

If you take away the witty humor, all this would look pretty dick-ish to someone who was watching the show for the first time.

But despite his obvious dark side, we still love him because of the reasons stated above, and that the character is genuine. If you met a real-life Jim Halpert, you'd want to be friends with him. He would greet you with a warm smile and a firm handshake. You'd be able to have a beer and joke around with the guy.

His honesty and relate-ability are the only things that keep him from being labeled a jerk-off, in my opinion. Don't get me wrong - he's one of my favorites. The character is well-written, well-acted, and a great addition to the show.

But there's a dark side to him that if you watch for, you can see. It's quick and easy to miss, like a little glint in his eye that he knows what he's doing is wrong but doesn't care. That Jim Halpert does what he wants, when he wants and no one will get in his way. That little twinkle is the sign Dark Jim is going to rear his head and lay a path of not working, relationship breaking, and instigating widespread destruction.

Ok, maybe that last bit was a little too intense, but you get my drift. Eventually he grows out of most of it, but especially early on...Jim was definitely an asshole force to be reckoned with.

**TL;DR - Jim does mean things. A lot.**

The one thing that's really bothering me so far though, is I always thought Michael Scott was just a lovable loser.  That people didn't like him cause he just tried too hard and was just socially off, but what I'm realizing is he is those things, but he's primarily just an asshole.  He makes his employees do all his work, he's pretty racist/sexist, I mean... some of the things he does really make me cringe.  Michael is starting to become less funny and more of an annoyance.

But I feel like it's good and all that Jim &amp; Pam appear to be back to their old selves and happy. And Pam questioned whether that was enough for him. He said she was all he ever needed. But should that be the end of that? Everything ends happily ever after for Jim &amp; Pam? I hope they dive deeper into it. 

Jim goes back to being a paper salesman, passing up on his dream job, because Pam wanted to stay being a paper saleswoman and didn't want to give Philly a chance to let Jim live out his dream job.  I feel like if she really loved him, she'd let the Athlead job play out. They've had Jim mention wasting his life away at Dunder Mifflin many times throughout the series. I just think if they don't touch further on this, and put a happily ever after ending to it without delving in deeper would be very disappointing.

Either in bed together, or watching it at the same time while talking online. After we broke up, we continued to watch it for about half a season (season 7). Then we just sort of stopped talking entirely. I stopped watching The Office because it felt... weird to watch alone, and also weird to start watching it with my current girlfriend. Both because she has never watched it before, and because it was something that was such a ritual with my ex.

Finally, I gave in and watched all the episodes I had missed. It felt awful to watch them by myself. Empty.

They try to hide it very well, with all the laughs and affirmation of the rest of the office, but it's obvious to me now.

Let's compare:

Dwight is pretty much a straightforward guy, yeah he is pretty naive and he can be a little too much on the side of anal, but in general he is just living life the best way he can, and he is enjoying it. 

Meanwhile, Jim and Pam are constantly attacking Dwight for no reason what-so-ever.  Remember that Pam is throwing stuff into his coffee cup when he is not at his desk? Wtf? What kind of person does that? Imagine if your coworker did that to you.

The episode where Jim threw a snowball at Dwight's **face** indoors, for no reason made me cringe. That ball was thrown with force too, I mean if you think of it in a cartoon way, it may be funny but in the real world it freaking sucks. His glasses may have gotten damaged, his clothes got wet, maybe even his paperwork etc etc. And afterwards he is surprised that there are consequences? Oh wow, what a surprise.

There are many many such occasions, Jim hid Andy's cellphone for example. Just because he has an annoying ringtone? How about you ask him nicely to stop, and explain that it annoys you before you completely freak out and escalate?

Plus, Jim constantly looks into the camera like a smug asshole, eyebrows up like ""wow look at that"". Really, you think Michael is such an idiot? Well, he is trying to be a cool guy, a nice boss and a friend. That's more than you could say of most of the world. Instead Jim does absolutely nothing all day.

Recently a tvchannel in my country start broadcasting ""The Office"" and starting watching what i think was the first season.

I watched all the season and fell in love totally with the series, i really like the Jim and Pam couple and they are gonna get married soon!, the weird Dwight and Angela couple and their problems with that annoying guy who plays the sitar and banjo (i dont remember his name), also Michael Scott remembers me total douchebag racist boss i hated.

So i decided to try to buy all the seasons in dvd/bluray but i couldnt find them, and i cannot buy them online so i decided to download on torrent.

And today is my free day from job so i started watching the second season and i was like ""Wtf happened?"", you know Pam is with that jock and Jim is really sweet and trying to get more closer to pam before trying anything, also he is dating that girl who try to sell purses in the office.

Whatever, i just feel like im watching a ""Precuel To The Office"" and having a good time.
