1361842249.0,228,self.aves,198a48,12 Types of People Everybody Hates at an EDM Show,The_Turbinator,280,52,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/198a48/12_types_of_people_everybody_hates_at_an_edm_show/,"Most people go to EDM shows to dance and have a good time with friends...however these sub-species of people go with different motives. 
 
**1) “The Grinch”** – Nobody really knows why the Grinch attends EDM shows, for the Grinch has a severe allergic reaction to dancing or enjoyment. They can generally be found standing in the crowd, arms crossed, with an ugly frown on their face.  Any attempts to communicate with the Grinch will result in a blank stare, and more frowning. 
 
**2) “The PTOT”** - aka the ""Prostitute Toddler"" – You’re not sure how these girls got past security at an 18+ show, but  you're positive if you get too close Chris Hanson is going to stage-dive into the crowd with a camera crew to bust you.  Living on a strict diet of kandi bracelets, ecstasy tablets,  and Vick's Vaporub, the PTOT is characterized by lack of age-appropriate clothing, dilated pupils, and the assumption that everybody at the show is a drug dealer.  Even after breast feeding stops at around age 11, PTOTs continue to live with an oral fixation for most of their lives, and even attract their mates from afar with a ritualistic blinking pacifier. The potential mate responds by offering a lolipop or other sucker-type candy that the two will share while having coitus in the middle of the dancefloor. An interesting statistic is that over 75% of the applicants to MTV's Teen Mom series actually classfied their race as ""PTOT"".
 
**3) “The Zombie”** - The Zombie feeds on substances named only by random assortments of letters and numbers, which subsequently leave them without most of their brain function. They can usually be found staring at the nearest bright object without blinking, mouths hanging open, and doing a dance which can be best described as a bad recreation of the original Thriller music video. Occasionallly the Zombie will attempt to speak, not realizing the general crowd population cannot understand their incomprehensible zombie dialect comprised of a series of moans and grunts. 
 
**4) “The Crowd Salmon”** – Thought to have evolved from the common river salmon, these people are biologically driven to do anything to get to the front of the crowd. Sometimes linking arms with other Crowd Salmons in long chains, they will generally leave a path of carnage and devastation in their wake.  Once the Crowd Salmon has reached their front-most “spawn” point, they are crushed against the barricade until near suffocation, requiring rescue from the nearest bouncer to pull them over the barrier. After rescue, they are then returned to the rear of the crowd where they can begin their journey again.
 
**5) “The Bitch”** – The Bitch is extremely cool and beautiful. Do not be fooled into thinking they are normal humans, for should you generously offer the Bitch some of your water, gum, or candy, dance too close, or attempt any form of communication, she more than likely will immediately react with a disgusted look and migrate to another spot to exude her bitchy greatness elsewhere.  
 
**6) “The SuperDanceBro”** - The SuperDanceBro, is generally found at a show shirtless, or wearing a bright colored lacrosse pinny.  Traveling in packs, the SuperDanceBro establishes his dominance to his fellow DanceBros by loudly exclaiming how hard they are “rolling face” while fist-pumping wildly in an attempt to attract their nearest female counterpart (see “The Bitch”).  Do not dance too close during this mating ritual, for they have been known to sponteously begin ""moshing"" anybody within a 10 foot radius with little provocation.
 
**7) “The Plower”** - The Plower, a close relative of the Crowd Salmon, will do anything to escape the crowd. Thought by some to be the metamorphosis of “The Bitch” after consuming too much alcohol, the population is largely made up of drunk females, usually appearing to be on the brink of falling on their face and vomitting on themselves. Counter to common logic, rather than weaving through open spaces to get out faster, they are naturally prone to running directly into other attendees during their escape. Other skills in their attack arsenal include pushing, shoulder shoving, and knocking $4 water bottles out of people’s hands.
 
**8) “The Cryer”** – Originally thought to feed off sadness and the frustration of others, researchers now believe The Cryer is actually fueled almost completely by attention. While first appearing to be a regular show goer, as soon as companions of the Cryer begin to enjoy themselves, they will react by bursting into tears and drawing as much attention to itself as possible until everybody they came with is as miserable as they are before stopping. Studies have suggested the best method for avoiding a Cryer's happiness draining power is to look them directly in the eye, put one of your hands on their shoulder, and say in a stern, confident voice, ""If you don't stop crying, I am going to tell the bouncer I saw you hiding a large bag of methanphetamines in your ass."" Then promptly walk away.
 
**9) “The Plier”** – Still baffling to researchers is the mysterious Plier. A cross-breed of the Plower and the Cryer, the Plier will casually work its way to the front of the crowd before it suddenly bursts into tears. At this moment they will latch on to their nearest friend before barreling towards the back of the venue at full force. If you ever see one of these coming through the crowd, get out of the way!  Not only will they run into you with the force of an NFL linebacker while you're minding your own business without remorse, they leave a toxic trail of bad vibes and behind them.
 
**10) “The Mau5keteer”** – The Mau5keteer worships their beloved mouse leader by wearing obnoxiously large homemade mouse heads, and blocking as many people as possible from seeing the lightshow.  Mau5keteers can be spotted at any show or festival, regardless if Deadmau5 is actually playing.  When unsatisfied with the total blocking radius (TBR) of their head, they will generally lend their head to the nearest (see “PTOT”) and hoist them onto their shoulders to maximize the TBR.
 
**11) “The HumpStar""** – The HumpStar's only dance move is rubbing their body against another HumpStar in a circular motion.  They will generally seek out the most inconvenient place to do this, ensuring they are constantly bumping their ass into as many people around them as possible. 
 
**12) “The Milk Carton Kid”** – The Milk Carton Kid is always looking for their lost friend Molly. They do not actually listen to the music at the show, for they are are so distraught they are unable to have any fun until they find her. Police still have no leads to her whereabouts.

It's true that it's changed but honestly parties these days are generally as good as when I entered the scene in 2000. Just understand that you will see things very differently at 30 as opposed to 18. That's OK though, but some people don't adjust well. 

Generally the old heads don't realize how negative we sound when preaching so cut us some slack. If someone is really being malicious and trying to ruin your fun intentionally (sadly I've witnessed this), remind them at least you're not old! That's a stinger. ;) 

Ok I will say the music and fashion were better. Come on, I have to be a little jaded after 13 years. :D The decor, themes, locations, number of, sound systems and variety of parties is better now in my area than in 2000. Thank god $5 bottled water and foam orgies err parties are still passé. 

1 final word...if you are really Plurry and hugging the world these days, remember there are assholes everywhere--in the rave scene too. Be careful of trusting people just because they wear kandi or see you at parties. Some bassheads are complete takers; be skeptical and smart about buying party accessories and watch men around intoxicated female attendees. Keep an eye on each other, stay hydrated and trust your instincts.

The driver was tired and fell asleep at the wheel. She killed one of the passengers. 

You should always keep blankets, a comfort pad and maybe a compression pillow in your trunk as well as $50 emergency money **that you never spend on anything else and replace immediately if you do.** ""Wasting"" money on a cheap motel to save your life, that of your friends as well as innocent strangers is only a ""waste"" if you can justify losing a friend or plowing into a 6 year old and leaving him/her crippled is worth less than $50. [note: the 6 year old thing is something I am just adding here as a hypothetical.]

It's not worth it. It's not. I know you think it won't happen to you. Guess what? I am 100% certain that every person who dozed off was sure they could make it. I am 100% sure they all believe it was the worst decision they ever made....  If they are even alive to regret it. This isn't just a rave issue but it's more frequent due to our scene dynamics. 

**you cannot control the body's need for sleep. It is an essential function for survival. No amount of coffee, Adderall,  cocaine, vyvanse, crystal meth, loud music, cold air or splashes of water makes it safe. Your reaction time will still be shit; potentially worse than a drunk driver. Also, even meth addicts can nod off after shooting up due to micro-sleep. THIS CANNOT BE STOPPED OR CONTROLLED BY WILL POWER.**

Beg, borrow or steal if you have to to get to a place to sleep. Hell, snooze in a god damn porta-potty if you have to. Because one hellacious nap and endless internet mockery is certainly worth all the joy you'd miss if you were dead or in jail. There is no ctrl+z in life.

She's not big on raving like myself and (playfully) makes fun of my dancing and outfits whenever I'm headed out to a show. She doesn't usually come with me, but since she knows Diplo is kind of an idol of mine and the show was the day before my birthday, she wanted to be there with me to make it special.

The show was insane. They played a crazy fucking set and I loved every minute of it. Even my gf, who isn't in to that kind of music at all, was incredibly impressed. But the moment that most reminded me of why I love these shows came when the encore started. It was after midnight so technically my birthday, and Major Lazer started playing ""Keep It Goin' Louder"", probably my favorite song of theirs, and when it got to the chorus (""girl, I wanna party with you..."") I turned and sang it to her while we danced, then I kissed her. A random guy a few people away looked over and saw what happened, then started yelling ""THAT IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THINGS I'VE EVER SEEN! Seriously, beautiful!"" My gf and I just laughed, but I definitely felt like the stranger was right.

So sorry if it seems like I'm getting sappy, but it reminded me of one of the reasons I love EDM culture.",,False,self,t5_2rev7,False,,,True,t3_1alz0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/1alz0r/a_reminder_of_why_i_love_edm_shows/,

1. Try dancing to songs you DON'T know. Not just for the headliner, but for every DJ that is up there trying to get the night going.
2. DJs are on facebook and twitter. Also soundcloud. Each of these places allow you to contact them. Post songs on their wall, message them what you are diggin. If they enjoy listening to music, they will listen to it, I swear. I know I do.
3. When a DJ you dig posts a new mix, give them feedback other than one word exclamations like ""yeeah"" or ""daaaank""! Tell them what track you like off of it, which you've been repeating non stop, or even suggest tracks for another mix. Trust me, the good DJs listen to what you have to say. Some of the nerdier ones actually like talking about music. I know I do!

Just a few helpful tips to get you more proactive in the clubbing experience. This may help alleviate some of the boredom you feel waiting for the next bandwagon to jump on. It may also help you get off bandwagons entirely!

Police departments are getting aware that they can easily get a list of underground parties/shows to bust using the internet. Let's use good judgement and the private message function of reddit and keep everyone having a good night.

1354928308.0,86,self.aves,14h453,I kinda appreciate older ravers. Here's why...,Jovial_Gorilla,102,16,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/14h453/i_kinda_appreciate_older_ravers_heres_why/,"Sometimes people get all sketched out by people over 30, sometimes even older than 25 at massives. Unless they're saying or doing something unseemly to you, I couldn't think of a good reason why you'd not want them there. In fact, I couldn't think of anything less PLUR than wanting the old school partiers out of the scene, especially if they genuinely love the music!

My list of why I like them:

- They know what's up, they know how to make sure others are safe, and are often the first to speak up and do something when a person does something that breaks PLUR.

- If you're new, **they'll teach you everything that they can** in ""crash course"" mode very quickly. This includes form talking to people, how to trade kandi, and the meaning of PLUR and why it's so important.

- They are almost ALWAYS very well... *ahem* connected to the **right** people.

- They're usually the nicest people there (in my personal experience), and if you're younger and nice back, they'll return the kindness in spades.

- **I want to think that I can keep doing this for a long time.** Seeing them there makes me really happy because it lets me know that there's a place for me if I want to dance and feel some love with people who love the same music that I do.

I was in a really rough place personally before I got into the scene. When I went to my first massive, I was treated like a close, personal friend of people that I hand't even met. I was also thinking about the entire world in a far more positive light than I ever had before.

I try to pay it forward everywhere I go when I go to massives myself now, giving people their first kandi, making people have enough water, making sure people have all the proper party materials, etc.

:)

I need your help in making the dance music scene even more fun for all of us. We can make each show that you go to ""the best show ever"" We can meet even more people, bring even better vibes. What I am saying is, turn around. Thats it. When you are at the rave and dancing, turn around. You do not have to watch the DJ push buttons and turn knobs and waiting for the bass to drop just to jump up and down or fist pump. You can turn around, dance, meet people around you and not let the DJ control the ENTIRE show. You can actually DANCE with the PEOPLE AROUND YOU. The first time, it will feel weird or awkward but remember that is where the story of life is good. It is really fun and I highly recommend you giving it a shot. When theres a group of people all dancing together it's an awesome primitive feeling that really hits the soul of the being. Just give it a shot and feel the epicness  of dancing with 1 - 100s of people. I've been part of raves where the entire crowd is getting down and those are my favorite.

Who's ready to spread the PLUR love? PLUR packages are for sending some rave goodies to fellow ravers elsewhere in the world! This is a way to share your beautiful kandi or artwork and some fun toys with a new member of your rave family! This isn't just for reddit, I'm going to be advertising it to my rave family and friends and I hope you do the same! The more the merrier! Just send your friend to this page so they can get all the information! If you want to send or recieve reddit related gifts then let me know and I will do my best! 

I ask that all of your PLUR packages are worth recieving. No one wants to get a half-ass gift when they put their heart into theirs. So please, make something YOU would want to recieve (:

Start with a Kandi cuff and some singles and build from there!
*This regulates the packages so everyone get's a cuff*

**Suggestions for your perfect PLUR package:**
Kandi! (cuffs, rings, necklaces, anything!)
LED toys (rings, binkys, etc)
Letters! If anything you send has a story with it, write it down and send it along! Or write about an amazing rave experience you just need to share! 
Artwork. If you would like to send specific boy/girl items let me know and I'll do my best to match you correctly (: These are SUGGESTIONS and by no means requirements. Fill your package with what you see fit

There is no item limit/requirement. The point isn't to fill this with pricey things, it's to share your culture with another raver and share the love. Make your package something worth trading; something you would want to receive and others would feel is equally amazing as what they sent. 

**REPRESENT YOUR CITY/STATE**
Maybe make a kandi bracelet with your town on it, or whatever your beautiful mind can think of!

**The goal is to share your culture** with someone new. Make the best PLUR package you can and someone will be very happy with it (: 

**SUBMISSIONS:**
Send your first name (or raver name) and your address for the package to be sent to to [secretsantaplurpackage@gmail.com]

I will email each of you a randomly selected submission on December 16th for you to send your PLUR package to. Please keep in mind you will be paying for shipping/handling. Anyone can participate no matter your country. If you're out of the US I'll try to match you with someone close to you! Or if you want you can request to trade with someone from another country! If I can't match you with someone within your country and it's not requested to go international I'll ask who I match you with first to make sure prices of shipping/handling is okay. 

**DEADLINE will be DECEMBER 15th!** 

If you have any questions and are directed to this as a non-redditor ask me through the email

Peace, Love, and Unity
-Plur Santa
Edit: Please include your full name (mailing purposes) Rave/nickname if you'd like, mailing address, gender, and any requests (: 

**PLEASE share! Let's see how many people we can get! Just in the first day I've gotten almost 40 submissions! Let's keep 'em coming!!**

**Edit** *Two new pieces of information!* **One!** If you would like to have the chance and possibly meet up with your secret Santa include your town and/or raves coming up that you know you're going to. I can try to match you up within the same town, though the point of this is to trade with people you would otherwise not trade with. But it's up to you! This could be a way to extend not only your distant PLUR family but your close rave family as well! **Two!** Unfortunately this is relying on the honor system. If you happen to be matched with a ""bad egg"" I am truly sorry and hope it doesn't happen to any of you! I just ask everyone is respectful and really supports spreading peace love and unity and sends the best package they can. I will set up a page after the 16th for those of you who would like to share about their recieved packages! Again, thank you to everyone participating! 

**My goal is for this to get worldwide, especially to Europe! So make sure you spread the word! (:**

**Edit:** If you want to give your match a chance to choose a cuff/piece out of a few options to really their taste and bring the most satisfaction you can include a picture for me to forward with the address. You don't have to rush to try to get a picture of your kandi for options though. The email puts all conversations together so you can add a picture closer to the deadline. That way you still have plenty of time to make your kandi pieces (:

*Note* I will include email, name and address along with gender, coming raves they'll be attending, and other relative details as they are provided

**Edit: YES this is still happening! I'm waiting for all the submissions to come in so I can match those who have requests as best I can! Sorry for the wait! I'm thinking about moving the deadline back a couple days to Wednesday the 12th. What do you guys think? If I get enough responses saying I should move the deadline back I will start matches then, but still accept submissions through the 15th! Thank you for your patience! (:**

I'm in my early 20's and too many of my friends that I've gone to shows with for years are telling me that they're suffering from Tinnitus, or a constant ringing in their ears.  

I know I'd be lying if I said that I thought that my hearing was nearly as good as when I started going to shows, and I've never been a ""let's hang out right next to this massive speaker"" kind of guy.

You can get a quality pair of earplugs for $8-$12 on Amazon and they ship in about 2 days. 

Mine just arrived and I'm very happy with them on first impression.  They fit comfortably, my music still sounds very clear, and I can hold a conversation easily.

I bought some molly from a new guy about a week before hand, and he was like ""Be careful with this man, it's strong"" and I was like ""yeah yeah, whatever, all drug dealers say that"" and didn't really take him very seriously. I did notice when capping it how pure white and fluffy and chunky it was, moreso than any molly I've ever seen before. 

I ended up taking ~350mg of it in a capsule 1 hour before I got to the venue, and a white Pokeball I found hiding in a shoebox in my closet. I have an obnoxiously high tolerance to MDMA for some reason, despite spacing it out 3-6 months between rolls. 300-400mg is usually one dose for me so this wasn't unusual. Things started out okay, I was like ""Yay I'm coming up, I sure do love rolling"" but then very quickly turned into ""OH SHIT OH GOD WHAT IS HAPPENING"" and basically all at once it got way too intense, way too fast. It's the only time I can ever recall being uncomfortably high on MDMA. I got delirious, I didn't know where my friends went, where I was in the venue or where I was trying to go, and stumbling over stairs and chairs like I was super drunk. It was really bizarre how quickly it happened, it felt like a dream more than reality.

I must have looked as bad as I felt because I got to the bathroom and all the bros interrupted their conversations about ""omg dude, i'm rollin so hard, yeah dubstep!!"" to be like ""holy shit, look at this guy!! are you okay man?!"" and I don't know if I really responded or not. One guy came over to me, grabbed the water bottle out of my back pocket, filled it in the sink, and was like ""Bro. BRO!! Drink some fucking water dude, right now. I'm serious"" and he made me chug a couple bottles of water and then sit down on a couch and chill out for a bit until I started coming back down to reality and regain my bearings. I must have been mostly dehydrated because I felt much better pretty soon after that, I told him I felt better and he left, and I didn't have any issues at all the rest of the night.

I have no idea who that guy was, or if I'll ever meet him again. I'm really grateful for him though. I've been going to raves for 7 years, I don't have the excuse of being a dumb newbie who doesn't know what he's doing. I got cocky and wreckless with drug use, and it took a scary close call to bring it to my attention. I'm definitely going to go slow and aim low any time I try a new substance from now on. Be careful /r/avers!!

**Table of Contents**
Introduction
- a bit about FB

- A) Outdated method
        
- B) How to Get Floods of invites on FB 

- C) Reading Invites for Clues / Evaluating Potential Raves.

**Introduction**
So there are frequent post asking where the parties are for each city. While I/We don't mind helping, I thought I'd write this in the spirit of ""teach a man to fish..."" These tips will help for almost any major North American city...YMMV in other countries or smaller scenes...

First and foremost....no one, I REPEAT, no one was born knowing this stuff. If you encounter attitude when asking legit questions....just remember someone taught that jerk too and they are obviously insecure. We all had to learn. 

**Facebook**
I hate saying this...but it's true: Facebook is required. The only reason I joined FB is for events. It still makes me feel icky...but you will work 3 times as hard to find 1/3 of the possibilities without it.

You may want to make a fake name or alternate account because you're going to be ""liking"" stuff you may not necessarily truly dig.

**Section A The Outdated Method**
On the extremely unlikely chance your city still has a record store that sells DJ vinyl...Bam! Go check there and the community bulletin should have stuff posted. Related to that, in the college areas /artsy districts of town, check the funky coffee shops, 2nd hand book stores, vintage clothes boutique. Generally you're looking for independent business, particularly clothing or music related that serves a mostly college aged clientele. You may discover a stack of flyers or posted events on cork board. 

BUT

These days I def would NOT make a special trip to do this as it is unlikely to yield much...but if you're nearby or doing some shopping keep your eyes open. That's more how we did it back in the era of dinosaurs. 

**Section B, How to Get a Flood of Invites**
Now for FB, you kind of need to use some google-fu to get started. Whenever you get any piece of possibly useful info...go ""like"" the related page. We are just trying to get you invited to stuff. If you're not sure if something is ravey vs a really bad college night...I'll cover that below, in Section C just ""like"" it for now.

A good place to start is google. ""DJ DnB [your city]"" I don't care if you're a junglist or not...here's why:

DnB almost always tied to events with no dress code, 18 plus instead of 21+, often more ""underground""---a loaded term but whatever--events. If you can go and like a few active local DnB DJs, they will most certainly post gigs they're at. If you have no interest in this genre, check places they are playing  with multi-rooms or diverse line-ups to get the other local DJ names as well. 
""Like"" any that are listed as EDM genres. Also, ""like"" any photographers that have a fan page and post shots of raves, vendors possibly AND DEFINITELY THE PROMO CREW throwing the party as well as the venue. 

The reason you don't want to start searching. ""DJ House [your city]"" is house can be booked at very strict dress code clubs, or very non-ravey events. It's much more difficult to tell. 

Now this should start opening doors for you. If you find that you ""liked"" a promo crew and they look promising, check their timeline for past events. If they have tons of pics of kids with kandi and blue hair, go ""like"" any past venues where they've thrown successful parties. Check these past host venues upcoming schedules too...there may be a solo act like Madeon coming through. 

Furthermore, liking the venues may get you invites from other worthwhile promo crews.


Do not decline events early in this game, just select ""maybe "" if you aren't going to go. 
-----------

**Section C Reading Invites for Clues / Evaluating Potential Raves.**

So...now you're getting tons of invites...but how do you know the difference from the Jersey Shore Fan Club-Clubs and decent events?

- Again, check the promo company/ies listed. Look at pics from past events. Read the comments on old event pages and look at the profiles of a few people that liked them. 

- If you see a DJ(s) listed as Top 40 or House/Moombahton/Top 40 9/10 it will be more Frat House than Funky House.

Other red flags : 
- 18 for women/ 21 for men. - Dress to impress.
- Free/discounted with a college ID. 
- Hip-Hop in another room (hip-hop is played at some raves but usually because the DJ is a turntabilist...and will be listed as such or a ""DMC"" winner or finalist etc. ) 
- No mention of ""no weapons no drugs.""--Seems only added to rave flyers/event descriptions
- Any kind of description of ""upscale lounge"" VIP bottle service, or ""sexiest grooves.""
- No links to soundcloud/or other music promo pages.

These red flags are by no means perfect. I've been to many great events that broke 1 or 2 of the aforementioned rules. But 3-4 together is usually a strong sign. 

When in doubt...check it out. You can always drive by a venue and scope the line and decor. Usually that will tell you all you need to know. If it looks cool, go take a gamble. If its the wrong crowd, keep working on your list. 

If you really, really just need to get a peek inside, mention that your friend left her keys there the other night. Can you go check lost and found? No matter where the LnF is you should have enough of a chance to see who is going in, what kind of music is playing etc.


Hope this helps. Drink lots of water, keep an eye on each other and consider starting a journal to record the events you attend. 

One final tip...remember that at every moment you are responsible for your own happiness. You always have a choice to be 100% in charge of your reaction, thoughts and perceptions of any moment. Never give that power away to other people or inanimate external factors.

Happy Raving!

And I need to know if maybe this is just me or if other r/avers think this is becoming a bigger and bigger problem.

I have NO problem with people wearing shirts/tanks/hats/shades with big neon printing that says, like, ""RAGE"" or ""LETS PARTY"" or any derivation of that. Even YOLO... although that is my least favorite one. I personally wouldn't wear those (I like making my own shirts), but if you do, that's fine, whatever, it's your style, have fun.

But can we please stop wearing shit that says ""Where's Molly?"" or ""HAVE YOU SEEN MOLLY"" or ""R U ROLLIN"".... ""Sex Drugs and Dubstep"" is barely tolerable to me. It's not a direct reference to any specific drug.

Yes, the drug scene is obviously prevalent in EDM culture. Yes, I have partaken before. But why do we have to commercialize and advertise something that needs to be a VERY small, trivial part of EDM music? You don't HAVE to find Molly to enjoy EDM, and when people who are newcomers to the scene see shit like that, they see us as nothing more than pill heads looking for their nightly fix.

We are pushing something like this into public light, solely for commercial and popular/social gain. This weekend at the festival I attended I saw a girl with a white balloon that said ""Where Is Molly?""... I mean come on seriously? A balloon. 

 In my opinion it can only hurt our community and It makes me sad to see people wearing that stuff. Because then others think it's okay, and more and more people are wearing it, and doing it, and soon enough that's all EDM will be known for. 

Just use your heads, people. Do I have a valid point? Anybody else feel this way??

Sneaking into raves at 16, being the ""mall junkies"", making kandi while getting high all night and laughing our faces off, basement parties of terrible shuffling in big crazy pants...it was just growing up and sharing everything with friends that all came from the same place at that time in our lives.  All of these things just helped us show who we really were and who we wanted to be.  Yeah, everyone labeled us as the ""weirdos"", but we were weirdos with true love for one and other.  We were the weirdos that had no problem wearing neon colored bracelets with dumb sayings on them because it represented our good times that we didnt want to lose.  We had an escape when things got bad.  I'm now 22 years old.  I work everyday and I attend events/raves on the weekends.  I still wear kandi and blast trance, hardstyle, happy trance (like ive been doing since 8:30 this morning, since I'm off work today lol) everyday. It represents my individuality and so much more.  Going to raves now and hanging out with such great, open, and loving people, has made me so happy to be able to be apart of such a growing scene.  I have never seen a fight at a rave or event and its so much better then going to a club and seeing people try so hard to be the big HOT SHOT there.  Its not about who looks the best or who wears the most expensive stuff.  Its about enjoying the company of good people and great vibes.  I hope everyone keeps the true meaning of PLUR and what kandi represents, alive.

For many reasons, You're all redditors, you're all ravers, and I'm sure all of you are great people... so that's why I come to you with a friendly reminder which I'm sure most of you don't even need.

This past weekend, an ""acquaintance"" of mine fainted and threw up a little bit and was almost unresponsive and had to be hospitalized. I am not completely positive of what happened or what caused this reaction... I was told that she was almost blackout drunk when she decided to ingest some club drugs. If I was there, I honestly would have told her no to the drugs until she sobered up and drank more water.

I'm not here to bash alcohol or drug use, because hell, I know I partake in both when the occasion is right... 

But please remember a few things

* The more alcohol you drink, the less water you have
* The more substances you have, the more your judgement is thrown askew
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. I know that if I saw someone about to faint, I'd give them some of my water. (Don't be a mooch, but be aware that we are here for emergencies)
* Please be fucking careful with the drugs you take if you choose to do them. Try to buy from a trusted source... Acquire a test kit and test your drugs
* Designate a driver, or make sure you have a way to get home
* Drink.WATER.


I don't mean to bring down the general happiness of this subreddit, but the real fact is that my friend could have died this past weekend and I only wish the best on all of you.

Much love.

-Me

P.s. If anyone has anything to add, please feel free to comment :)

I live in a town with about 5000 people. Throughout the past year and a half I have been in a really bad depressive state.. to where I realized I was off track with alot of things but just gave up on caring. I work a crap fast food job, one I have left and come back to and have collectively worked at for about 4 years. To sum that all up I hate my job with a fiery passion, and on top of it I have become a recluse, shutting out everyone including my family. Spiraling downward more and more each day and feared there was no way out. 

Last fall I went to my first big rave on a whim because a friend got me a cheap ticket, and got to see some amazing groups, and danced my ass off. I made alot of friends, and was just caught in this euphoric state the whole time. The following months became me falling in love with all sorts and styles of electronic dance music, and I planned my next rave. Lucky, which was back in march, was stellar. I had an even better time, and met some sick artists. That euphoric state lasted a few days. I began to realize, that my love for music was overcoming my depression bit by bit. As I am in the midst of planning my 3rd big rave, (which is also my first outdoor/camping at a concert experience) a friend of mine who produces music, began talking to me about how he was looking for a roomate to produce music with. I instantly threw my name in the hat for him to consider, to which he happily agreed. 

-We are in the process of getting our first house.
-I am ecstatic to be leaving this horrid town.
-I plan to work on starting fresh in a new town.
-Edm is still a major part of my everyday routine.

I think it was the most genuine reaction to a gift I have ever recieved, and easily the kindest and most amazing gift.

TAO 2010, it took me literally three hours to come up, and I had been so frustrated the whole night having no idea what its supposed to feel like and wondering whether I would even end up rolling. In my frustration (and stupidity) I'd already taken two thizz and a molly before any of them had hit me. After I smoked the first weed of the night it hit me like a train, and I turned to my friend who was there with me and told him I was rolling. Like a fucking boss, he pulls some fine ass girl out of thin air, tells her it's the first moment I've ever been rolling, and asks her to give me a massage. I then proceed to get one of the best massages of all time, while getting a triple light show from my friend and two other people we met there, with the music just blasting in the background. I'll remember that moment for the rest of my life.

TL;DR: Massage + Triple Light Show + First Roll = Good Times

So what was your first time like?

It was an awesome show, everyone was having a great time, smiles all around. I was rolling (fairly hard I might say) and I was getting a lightshow around... 1am? Anyways, During the lightshow this woman (I say woman because she had to be over 35/40) pulls out her phone and starts taking a video of me... I noticed because of the camera light that stayed on. 

I motioned for her to stop by cutting my hand by my neck as in ""cut it out"" because lets be real yes I'm having a good time and enjoying myself but the last thing I want is for a video of me going melted face going viral on the interwebs. 

Anyways, she puts her phone away and then We continue with a fucking awesome light show. I get back in the groove of it, enjoying the show once again and her fucking friend pulls out her phone and starts recording me again. I stand up and say ""What the fuck are you doing? I already told your friend to stop you didn't understand that?""

She gave me a dirty look, put her camera away and they walked off. I wasn't in the mood to continue but this really bothered me. There was obviously no PLUR here, they aren't part of the scene. But at the same time, when someone tells you that they don't want to be recorded you should fucking respect it! I felt this was extremely rude and it was the only thing that bothered me all night....

Thoughts? Opinions? Should I have handled the situation differently? Has anyone else had this issue arise, what did you do about it?

EDIT: WOW I did not expect this much reaction to this. It seems like most of you agree with me that the person had no right to film me.

1294097758.0,39,self.aves,evoir,A more realistic story behind the EDC death,Lysergide25,49,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/evoir/a_more_realistic_story_behind_the_edc_death/,"I posted this in one of the TAO threads, but I think this needs to be known by more people.

Over the weekend I was at a small house party with a lot of people who live in LA and were going to TAO. I met a few people there who knew Sasha and they told me the real story behind what had happened. 

As you may know, just this weekend, the family of Sasha filed a claim seeking five million in damages related to her death, and a whole slew of accusing statements towards Insomniac. It's all bullshit, though. Insomniac literally played zero part in her death, other than the security guards not checking IDs closely. See, Sasha was one of those really scary raver-kids who go every weekend and roll hard. Her parents let her do pretty much whatever she wanted, and they knew damn well where she was going, too. She was one of those kids who popped 3-4 pills every weekend without thinking about it. Upon entering EDC, she popped four pills, drank too much water, and then popped another four pills, chugged more water, passed out, and then her friends took her off to the side and tried to revive her for about an hour before some officials saw what was happening and stepped in.

So, condolences to Sasha, but it was entirely her fault. Her friends have been trying hard to cover up the extent of the story, but ultimately they are damaging the shaky foundation that massives already stand on. Because of one underage girl acting like an idiot with parents who didn't watch their daughter carefully, and because Go-Ventures/Insomniac completely blew it with TAO this year, there's a good chance that AB-74 isn't going to get tossed out into the shitter like it should be.

Again, this story was from people who directly knew her. Perhaps certain parts of it are embellished (none of the people were actually with her, but knew her and heard the story directly from people who were there and watched the fallout), but this is what was told directly to me. 

Please, everyone, be safe and responsible out there. Massives, renegades, parties, raves, whatever the hell you want to call them - are on the way out because people aren't being careful and responsible. Massives in LA are pretty much decriminalized massive drug gatherings with good music, despite what anyone wants to try and say, and the fact that they are even allowed to go on is amazing. There is a chance here to shift a paradigm about drug usage, but instead people continue to be stupid and injure themselves, ultimately causing officials to look at events like these as a bad thing.

Please be safe. Please be careful. PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION IF YOU FEEL SICK OR BAD. PLEASE know what you are taking. PLEASE trust your source. PLEASE respect the police and security working events - they aren't there to screw you over. Please respect the venue. Please. PLEASE. Please know how MDMA and other chemicals work before ingesting any of it (nobody needs more than .5 of MDMA in an evening, NOBODY). Please, just be careful.",,False,self,t5_2rev7,False,,,True,t3_evoir,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/evoir/a_more_realistic_story_behind_the_edc_death/,

City Heat Magazine - December 1999 

""It's around midnight on a Saturday night. I'm walking with a friend down a dusty road somewhere in the middle of the desert. The full, summer moon casts our shadows in the sand as it peaks through the silvery clouds and we can barely see the silhouettes of the tall bushes that surround us. From beyond the hills, a faint sound calls to us. It's a low, heavy base that beats like a racing heart. Tribal and organic in nature, it's as timeless as the universe yet, it is completely synthesized. We stop our conversation briefly and look at each other with a smile. We're about to arrive at a rave.

Raves have been around for many years now. From the abandoned warehouses of London, to the volcanic mountain tops of Ecuador, they could pop up any where, any time. Some are as small as a private party with only a handful of people, some are as large as a big city. 1998s Love Parade in Berlin brought 3 million people together. My personal favorites are the Arizona desert raves. They get any number of ravers from fifty to five hundred or so and since the choice of music is focused on progressive techno and trance, the people who attend are generally older (by ravers standards) and more responsible and descrete partiers. But as any raver will tell you, it is impossible to categorize what a raver really is. I've met all sorts of people at raves, from underage homeless runaways to retired university professors.

Some say raves are the modern day version of the 60's and 70's hippie movement. That explanation leads one to believe that raves are nothing but a pagan ritual for the none conformist to get high, get some free love and burn out. Others say raves are a celebration of life and love and freedom through dancing all night to electronic music. But, you can get all of those things anywhere. So, what is it that truly defines and separates raves from other human rituals? I think it has a lot to do with attitude.

Remember 2001 A Space Odyssey? When a tribe of Neanderthals woke up to the giant monolith planted in their midst? Raves remind me a lot of that scene. When I watch a group of sweaty dancers rest their heads on the metallic grill of a giant, black speaker and attach their trembling chests to the gaping mouth of a pulsating woofer, I instantly remember the same ape, 2 million years ago, touching, sniffing and kissing the unfamiliar and fascinating dark object. Raves are about our future. They inspire us to become aware of ourselves, our surroundings and our humanity. They are about how we will come together as a species and how we will treat each other. They are about how we will communicate and express our thoughts and emotions to oneanother.

The music that is played at raves generally sounds meaningless and repetitive to many people. It might become extremely disturbing and intolerable and could even evoke anger and disgust. But to ravers, this music is as sweet as the air they breathe and as life giving as the blood that flows through their veins. The magic is in the feelings that techno music awakens in us. The subtle scale progressions and the rhythmic build ups excite the senses and move the spirit with such delicate touch that few classical compositions can match. At the same time, the relentless beat of the powerful base feeds such overflow of energy into the flesh that the body is lifted involuntarily in the air and hurled into a perpetual cosmic orgasm. Dancers twirl and spin into a frenzy as they spray sweat into their orbit. Dust rises from the ground with each harmonic buildup and glistening bodies emerge in a fog of vibrating particles. Laser beams pierce the darkness and Earth quakes under stomping feet. All life's problems are trampled to bits as souls rise to the heavens and primal screams escape from every single nerve end. Heads tilt up to the sky, eyes water with joy and jaws shiver with ecstasy. Once again, we prove to the world and to the skeptics that we are indeed **ALIVE**! We celebrate life with a vengence. Like I said, it's all about attitude.

We only need to remember that raves are NOT a way of life. They are a ritual. An exercise for the soul as well as the body. We need to realize that the monolith we climbed the night before was only there to inspire us. We cannot take it to work with us for moral support and we cannot hide behind it to avoid life's strict requirements. We also need to accept that not everyone can, or wishes, to be a part of our ritual. We need to respect others for choosing different paths and not be disappointed if we are not accepted by them. Despite the overwhelming strength we draw from raving, we have to be the first to admit that we're no better than anyone else. If we are to promote peace, love, unity and respect we need to accept all others before we expect them to accept us. Did I mention it's all about attitude?""

TL;DR: raving is about connecting with others, loving each other and ourselves, celebrating life, and we should remember to balance our raving with our day to day responsibilities.

I want you to tell me about the little things at raves that make you happy, all the short exchanges that when added up make these festivals so special. I'll share a few to get the ball rolling:

Coachella last year, I'm lying down on the wiggling metallic pine cone thingies with my girlfriend in my lap, rolling absolute face, when some girl walks up to us, clearly rolling balls as well but looking really stressed. She asks us if we've seen her phone, saying she was just over by these pine cones and thinks she lost it over here. Now, in my current state of mind, I wouldn't have seen her phone if it was duct taped to my forehead, but I lazily reach back behind me and lo and behold it's there. The look of pure happiness and gratitude on this girl's face was amazing, just a little moment that doesn't exactly blow your mind, but is special nontheless.

Another one would be a different time that same night, this time in the sahara tent, when I'm dancing and some random guy just walks up and plants a kiss on my cheek. Before I even have a chance to register what just happened he disappears, leaving me incredibly flustered and my girlfriend almost dying of laughter. I look over to my left and see another (different) guy with a facial expression that unmistakably says ""what the fuck just happened?"", so naturally I ask if he just got ambushed by the sneak kisser, which he did, and we laughed it off and shared a spliff. A surprise kiss on the cheek lead to a new festival friend.

There are a million more I could tell, but I wanna here about the little experiences that stuck in *your* minds fellow r/avers, so have at it.

The general stigma associated with raves and festivals is an effort at shoehorning people into clubs and concerts that exist solely to make money off you. Organizers don't want you smoking weed or rolling on E, they want you to buy their overpriced liquor and water. These promoters have the money to throw the biggest events that bring in top artists and musicians who you want to see.

Whenever someone who recognizes this has the brilliant idea to put together a concert, but keep it out of the hands security companies and liquor vendors and local government, those people get angry and they use fear to convince the general public that their children are taking drugs and dying/getting pregnant at these concerts.

This fear is reflected in the recent bannings of certain iconic rave and concert elements, such as kandy, light toys, and sitting down (around the perimeter of a venue or in groups getting lightshows). There are 'get up and dance' crews, who are just security guards who wont let you sit down. This has two effects in their eyes past their veiled claim of safety. First, they believe sitting is synonymous with taking or selling drugs. Second, if you are tired and forced to stand, you are more likely to shell out money for a drink or something. It is decisions like these by organizers that are destroying the scene, which I believe will move back underground to preserve the reasons why we go to these shows at all.

The last show i went to was a halloween rave. In actuality, it was more of a makeshift club, despite being held at some fairgrounds. Scores of dude-bro's were bussed in from adjacent colleges and hoards of bro-ho's were out looking for their one night stands. There were more bars than stages and while nobody was searched upon entry, they were taking glow sticks and light toys from everyone, saying that they were 'dangerous'. I met a guy there plastered off his ass with half a fuckin pool cue that could actually kill someone, unlike a 5"" glowstick on a shoelace that couldnt even put an eye out. If theres two things that dont go together in large groups, my vote would be for weapons and alcohol.

tldr: Just my observations...

This is intended for people of the younger generation to help get their heads around what throwing a party entails.  

More and more the rave scene is becoming commercialized and capitalized, falling away from the original warehouse parties done by a couple of kids with a couple hundred dollars.

We need more music, more venues, and more events to bolster underground growth and foster a truly Peace, Love, Unity, and Respect-oriented scene.

**You don't have to be professional or even have much money to throw a massive party.  The most important thing is networking.**

My buddies and I threw smaller underground things for a couple hundred people in high school on a shoestring budget.  

This isn't a guide for professional promoters or pretty much anyone that has ever thrown a party with more than 50 people.  I want to foster grass roots growth.  It only takes one person's initiative to spur on a movement of several crews.

Here are the most important things you will need if you want to throw a rave:
-Location/venue
-Sound and lighting
-DJ's/musicians
-Security/staff
-**Party-goer network**
-Little stuff (glowsticks, water, bracelets, tables, decorations, themed items, act.)

Rule number 1:  Everything that could ever possibly ever go wrong will go wrong.  And then more things will go wrong.  Have as many contingency plans in place as possible, and good friends to rely on WHEN you get totally fucked.  
Rule number 2:  When you go from being a raver to a promoter, all of the rave drama you've ever known will multiply tenfold.  There are people that will love you and there are people that will hate you no matter what decisions you make.  Act fairly and assertively, and be extremely careful who you make enemies with.  Politics will ensue.  

The venue will always be your worst problem.  Real concert venues around town are usually not exactly what you want.  Those can be very expensive and charge a load up front.  NETWORK!  Drive around town and call every sketchy-ass looking for lease sign until you find someone willing to let you use their building for a night for a couple hundred dollars.  ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS MAKE THEM SIGN A CONTRACT.  You can Google search contract templates and print them out in a few minutes.  If you don't do that, people WILL fuck you over and steal your money.  Location is key.  Know where your audience is located and where they'd like to go.  Sketchy isn't always bad - Though it's good to have a couple big black guys to watch your back sometimes.  Always figure out how much electricity you can get through the building.  Sound and lighting systems take insane amounts of power to run correctly, and even if you have a kickass setup, it will be weak if you don't have the juice.

Outdoor venues can be majorly rewarding.  Field raves are fucking awesome, and everyone knows that.  Temperature is a huge problem depending on the time of year.  No one wants to rave when it's 40 degrees F.  Weather can ruin your show on a moments notice.  Power is a massive problem.  You'll probably have to rent a professional-grade generator, none of that silly Home Depot stuff.  That's a few hundred at least.

Sound and lighting is another major hurtle.  Start networking again, and find someone you can rent at least two mains and two subs from.  Get the details.  Do you research.  Sign a contract.  Make SURE you can trust them (That lesson cost me two grand).  Get creative with lighting.  Foster a trippy environment if you want.

DJ's are pretty easy to get, actually.  It seems that nowadays everyone wants to be a DJ.  Most of them are pretty shitty, but I'm sure you know a few buddies that can help you out.  Gear is an issue.  See if a DJ can bring a house CDJ setup.  If not you can rent them out.  **Google is your friend**   Less is more.  Remember that DJ's are promoters, too.  If you don't have to pay them, you don't have to pay them (gas money is nice).  

At the end of the day this is all going to come down to relying on a network of people to do what they agreed to.  Most of this is going to rely on trust and friendship bonds.  You need go keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.  You need people to run the ticket booth, snack/water/glowstick booth, and some other things.  Many people just want to help.  Security is important!  You need to be conscious of who you're letting in without charging.  Sneak 50 people in, and suddenly you're short $750.  Even if you don't have legit security, make absolutely sure that you have at least two or three big guys that you can trust and rely on that can beat the shit out of anyone.  Invite photographers and dancers if possible.

Your network of friends will be the most important variable in this entire process.  It's an attractive idea to market using Facebook, flyers, and other mass-marketing strategies, but I've found that that's not very effective at a low level.  What you need is personal networking.  You need to call every single person on your contacts list and tell them about this show and get them hype about it.  Then you need to ask them to tell their friends and show up with a car full of five people.  You then need to text them once a week so they don't forget.  Facebook is a great tool over messaging (Side note:  Everything you ever type on Facebook in private messages can EASILY be made public to the people or to the cops.  Watch yourself.)  A really shitty rule of thumb I like to use is take the number of people RSVP'd as going (ignore maybies) on Facebook and divide by three.  It all comes down to personal networking.  Almost everyone that says they'll show up won't.  You'll have way less people than you hoped for - But the show will still be awesome.

Legal issues:  All raves are somewhere between totally illegal and slightly illegal.  Research the sound pollution laws in your area - Those are how most raves get shut down.  Venue licensing is important.  The bottom line is that if you attract the cops' attention, there is a good probability that they will want to shut you down.  Happens all the time, weather they have the legal power to or not.  Don't give them that chance or that reason.  Don't attract attention, even if you are ""legit""

You can throw a decent party for $1,000 if you cut corners.  Be careful and always have emergency money.  One time I had to call a long list of friends begging for a couple hundred dollars for a generator about 20 hours out from the show.  Don't be afraid to ask for favors.  

This is by no means conclusive or thorough in any way.  I just want to give you guys something to think about and a way to get started.

What I posted has more holes in it than a slice of swiss cheese at the atomic level, but the goal of this post is to get people thinking.  It's gonna take a whole lot of work, initiative, phone calls, favors, money, mistakes, and ~~bong hits~~ creativity to get a party to work.  It may be the best and worst night of your life in one.",,False,self,t5_2rev7,False,,,True,t3_14jpz1,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/14jpz1/brief_guide_to_promotingorganizingfinancing_raves/,

My friends and I all bought tickets for Starscape months ago, got all psyched for it, got dressed up, drove over an hour, arrived at 10:30 pm and were turned away at the door. Apparently the fire marshall decided that the venue was overcrowded and so they closed the gates completely for the rest of the night. None of us got to go even though we all had tickets. I've never been so disappointed. Having lived in/near Baltimore County all my life, I've been wanting to attend Starscape for years now, and the year I finally have all of my ducks in line so I could go and party with some awesome people, the event is so completely mismanaged that we were turned away even though we had tickets.

So there. Glad to get that off my chest. I'm never trying to go to Starscape again, I just can't deal with that kind of disappointment and unfairness.

I've been aware of the subreddit /r/mixes for sometime, but have found it to be more for personal/fresh producers to post mixes rather than for large, well known artists. I've seen many posts of recent sets from EDCNY or Coachella or Jambalaya Festival and yet they really had no proper place for such threads. So, I went ahead and created /r/EDMsets for Redditors to post recent sets, or even general long mixes. 

One of my main desires for this is to be able to post such sets and then in the comments list the full track listings of the sets. If no track list can be found or obtained, then users could collaborate and figure out what tracks exist within the set and in what order.

Please pay a visit and check out what's posted as well as post some sets/mixes yourself. I'd also like to know if any other subreddits like this exist. Let me know, and thanks.",,False,self,t5_2rev7,False,,,True,t3_1euan7,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/1euan7/edm_sets_subreddit/,

1359394925.0,34,self.aves,17fsqg,How to dance? or rather how to get grinded on? (also an appraisal of the possible therapeutic value of raves/music festivals).,Iamnot2sure,39,5,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/aves/comments/17fsqg/how_to_dance_or_rather_how_to_get_grinded_on_also/,"I know this is a very absurd question that will probably have an effect of causing facepalm. So while this is most definitely laugh worthy, please don't be too rough on me!

I have suffered with social anxiety my entire life, I went to my first rave/music festival about 4 years ago and I had such an amazing time I took every chance I had to get out to similar events. Sadly this was not too often over the last few years but some really interesting things happened. I found that the general free atmosphere and non judgmental culture surrounding the raves/music festivals really helped me to alleviate my anxiety/depression, and not just for the time being. I could probably graph out a decreasing general anxiety level  over the past few years directly correlating with time spent dancing at raves and feeling free just being myself.


Not for the actual question at hand. I have no problem at all letting lose and just flailing my arms around and dancing like an idiot alone, it is quite liberating and VERY fun. The only problem I have is that almost every time I have been at a rave/music festival I always make friends(not the bad part), but I often get asked to dance with someone. I would probably be better off in an old style dance like you would do in high school at prom... lol... But nevertheless dancing now days has equated to a girl just grinding on me. I have turned down a few ""dances"" saying I just like to do my own thing but the truth is I would like to participate in this particular contemporary ceremony of dancing with another. The two times I danced with someone I did not know what to do and the anxiety levels went from a -5 to a 5 pretty fast, I pretty much just stood still or sort of leaned back and forth...


So how what do I do in this sort of situation? perform like a humping motion? (lol seems silly thinking about this.) Just sort of sit still? (seems boring). Again I know this is a ridiculous question, but hopefully someone will be nice enough to answer. 

PS: sorry if this was long winded, it originally was going to be short but I got swept away in how much I am grateful for having had access to experiences that have had profound psychological impacts on myself in such a good way.

TLDR: Have suffered from Social Anxiety for my whole life, going to raves/music festivals has helped immensely. I am good while dancing alone, but add in a female dancing companion into the mix and I am not sure what to do. 

EDIT: I would like to extend a thank you to everyone who posted in this thread, I was half expecting to not get any replies at all. I honestly feel much more comfortable now and cannot wait tell the next time I get to dance with someone.

Those times when I just couldn't stop smiling, couldn't help but dance, and get chills to this very day just thinking about it.

That isn't to say that people who don't attend EDM shows live boring lives. But I think something very important and unidentifiable goes on in the midst of everything at an EDM show. Drugs or not, there is a moment (or a few moments if you're lucky) at each show where everything just seems to come together. Amidst the bass and the sweat and the dancing, suddenly you just meld with the crowd and become one giant being, being fed by the music and lights. 

I can think of no other experience in my life that has been as intense as these times. Nothing. Again, I'm not saying everyone who doesn't listen to EDM lives boring lives. I just think there are very few things in this world that even come CLOSE to that feeling of complete musical bliss. 

Thank you for listening to me, r/aves, and thank you to EDM for completely changing my life!

I absolutely love to listen to hypnotic but up-tempo music and just dance around my small room. I am never ashamed of my dancing(which is pretty self expressive), but for some reason I can't get the same feeling when I'm at an actual rave. When I'm at home, there's a great peaceful feeling that just comes on to me. My body just makes the most beautiful expressive moves and I'm really get into the music, feeling lightheaded.

Of course I will pick a rave above dancing at home, but the amount of self expression when at home is just awesome. It's like writing, or drawing. I know many people dance at home, but I just think I, and I think /r/aves too, enjoys it on a whole other level.

Any other fans of making art with your body at home?

Here's what I know so far:

* It was a very underground thing where you'd get invites from people at music stores and they never really got bigger than 1000 people.

* It wasn't as much of a ""scene"" as it is in today's sense, as in people weren't rushing to go just to say they went.

* People were supposedly friendlier back in the day.

* They were held in warehouses instead of open lots.

* The music was kinda different.

This is mostly going off of a conversation I had with a guy who was really into the scene back in the early 90's in San Francisco. I can only imagine how crazy and different it might have been, then.
