They can end up living almost exclusively in their imagination, resisting reality with a defensive attitude, feeling like a misfit and spending enormous amounts of time exploring and discovering their deepest hidden fantasies and emotions. In this state, they might be attracted to majorly defective people and environments, which they perceive will truly understand and appreciate them.""

MBTI is a questionnaire designed to measure psychological preferences in how people **perceive the world and make decisions**. That doesn't mean that all people of the same type are the same. It means that the way they perceive the world and process information is similar. 

Your personality **type** is not your personality. An MBTI type is like an empty bowl if you wish and your *personality* is the content of that bowl. Your experiences, good or bad, your opinions, everything that defines you as a person. The bowl shapes the content, but the content is by far more important than the bowl.

So I really, REALLY don't understand when people come here asking for dating advice with an INFJ. We know their general rough characteristics, but is that enough to give advice? No. 

Now, I'm an INFJ through and through, every test I've done so far has typed me as such and I display all of the personality's traits. But nothing on here which had something to do with interests, hobbies, music/book tastes, whatever, has ever spoken to me personally. Why? Because despite being an INFJ, I'm my own person. That doesn't make me unique, there are millions like me out there, but my personality type sure as hell doesn't define my personality. 


Could we please keep this in mind, at least a little bit? I feel that  people are getting a bit misguided with all this MBTI business.

So I'm going to tell all of you (and myself) this advice which I have heard millions of times from people and have ignored every single time. Most likely I'll ignore it in the future as well, but hopefully not.

1. If your friends tell you your SO or potential SO is no good for you/shady/etc., listen to them. You probably won't, but you should.

2. I know you want to save this person and part of you enjoys being the martyr that will ""do anything for love"" but it's bullshit. If you're fighting so hard to keep the relationship/fling going because you just know it could be awesome, you probably shouldn't. People don't suddenly become what you want them to be. If they're not 100% into you, you're wasting your time. Never share their attention with another guy/girl doing everything you can (and putting yourself through hell) thinking that it will show how much you love them and make them choose you. It's not gonna happen, and if it does you'll probably just end up just harboring a shit ton of resentment.

3. Not everyone is a saint on the inside. Maybe some are, but some are just toxic people. They're not worth your time. 

4. INFJs see the world in terms of possibilities. This sucks. If you're in a shitty situation but you're just so in love, you're not in love with who that person is, you're in love with who that person could be.

I've always felt extremely different from my friends/family/peers, especially other people around my age. I need solitude in order to function and I quietly contemplate everything around me. I tend to live inside of my own version of the world around me; forging my own reality in a sense.

I am utilizing my artistic nature by writing a book series. It's taken a long time and dedication to get the ball rolling... 7 years just building up lore, timelines, bloodlines and races. I'm a digital artist and a singer; I get depressed if I don't have music to tune into and most of the songs/bands I like people have never heard of. 

I am a chameleon; capable of becoming anything anyone needs or wants me to be in order to gain a deeper insight into their souls but more often than not I already know what people are thinking or going to say before they speak -- something that I find incredibly frustrating most of the time.

My ability to sum up and understand people as well as I do has become almost a heavy burden, I don't like interacting with new people and find it incredibly difficult to make new friends  or even want to keep ones that I have. I feel as though I see how shallow and vain that most people unfortunately are and it makes me just want to curl up into a ball and be left alone; at the same time I want to help others and inspire them so I wrestle with my own emotions fairly often. I wonder if it's the same for any other INFJs? 

I originally found out I was an INFJ after taking a personality test in my first year of college (abnormal psychology course) and my professor was thrilled because I was the only other INFJ she'd met (she even made me take 2 different tests after the first.) She was someone I connected with. It's been a few years and I was reading a magazine that mentioned personality types so I decided to retake the test and sure enough, still an INFJ. 

Anyway, this is kind of a ramble but... it's nice to see other people who are similar, reading over a lot of the posts I feel like I have found others much like myself and it's a comforting thought in a world where even family feel like strangers and others think your strange for achieving bliss in isolation.",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1cdslo,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1cdslo/i_dislike_reality/,

This might sound dumb or hokey, but I just wanted to say how much I appreciate everything about this subreddit. I've always been painfully shy, felt very alone, and had a hard time communicating my deep thoughts and feelings with others. This has turned me into sort of a jaded person, and also feel scared very often that I will never find people who truly understand me or connect with me. This past year has been especially hard - I've lost my grandfather (who I was very close to), struggled spiritually, broken up with my first and only boyfriend (who I still love), lost my childhood home, been through a lot of family issues, and gotten used and treated poorly by a lot of good friends who I thought I could trust. It's basically been a lot of grief and loss of meaning for me, and it makes me sad to feel so intensely about so much and have no sort of outlet for it and nothing good to hope for. I have no friends who understand what I've gone through, and it's sad to feel like there's nobody who you'll ever be able to trust or be close to again. It's hard when you feel so close to so few people, and then those people are gone from your life in an instant. 

This subreddit gives me hope, though, because it reminds me that there really are people like me out there, and that the possibility of having friends who truly ""get"" me is really just that: a possibility, and not just some far-away dream. It's good to know that despite living in such an extroverted world that feels full of shallow and uncaring people, the truth is that other people who think like me are hiding out there somewhere, and even if it takes me a while to find them, they do truly exist and it's possible for me to build new (better?) relationships someday.

That said, I appreciate knowing you all feel the same about a lot of the stuff I do and have been through the same sort of experiences, and I look forward to befriending people who share the same basic traits that I do. It's a good feeling, and I'm happy to have been reminded that I am not alone in this world.  :')

There are an awful lot of painful and sometimes silly realizations to be made.  The really ridiculous joke on top of our incredible perceptive abilities is that no matter what all we ferret out we know that ultimate knowledge is still going to elude us.  

We've got to interact with our fellow man most of the time but so much of that is in a painfully shallow way.  We can't tell them about our real thoughts or they might be afraid of us or worse, stare at us blankly.  

There's nothing worse than someone staring at you blankly after you've just tried to communicate a multi-layered emotional concept which has hounded you for days.  Our intensity can be frightening so we hide it behind a mask of neutrality.  

We might live interesting lives (often despite our best efforts) because we accept people immediately so long as they don't set off our alarms.  We accept but do not trust.  Trust can take years except between other INFJ's.  Even then, it's slow.  

Words are painfully inadequate.  Language fails us.  We dumb down every concept for those who don't intuit and hide the truth in every sentence.  We obscure what we see in each other and in the world around us under layers of carefully constructed masks.  

Underneath all of that and within the inner world there are infinite planes.  Imagination in an INFJ is a living force.  Our creative capacity borders on divinity.  

Unfortunately that leaves us in a tough spot where telling other people what's going on in our head-meats is concerned.  Thankfully we can tell each other.  I've noticed other INFJ's tend to...simply understand.  I don't know how or why.  It may have something to do with the scaling nature of language.  We generate a small web of words and it suggests a much larger one.

""First, fear not. You are not weird or strange. This is what they tell you because they have not met someone like you. You are unique and there are very few people like you. More times than once I have had people tell me they have never met someone like me. More times than once I brought a room to a standstill with my perception and wisdom. For that is what your insight really is. It is a mechanism that you will use to gain excessive wisdom as time goes by.


Second, don’t be afraid to call the shots as you see them. You are almost always right. Your gut instinct and your intuition are strong. You have the ability to see things others can’t. If most people can see 2 steps into the future you can see 5. You know what people will say or do before they say or do it. You sense others’ emotions and immediately know what they think. Use this to stay ahead of others. Use this to know when you are being conned.


Third, let your values rule you, don’t try to conquer or change them. It will cause you distress. They will also guide you to the place you need to be if you can control your romantic side. Most people adopt the value system of the society they live in. You, however, are born with an internal value system that responds to your situation. It is why you can easily break laws and have no guilt, but suffer extreme guilt when you betray your value system. However, be wary of your romantic side. Your idealism can make you stray from reality and this can lead you to make decisions that are not rational. Understand this is not a perfect world and you will not change that.


Fourth, become a teacher or a psychologist or a career not at a desk where you can help others. You love helping people. Your compassion and empathy results from your ability to know what people think and go through. You have the uncanny ability to switch places with anyone and feel their suffering. In turn, you become angered when the meek, kind, and honest are defeated. This will cause you to go war, when most of the time your strong negotiating skills bring peace. Learn to control this side. Use your spiritual side to balance the rage and know that these suffering people are just fulfilling their karma. But still help them. You will find failure and no satisfaction in a corporate career. Status means little to you, it is your value system you need. Your keen perception tells you that status stems from the insecurity people have about themselves and how they need to prove themselves to others. As such, you rid yourself of this foolish desire for status and because you answer to no one but your value system. You want the experience, the truth, the realism. What others think of you starts to mean little as you grow older.


Fifth, when dating, try to find someone as strong as or stronger than you. Someone extroverted who can ease you in to a situation, but someone you can trust. Someone who also has the ability to make money. This is important to you although you may not know it yet. You are attracted to this not for materialistic concerns but because it shows they can stand on their own two feet and are strong people. In addition, they will be able to counter your strong personality and bring harmony, which is what brings you pleasure. You will back down to them in an admiringly way. For men, you are likely to be impressed by a female executive, a college professor, someone that helps the down trodden in her spare time. One who can engage in deep conversation because your knowledge on issues is vast.
Few people understand the power of your mind, insight, compassion, and loyalty. Women will be impressed by your emotionality when they get through to you. They will enjoy how you avoid machismo for deeper conversation and they will be delighted to experience the full range of emotions you can provide. Likely, you will talk to your significant other about the beauty of Paris as the men in the next room rally behind the local football game. They will be stunned at your sincerity and honesty. And it takes time for them to get inside you. When they do, and you let them in, these people are guarded for life. They will have access to some of the deepest and most stimulating conversations of their lives, climaxing in love-making. The void of their own insecurity will be filled with you and your ability to understand them. And make sure to let them in. Don’t block for too long, this will drive them away. To do this say what you are thinking. You have the ability to disappear in thought. Bring that thought o the front and speak it.


Lastly, in terms of spirituality, you probably know by now organized religion does little for you. But deep down you sense there is something else going on. Pursue this. Don’t fear this; your intuition will protect you from con men and hacks. But you will be surprised to know that you do in fact have a spiritual side. Just build your own path.""",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1fa76n,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1fa76n/you_are_special/,

He was scurrying about. He'd run one way, stop, and then turn around and run the other. This ant got me thinking about a lot.

Here we are. Two living things, seemingly completely different, both alive at the same time. Breathing the same air, in the same space. 

The ant sees his world much differently than I do. He probably doesn't even know I exist. The giant object that blocks his path isn't the hand of a human to him, it's merely an obstacle that he has to find a way around. He doesn't realize that the desk he is crawling on has a completely different meaning and purpose to another living being that is observing him. 

However the more I watched and thought about this ant, the more I found that I had in common with him.

He's just trying to help. Trying to do his part to contribute to the bigger picture of the survival of his colony. He was probably out looking for food to bring back to the other ants. But he's gotten a little lost along the way. Perhaps he's been searching tirelessly for hours upon hours before he happened upon my desk. 

He may never find the little crumb he is looking for, yet he keeps looking. He isn't giving up. He'll take a few seconds, rest and clean his antennae, and then continue on his quest. 

For now he is all alone. Separated from the other ants. Maybe it's them he's looking for, and not the crumb. Maybe he has completely forgotten what he has been looking for the whole time. Maybe he's looking for something to look for.

Either way, he'll keep crawling. As fast as he can. Avoiding obstacles and reacting to his environment. 

He'll keep crawling.

My weekly gaming night has been bogged down **quite** badly by one of our players who decided to bring his S.O. along and have her join in the game when we lost our fourth player to college in another state.

She talks about her personal life, which is a bucket of crazy, talks on her cell phone while we're playing, brags about her twelve-year-old who I know from personal experience is a MASSIVE twit, and the worst of it...I guess the best way to say it is she 'leaks' emotion at every seam.  I loathe playing with her.  Even being in her presence starts to make me ill after a little while.  

It might be alright if she were anything like decent but she's genuinely awful at the game.  

I discussed with the other players wanting her out but they're both INTJs; very sweet but they have the empathy of a sponge cake.  They don't get the emotional leakage thing.

So, after a long week of work, viciously over-socialized, and exhausted I went to our Monday gaming night hoping to relax.  She came in and the first thing she did was go off on how wonderful her child is.  He beat Borderlands 2 after only two weeks and he's fighting with her batshit crazy, pregnant room-mate again!

I did my best to sit quietly but couldn't stop myself from face-palming.  She asked what was wrong and what I meant to say was 'Oh, nothing.  It's fine.'

What I actually said was 'When you talk about your child, you make me want to kill myself.'  

As you can imagine, gaming ended shortly after that.  She sat in a corner and sulked until her boyfriend went to comfort her.  I unplugged my machine and left without another word.  

I'm an INFJ.  That means, in general, I prefer to be kind when I can.  I've lost it with people only on a hand-full of occasions and when I do, it's usually only for one sentence but when that sentence comes out it's a knife-blade.  It hits them right where it hurts.

I don't tend to be particularly expressive of this to the person, as I don't like to feel clingy or over-attached because I feel like it will alienate people.  

However, because I feel I care too deeply, I worry that this is apparent to other people and on some level makes them uncomfortable, and so they simply tolerate my presnce when I am present as opposed to genuinely enjoying the person that I am.  That I have social anxiety problems tends to compound this feeling for me.

1349283545.0,41,self.infj,10vt32,"I am an INTJ male, but INFJ's are my absolute favorite type of person and I love them. Am I the only one? ",Ridiculously_INTJ,42,1,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/10vt32/i_am_an_intj_male_but_infjs_are_my_absolute/,"INTJ male, hard science major. Everyone tells me that I never show any emotion in real life, but: 

It's hard to pin down exactly. I've taken the tests, gotten INTJ, read all the articles about how amazing and hyper-efficient I am. Then you dive into the flaws, and I realize that as an INTJ I'm also egotistical and walled-off in communication. I don't like most of the other INTJ's that I meet, but I have loved every INFJ that I've ever met. 

INFJ's seem to me to be very thoughtful and deep people, but never problematic. They can solve problems, but they rarely ever actually create the problem, whereas INTJ's can only solve rational problems and then go on to create a slew of emotional dilemmas. They may not care, but not everyone is an INTJ and the problems still exist. INFJ's are aided in intuition, they can solve rational problems in addition to emotional ones. 

The first girl I ever met that was INFJ, I immediately developed a huge crush on her. Except naturally as an INTJ, I never showed an ounce of interest. Having feelings for a person means that I have to run away and show them less attention than I do everyone else. She was an intellectual, capable of succeeding in anything she set her mind to, but where she really shined was art history and literature. She had a natural sense for fostering a comfortable environment of kindness and good nature. If anyone set out to offend her, she just smiled and withdrew, never communicating with them again and not furthering the hostility. While she was a deeply empathetic person, she never turned away from things or people that she found unsettling and cruel. She just took an effort to understand why that was, and attempted to fix anything that she saw. Horrible assholes were not just evil people to be avoided to her. They were individuals, each with their own set of personal pain and stories. I found the ability to understand this an extremely attractive quality. 

Every INFJ I've ever met seemed to possess the analytical skills of a scientist with the deep empathy and emotional understanding of a poet. Some of this may be a huge generalization; I am aware that not all personalities are exactly the same, and there are horrible INFJ's out there somewhere. It's just that I've never found one yet. 

Anyway, I can't really be the only one. While it's not a thought that I've never really shared with anyone: one of the best things in life as an INTJ male for me is the act of forming a genuinely meaningful and important emotional bond with someone. I rarely ever meet people that I actually want to bond with emotionally, but when I do, I aim to stay in their lives for as long as possible. Most people are too fickle and shallow for me to want to get close to, but the stereotypical INFJ personality brings out a sentimental side in me that hardly anyone ever sees.

I don't know why I'm not using a throwaway. I could get into really really solid details about the entire thing (it would take a really long time though, but there's an extremely large amount of layers to it and it would most likely help you understand the terrifying depths of my heartbreak) and I would probably be met with people that would truly understand how damaged my capacity to trust has become after this or people who would eviscerate me choosing this relationship in the first place.

3 years ago, the love of my live, a girl who I knew since diapers, someone who I had spent 3 years idealizing and visualizing this sweet married future with someone who I thought was so caring and most importantly someone who got me, cared for me, was patient with me and dearly loved me back, broke up with me 10 days before our wedding, and the day after we bought our wedding rings together. 2.5 years later I found out she was most likely cheating on me with the person she would ultimately marry less than a year after they broke up. Last Dec someone who would know said they had their first child. My whole life I've idealized humans, how we should act, how much integrity we should bring to the table when being there for someone in need. I care for people, it really hurts when I see people in pain, yet I've been in need of love and support my whole life, and all I've gotten was pain back. People are callous towards me. They don't understand me. They think I'm weird. They think the amount of things I think about simultaneously is disturbing. I think I'm like The Wolf from Pulp Fiction. ""I think fast. I Talk fast. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fucking car"" I've always idealized love. I could never do casual relationships even though sometimes my sexual energy makes me want to grab certain prospects and fuck the living shit out of them like a rabid mad dog who just escaped the loony bin. I value love and the type of care, integrity, and trust a significant other I believe should bring to the table. I idealize the island of safety and trust that other person is **supposed** to be for people. I always wanted to be the greatest father in the world, the exact opposite of my callous, harsh, and bully-like dad who because he couldn't understand me, resented the shit out me. Especially when I had the balls to tell him how fucked up of a person he really is, and that he has no business telling me how I'm supposed to live my life ( he hated my ex-fiance and her entire family, and it drove a gigantic rift in the relationship that never got repaired, and in her parting words, she said she loved me to death and wanted me to find nothing but happiness, but she could not be with me because she believed my parents mistreated her; the night before we bought our rings and she never answered another text or call from me again, she kissed my hand, looked up into the sky, and thanked God for putting such a caring and sweet person into her life, the exact opposite of her asshole first husband, then after that, one of the single happiest moments of my life up until that point, she leaves me out in the cold, abandoning a person who for so long had just couldn't understand how cold and callous people can be towards each other, but thought he finally found someone who was just like him, a loyal dog, with limitless unconditional love to give out, and enough patience, care, and understanding to match. He apparently was dead wrong about that)

I'm really sorry for this sudden emesis of words. Someone close to me has really hurt me today. I'm 29 right now, my relationship with my ex ended in 2010. I have been devastated ever since. Really fucked, I'm not going to lie. After she left I couldn't talk to anyone, I could not believe how the person whose tears I wiped away so many times, the person I tried so hard to be the best guy for, spent 3 years changing my life for so the family I wanted to have so quickly with her, so I could just wake up next to that beautiful face and kind person and just hug the shit out of and say to hell with work today I'm sleeping in, I could not believe that person just left me high and dry like that. I always just wanted to find one awesome person, marry her, and just start out great idealized life. I know I'm good. I'm cooperative, sweet, fun, understanding, hell we're all INFJs here you understand, we will fight to the fucking death having your back. But why the fuck is it SO HARD to find someone to be with who is EXACTLY like that. Do people not get or forget how to be a loyal partner anymore and good person? I can't even begin to describe the depths of my efforts for this person. One year at college it was her birthday but the end of the semester so I had no money. I was stressing about finals but I was stressing out about the fact that I couldn't do anything for her on her special day, to show her how much I care, to show her partner would part the seas to just make her feel truly and genuinely appreciated, so that she knows come the apocalypse, at least she'll still have me watching out for her. I in a moment of brilliant resourcefulness, came up with a plan that would net me a quick 400 bucks (I bought a ps3 with one additional controller and 3 games, a 600 dollar bundle with my circuit city credit card, and I hustled it for 400 all over my school campus the entire day until finally at night I had a buyer who came to my house even though was was skeptical about who in their right might would just spend money on a 600 dollar bundle and sell it right away for 400. He asked me right before he put down the 400 and walked away with his merchandis, ""this all looks legit but WHY would you do this bro? I said I needed quick cash for my fiances birthday and I wanted her to have a special night and be with her on that night."" He told me I really loved that girl and I replied back that I really do, ""you have no idea"") to come to downstate NY where both of us lived, go to her place, pick her up and take her to a nice restaurant in our favorite village by the water (where we spent our 1st blissfully amazing date together 3 years earlier) and bought her a nice little present, I don't remember exactly what it was specifically from the many gifts I had given her in our 3 year relationship. I do remember however that I even paid the band in the restaurant that night, a fucking awesomely talented jazz band with a kick ass talented female lead, to sing a song her her birthday while we danced and they gave her a birthday shout out. I proposed to her on a bended knee in front of a crowded Manhattan restaurant full of people, the truly upscale class of people even in Manhatten this restaurant was NICE, and they all stopped when I proposed and focused their sea of eyeballs on my back as I looked up to her for her answer. When she said yes I had a crowd of people cheering for us hooting and hollering, it was amazing, I felt amazing. I would have done anything for this girl. 

I'm sorry if this goes in 30,000 different directions because it still hurts just thinking about the level of betrayal, one that I thought I would never have to endure from anyone, but especially not from a particular person whom I made myself so vulnerable to because I CARED so much for, not from a person who could so thoroughly eviscerate my heart. I've wanted to make a throwaway and just tell the whole story on reddit so many times, but always told myself it's not neccessary because I was over it or it was too painful to even think about. I guess the reason I'm doing it here is because spending the little time I have on this subreddit, I can truly see how uncannily similar to each other we all are. There's no denying it. So my reasoning for this post was maybe to vent a little, but also gauge whether anyone here could truly understand the depths of my heartbreak, let down, and disappointment with this person and explain to me why it's been so hard to get over this, how I was able to literally sleep in my car for a month after it happened and dropped everything important in my life, including a medical college I was attending and a job, and just withdraw from everyone and do nothing but just smoke weed and cry on the inside. I want to say I will find someone again who could be like her only the person I wish she had been. I just want to find someone who truly makes me feel that level of energy and motivation I did at the time. I felt so invincible. I feel so empty now. I need a powerful soul to help me pick up the ashes of mine, one that once stood so tall, but one who now feels so pessimistic about love, people, and relationships. I know they're are good people out there, including great girls, but I don't know if I could ever love someone truly as much and am even more fearful that I will never find someone who could match the capacity of love, caring, and affection I could give out. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm very deeply scarred. That hurt comes and goes, but like I said I've known her and her family since diapers, I think the pain will subside even more as time goes by, but it will always be there...Anyway, I'm done, this was hard, and doesn't even scratch the surface of what a wild ride the whole thing had been. I could literally write a novel, I shit you not, and it would be incredible and heartbreak. Like I said, many, many layers. I'll leave you with a picture of us in our happier times though, hopefully you could get a sense of how much I actually loved her...like it even matters anymore, but hey, here it is:  http://i.imgur.com/ImImTuc.jpg


Btw, I had a couple of other small, short term relationships (short term = less than a month) after this, to get over the heartbreak and see if I could love like that again. It didn't, and I couldn't. Not with these people at least. My ex was truly special to me. I loved everything about her. It just shocked me to find out what kind of person she turned out to be. It was a true, true mind fuck. After all this time, that's the best way to describe it all. I thought was had such a real connection, I was convinced. I guess I was too stupid, or naive. Maybe both. 



**Edit** - Thank you all so much for the kind words. I think what compelled me here to give you all a small snippet of the story was the fact that obviously a lot of us think and care about other people in many of the same ways. People surrounding me could never understand how I could love her so much or could understand how loyal and committed to her I was, they weren't very understanding or empathetic to my heartbreak and I never really had anyone to talk to who actually cared about how immense of a loss this all was to me. I never thought I would get over it. Maybe I loved her too much. Maybe sometimes people just get lucky and find someone that loves them dearly, and they shouldn't question it, but just go with it. I'm pretty confident I would have always loved her as much, so she had nothing to worry about in terms of me changing my love for her because she is all not all that great. I had fought for this girl after countless hours of analyzing whether or not it was worth it for me, and after I determined it was, I just fought for her. That's it. What bothers me most though is that she had always felt I didn't fight enough, and was especially upset sometimes about how I didn't stand up to my parents for her. I was kicked out of my house a few times during our relationship because I was so upset my parents made her feel so uncomfortable, that it was killing my relationship. In the end I realized it was her, she was causing all these minor little issues maybe because she wanted to maintain a reason to break it off eventually or maybe towards the end she was actually cheating. I do know that her sister made FB group announcing our wedding and that one of the people that had commented and left a message that was something along the lines of ""I'm so happy for you guys, congratulations. I hope you two have a very happy life together"" was actually the person that ended up marrying her. So yeah, that's pretty fucked up and makes me want to throw some things, but whatever. I'm trying to move on, but that heartache is always there under the surface. Right now I'm working full time again and am just trying to save up money so I can complete a couple of classes that will allow me to work a second job at the hospital. I want to save up all that money so I can find a place of my own, enroll back into medical classes and slowly but surely enroll in a good PA program and finish that. That's what my ultimate goal was when we were together. I want to finish it because it will allow me to have the family I always wanted, and also, not going to lie and say this isn't a part of the motivation, but maybe she thought I would never end up completing the program. She ended up marrying a dentist who she met at her medical college, I could at least finish, enjoy a career I think I was made for, and help people in need, all the while showing her that had she just kept her faith in everything, her and I would have ended up being ok. But maybe she doesn't care at all at this point. She's probably living her happy life out, completely oblivious to my ongoing heartbreak. No matter though, I will move on and I feel I do and will find someone special that actually deserves the love I'm capable of giving out. I will just be a little more careful this time about the way I give it out and who I give it to. Thanks again for the support everyone, you guys are really awesome for listening and trying to console me, I can't tell you how much I appreciate that. I hope everyone has a good day and spends it with someone really special, or I hope you find someone really special. I know how awesome it feels as INFJ to have a partner in crime...  ;-)

**Edit 2** - I am going to reply to each one of you beautiful people. It's hard to consecutively though. The way that some of our painful experience mirror each other is honestly a little overwhelming for me. It brings back that kick in the gut feeling I once felt so consistently afterwards. I WILL however take the personal time to thank each and every one of you for the support and personal stories you have shared, they really do make me feel stronger that there are some actually really kind and understanding souls in this world who actually ""get it""..if that makes sense..",,False,,t5_2r39a,1367281302.0,,,True,t3_1dauop,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1dauop/3_years_ago/,

1372982218.0,38,self.infj,1hnvu1,I used to think that I'm a little bit crazy (and that I was the only one)...,skyfly3r,46,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1hnvu1/i_used_to_think_that_im_a_little_bit_crazy_and/,"...until I just learned about different personality types, took the test, and figured out that I am an INFJ.

My entire life I felt... weird... and out of place... I found it very difficult to connect with people around me. My ideas and my thought process were always more complex and deep than those of my peers. The few friends that I've had in my life were always either 3-5 years younger than me or 10-50 years older than me. No matter who they were, they were always surprised by the insight I have on life. I was always called ""too mature"" for my age (no matter how young or old I was). 

By the time I got to college, I was certain of a few things about me. I was okay with big groups and had no problem socializing, but I preferred one-on-one connections where I found opportunities for deeper talks. Anything less than ""deep"" connections was unsatisfying to me. Leadership was common sense to me. Although I preferred one-on-one, I had no problem of getting up in front of a hundred people and giving a speech on the subject of interest, and people would actually listen. I recognized people's emotions and I could easily see sadness and pain around me. I also felt an inner desire to do something about people's suffering. The way I processed situations around me was also fundamentally different from others' processes. I always saw something ""bigger"" and ""deeper"" in every situation. I relentlessly looked for ""hidden meaning"" in just about everything. I never talked to anyone about me and who I was inside. I fully realized that I had never met anyone else like me before. I also knew that if I were ever to say that to anyone else, I'd sound like the most egoistical, full-of-herself, cliched person. I never wanted that. So I kept it all to myself. 

There were other self-realizations, but those were my core: I knew I was a masked introvert, very intuitive, and self-guided by strong sense of empathy towards others. **And I felt so alone because of that.** I felt like no one else around me was fighting the fight I was fighting. No one else saw what I saw. All of that pain. And suffering. Nobody else even *cared* about the depth of life and connections that we can have as humans. I've come to terms with who I was. But it was so damn lonely here in my head.

When I did that test, it finally made sense why. Not to sound too ignorant of other types, but it does seem like it's crazy difficult to be INFJs. **We are the one percent**, so to speak. 

So if you're like me, you've felt alone a fair share in your life. **Don't. Because you're not. You're not alone.** There are others just like you. We see things the way you do. We feel things the way you do. And we have the power to change this world. It may seem that if others truly saw your heart and mind, they'd see too much. They'd see just how much you care. Just how beautifully complex you are. That's why you never show yourself. That's why you hide. And, in your shelter, you seem to be alone. But you are not alone. You are not alone.

That's what I realized upon taking that test and coming to this subreddit. There are others who can understand me and the complexity in my head.

I'm a very lucky person. I was gifted great genes that have made me a pretty attractive guy.
I have countless opportunities to pursue women and if I desired could probably have a lot of sex. All my friends think I get laid all the time and are shocked when I tell them I choose not to.

 I'm not like my friends, who just want to get laid, and have a one night stand. I don't want to meet a girl, have sex with her and then say goodbye forever. I can't help but feel guilty, feeling that I used her, so I don't. I have to get to know her, otherwise it's empty for me, meaningless and hollow. 

I can charm and flirt with the best but if you slip me your number I probably won't call. Intimacy is something that I crave but becomes desecrated if I don't know her inside and out.

I guess what I'm saying is, I yearn for a meaningful relationship as most of us on here do. Yet are all of you just as indifferent when it comes to one night stands?

Do you have to truly be connected to someone to feel anything?

are all you out there picking up partners left and right? Or do you go for long relationship to relationship?

I've always enjoyed acting silly and making people laugh and, for someone who isn't planning on going into comedy, I put alot of work into it... Also, small talk, conversations about sports and the weather, that doesn't interest me at all and when I force myself to act like it does, it's SO tiring. I usually just stick to the silly smart ass persona because nobody once talk about my interests. Nobody wants to talk about the history of Post Hardcore(even if they listen to it), or how brilliant of a tactician Frederick the Great was, or how Kubrick revolutionized filmmaking, or what a good replacement for Capitalism might be, or if there is a purpose to all of this. My interests are pretty boring to most people. I'm the kind of person who makes a baby rape joke and uses it as an excuse to tell people that there is an actual horrifying problem in South Africa where there have been numerous cases of baby rape. I really enjoy being this person. I've always enjoyed making people laugh, I just wish others wanted to discuss the works of Hemingway or theology with me. It takes alot of energy out of me too. As much as I enjoy it though, I can't tell if this is really me or not, or if I'm just playing a role I really like.


Then there's the other persona I take on. My dad and I are really different. We have different views on philosophy, different outlooks on life, and different senses of humor. Whenever I'm around him I just sorta shut down. I become an extremely boring, do-nothing person. We hardly speak because of the way he reacts when I tell him things. One time, we were discussing drugs and I told him I don't think any drugs should be illegal and he got really mad at me. It turned into this big argument, not because I was doing drugs but because I had an opinion. I can;t joke around with him. We have very conflicting views.I have no idea what to do there. I'm not the extroverted jokester but I'm not myself either...although maybe the jokester person is who I am. My dad is hardly aware I have a sense of humor. That dates all the way back to late elementary school and early midle school, when I made a joke about a possessed cat or lighting something on fire. Looking back on it, I think he was more concerned about the fact I told it in school and he didn't want me to get in trouble but he was still appalled at the comment. He doesn't get absurdist jokes or self deprecation either. I'm not very comfortable with the way we rarely communicate. We spend time together but conversations aren't to common, meaningful ones even rarer. The person that I act like for my father is who that entire side of the family thinks I am...and I don't like that but I don't know how to, or whether I even should, change it.


To put things in perspective, I'm only 16, so maybe these are all just teenage problems (and it also explains the immature sense of humor). Do any of you struggle with these kind of problems? Do you become a different person for different people? Can you give me any advice?

My brain runs and runs and runs. That's about all there is to it, actually. I feel the universe, but only because I feel my insides so much, I pop out on the other side, empty and full of oblivion, infinite in size. And I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that this cosmic insanity that we are all a part of is so epic in size that it makes everything we do much more important. 

It doesn't make sense, and yet it does. 

I can see someone on the street, and feel tears come to my eyes at his sadness that drips from every nondescript feature that I see. I feel it. It's palpable, and it's weird that not many other people can just *tell* when someone is down. 

At parties, I seek out a one-to-one conversation, manically hoping that someone needs fixing or needs advice. Yearning for someone who *deserves* help. 

My wife, a devout ISTJ, is one of the few people I just don't get. I swear to God she has a secret power plug that she uses when she recharges her robot-battery. But it's okay; I feel enough emotion for both of us. 

I'm amazed at the amount of beauty in this world, both from landscapes and from us humans. I tend to ignore the bad; waiting for it to atrophy, a disgusted troll heading off to bed with no food. 

And yet, my thoughts grow dark and cloudy every once in a while. I can't watch an octopus cook on a grill, but I can vividly picture chaos and destruction on countless levels. A secret part of me hates that bad guys in movies are all ""troubled youths"" who were merely reacting to their upbringing. 

Some people are just bad.

I don't ever talk about myself, my *real* self, so thanks for letting me get this off my chest.

These are a series of questions that you're supposed to ask yourself when you start internally freaking out about something. 
Like assuming (for no good reason) that someone doesn't like you, or thinking you're not reaching the high standards you set for yourself, or how you will never be able to end the suffering of millions around the World ...

It's not specifically designed for INFJ's but I think there are some great questions that are completely relevant to some of us...

So hopefully someone finds this useful:


- Is the way I'm thinking helpful?

- Am I being too hard on myself?

- Am I expecting myself to be perfect?

- Am I using double standards?

- Am I jumping to conclusions?

- Am I asking questions that have no answers?

- Is there a better alternative thought?

- Am I confusing thought with fact?

- Am I getting things out of proportion?

- Am I making things out to be worse than they are?

- What is the worst that can REALLY happen?

- Am I concentrating on me weaknesses and forgetting my strengths?

- What are the advantages and disadvantages of thinking this way?

- Am I exagerating?

And now I am finally home, in my sanctuary, free to spend much needed time away from everyone. And I feel fucking horrible. I feel empty in a way I shouldn't. I don't know what to do with myself. 

I longed to get home. I longed to play my guitar. I wanted to listen to music, to be content. I expected to just feel satisfied with my day. 

Is this how it's supposed to be? I can't even be happy with trying my best to be extroverted? That I shouldn't be able to say what's on my mind during the day? Because if I do, I will feel utterly drained of all emotion to the point that the only thing left to feel at the end of the day is bleak, black fucking misery. 

Is this even something that you can relate to, my dear, suffering constellation of souls across the globe?

Thank you for your answers. Since you seem to focus a lot around on what I did yesterday, I'll explain a bit further. I went to volunteer as a roadie at a show, by myself. I do this to get experience and to meet people. Sound engineering is a tough business and you need to know your shit if you want to work anywhere. My dream is to become a musician, and working toward a real job and my dream at the same time is a good plan. Since none of my friends are interested, I always go alone. Most people in the business are musicians as well, so it's easy to fit in. But yeah, it's a full day 10-23, with a bunch of new people. 

All of your answers have a different silver lining. I can't generically answer them here, so I'll just delve into the thread. 

**Edit 2**

I am going through a period of change at the moment. A lot of old friends are disappearing and a lot of new experiences are forced upon me. I also seek out a lot of new experiences on own initiative after pondering over goals and meaning. I strike these low points after a lot of these. The post is kind of vague but at the same time it's a true depiction of what goes on in my mind after being more social/less scornful/more humble/down to earth than I'm used to.

And this whole thing about being a dominant male.  It's just not me.  I have no idea what it means to be a man.  There's a great scene in The Master where Joaquin Phoenix character gets mad at this one guy and he explodes: ""do something! say something! be a man!""  I just feel completely lost about being a typical male.

Anyways I guess I kind of got off topic but there is my rant.  I feel lost as an INFJ male and don't really have anyone to talk to.


Edit: I guess it also doesn't help that I wear skinny jeans and often get confused for being a gay man. I fall into more of the alternative/hipste crowd or whatever the hell you want to call it.

I especially notice this when I look at the manner in which INFs handle their values and morals. If there's something I'm missing here, feel free to correct me.

It appears that there is a very large amount of self-described INFJs who exhibit Fi traits. They hold their own uniqueness, integrity and morals to an incredibly high standard. They do things based upon what THEY feel. They are incredibly concerned with what is internally right or wrong. They are individualistic, more self-centered than people-centered.

This is not Fe. Fe is diplomatic. It is people-centered and considers others before the self, even when going about day-to-day, regular activities. It asks how it can play a role within the community, rather than standing out from it. It reaches out to people and seeks to form connections and relationships. It is also willing to conform to social norms in order to reach this goal. *In some cases, it will even bend internal/personal rules for someone else.*

So, I see that a lot of self-typed INFJs put more emphasis on HOW SOMETHING MAKES THEM FEEL than anything else. I'm not saying INFJs don't have emotions! It's just that their dominant function is *not* a moral compass. I think there are a lot of INFPs who believe to be INFJ, but they're mistaking Ni for Fi. They have a certain belief, a value - and when they see the world through the lenses of that value, they believe they're using Ni when they take in data and mold it to fit into their belief system. While it's possible that Ni could be used in such a manner, I believe this is more indicative of Fi behavior, and Ni is not concerned with the moral implications of an interpretation. It is the foreseeing function - the ""gut feeling"" evaluation of the deeper meaning behind something, or how something will be. The problem is that symbolic, beneath-the-surface analysis can be meshed with emotional judgment and morals, and so it's difficult to know whether your perception *stems* from feelings.

I notice that many self-typed INFJs also struggle with being social and don't know how to open themselves up or form connections with others. Now...this *could* be due to high Ni and its nature of needing to think for a long time before coming out with a statement. However, because Fe should also be strong in an INFJ, they should therefore be able to open up on a certain level, using Ni to sense what the other is thinking and combining it with Fe to effectively form a connection. This isn't to say that INFJs should be extraverts; they still need to be alone to recharge, and mostly live in their own inner world of perception.

I answered over three hundred of the available questions, just to see if I could get the most accurate results possible.

The people I'm most attracted to are intelligent, sexually open, socially aware, friendly, good critical thinkers, and generally very liberal minded.  I value authenticity in people and the group the 'match %' setting brought were largely *that*.  Very impressive.  Most match-making sites are pretty shit but this one seemed to work!

Now, after a couple days I got a bit bored and decided to turn things around.  I set the system to bring me those with the highest 'enemy' percentage.   

Whooo boy.  

It turns out the opposite of a healthy INFJ is the cast of Jersey Shore.  

There's no other way to put it.  Of my top ten enemies, six of them had Oompa Loompa spray on tans and tattoos on their faces.  I had three girls making 'duckface' in their pictures, two lingerie shots, and one guy whose pictures included one of him holding a shotgun with two twenty dollar bills stuffed in the barrels.  

There were pictures of girls with their ex-boyfriends.  Some of the girls had death threats IN their dating profiles.  

""If you cheat on me, I'll cut you!""

... except it was usually written as 'if u cheat i cut u!!!111!'.  

Several of the guys had pictures of themselves doing keg-stands.  Most of the women were single parents who got pregnant sometime in their early teens.  

What was really amazing to me, though, were the incredible inconsistencies of thought.  INFJs like consistency.  One spectacular case was listed as 100% my enemy.  She worked four jobs, has a child, is extremely serious about her religion (she used the word God no less than seven times in her profile) and claimed she's 'a very relaxed person who likes to chill out'.

I personally tend to do this to people for one of three reasons. One, they are being too needy and I need to assert my independence. Two, as a way to punish them for doing something I have a moral opposition to. Three, for very directly insulting me, even if they apologize sincerely. The latter usually results in much longer term silence, or just a generally cold disposition towards that person. 

Do any of you do similar things to 'punish' people?

When the generator gives you a number, you look at the chart (there are some instructions provided on the image itself) and answer the question linked to the number, i suggest writing it by hand or typing it in a word document, if you do a few of these it's nice to be able to return to them at a later time and review your standings about certain things at certain times.  (if you like, you can simply answer all of the questions provided, I just found this to be more fun)

I'm 23 , and I found that three or four years of my life I've been going through a lot of personal development. I discovered I was an INFJ around six months ago (Previously I thought I was INTJ, due to the emotional wall I put up through childhood.

The idea is these points are a guide on how I want to live my life. Not The Guide, not The Way, not The Religion; simply a guide. Still, I stick to them as strictly as I can.

* Never lie to others. Always be honest.

* Understanding is key in life. Be open about your concerns and problems. Even if you don't agree with one another, it is better to know where someone stands.

* Knowing and accepting your flaws makes you perfect.

* Be kind to others. We are all human and thus we all feel the pain others can inflict.

* You may be loyal, but do not be blind. The quest for understanding requires you know all sides and opinions. Then choose for yourself.

* Always seek to do the greatest good.

* You are defined by your actions; stay true to yourself and display it through what you do.

* Emotions are human’s greatest strength and greatest weakness. Always be mindful of yours. Ask yourself if what you feel is justified.

* Life is irreplaceable. If it is taken it can never be returned. Such choices should be made with the greatest of care.

* Remember that property is fleeting. Do not put material possessions above others.

* Help others whenever possible. People remember good deeds.

* Seek to improve yourself, in any way you feel is valuable.

* Always chose truth and knowledge over ignorance. Though accepting it may be hard, it is always the better choice.

* Be humble. Everyone around you should be treated as an equal.

I'm not afraid of occasional confrontation, but I absolutely can't tolerate it when I can't get on terms of mutual respect with someone. 

My downstairs neighbors are a very cool, very bohemian (slightly) older couple who act like they think I'm a piece of shit. We make an effort to be respectful, but perhaps we make noise upstairs--and perhaps there have been other offenses that I'm not aware of--yet never once have they confronted me about anything. Any of my earlier attempts at communication have lead to immediate dismissal. They seem content treat me like a son of a bitch and completely ignore me when they're sitting on their porch and I'm walking by. They don't even look in my direction, like I don't exist. With ninety five percent of people, I can win over with kindness, but not them. Attempting to be nice just gives them more opportunity to contemptuously dismiss me. 

My first inclination is to be like, whatever, fuck them and shame on them. They are the ones that clearly have difficulty handling situations in an adult manner and are projecting so much unwarranted hate onto me. But getting angry at them just makes my day a little shittier. On the other hand, their constant shittiness always upsets or hurts me, and I'm someone who's generally good about not caring about bs. I realize it might have a lot to do with envy because they're poor hipsters and I seem to have a decent car and a fancy yuppie job, but I can't seem to put myself in their head space and understand why they're such dicks to me. 

I realize all I can really do is be as neutral as possible and not let it get to me. But I'm sick of constantly playing the ""who cares less"" game when I pass by. It bothers me that they won't at least acknowledge me, even though I suppose they owe me nothing.

Do any of you feel this way?,heavyheartwolf,29,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1cmkf4/i_feel_like_my_need_for_meaning_is_alienating_do/,"Over the past year I've be recovering from a depressive episode. An important piece of healing from my depression has been socializing with people and developing my social skills. While I think I've made a lot of improvement, I've been having trouble staying true to myself while trying to expand my social circle and become more open. I wouldn't call it an obsession, but I have a fundamental interest in the humanities (Philosophy, Literature, Art, History, Politics, Language) that a lot of people don't share. I'm drawn to the humanities because, like many of you, I have a need to try to find meaning. It's the study of being human and, because of that, I've read a lot. Unfortunately, the wealth of knowledge makes me feel alienated from others who aren't interested in finding meaning. 

 I don't mean to say that that's all I have to talk about, but there doesn't seem to be many people who have much interest in these things. It's not that I'm dying to have conversations about these things either, it's that I have to censor myself and not let my knowledge about these things cause social friction. For instance, when people ask me if I'm reading something or what I'm reading, I usually don't answer with an in depth description because they probably don't want to hear it. I don't like people knowing that I read philosophy, poetry or foreign literature, because most people don't read those things and can't relate. How am I supposed to answer what my favorite film is when my real answer is it's an existential Russian film that can't be summed up in a sentence? I've found myself really skirting around these kind of questions and straight up lying by giving generic answers. Even when I have something to say in conversations about politics or history (which I never start now) I usually keep it to myself because whatever I have to say often shuts down or hijacks the conversation. Another example, some friends were having a conversation about how great they thought the idea of communism is, but they were pretty new to the whole idea. Throughout the whole conversation I wanted to give my researched opinion that contradicted theirs and would have derailed the whole conversation. 

I have this whole other side to me that isn't appropriate to share. I can't share my interests because they won't be accepted or engaged. It's almost like living two lives at once. I like socializing with people, I like to talk about what's happening in the day to day, have drinks, go to parties and have a good time, but I feel like a whole side of me is never engaged. I've tried breaching these deeper conversations with people who'd seem interested, but I haven't had a lot of success so I've become more reserved with what I talk about. I know that I can't justs drop philosophical tidbits into conversation and expect people to engage them, so I have to censor myself, but it's causing issues.

I'm a straight male, 20, if you were wondering. 


Firstly, i'd like to state i'm somewhat of a hopeless romantic. I like to fantasise about the ideal love, and this hope (delusion?) actively affects my choices when deciding on who to, excuse the archaism, court. I only want girls who I think I may be able to love. As a result, finding someone who I am attracted to in more than a carnal way is very rare. I only really contend the idea of one night stands when i'm horny, and I've never had a real one. Many people criticise my ideas of love and romanticism, and although it takes a huge toll on my sex life, I still grasp onto this ideal. So, my kindred spirits, has this account struck a note with you, or am I strange?


Tl;dr: Fellow INFJs, one night stands and free love, or meaningful relationships and romanticism?

DAE have an extremely visual-based memory? I know I don't have a photographic memory, but I'm relatively sure it's some form of extremely visual memory. I've always known myself to be a visual learner from very early on in life (interesting since I'm a musician and writer, but not a visual artist). But in the last several years (I'm 18 now) I've noticed this becoming stronger and more apparent. (Which is strange since at 16 I got glasses and contacts for my horrid eyesight, which deteriorated pretty quickly it seems, it was good when I was younger). I often do not take notes during my classes because I find myself linking the ideas of the lesson to what's being written on the board, or projected on the screen. Often times, I feel very distracted if I try to take notes, especially if the instructor writes on a board - I remember things far better if I pay attention to the visuals.

I also seem to have a very relative ""scenic"" memory, with objects and memories connected very specifically to a place, or certain people. Of course I don't know what it feels like to have a photographic memory, but some of the ways I've described remembering things to people led them to beleive that it was photographic memory (it's not) or unusually strong visual memory. 

I also have a way of visualizing everything in shapes (music and writing being two prominent ones). I know this is already somewhat of an INFJ trait as we see things in shapes, patterns and ideas, but it seems very linked to my memory.

I guess my own world is kind of like that feeling you get when you turn on music when walking/being a passenger and feel as if you're in a movie. That's what the inside of my brain is like.

I'm curious about your world, though. Do you believe you have one? Do you think you romanticize things, either positively or negatively?

I remember the first time I realized that trees grew out from the center of this big floating ball. I couldn't help but see the world in this totally new light. It was just this weird way of looking at the world. It filled me with this new level of awe at the rarity and craziness of this thing called life. 

My heart breaks over all of the posts lately coming from a place of sadness. Or places of sadnesses. Lately I've wanted to comment and say, ""Things will get better."" And in a way, they will. But mostly they'll be the same things. The things that change are you (the plural you, in more ways than one.). 

When you stand under a tree and look up, that's what you see - a tree going about its business and growing up. But are you *just* a person looking up at a tree? 

I don't pretend to know about any objective religion that is *true*, but that spiritual connection, that part of you that you KNOW is bigger than you, that's always there. Take time to feel, think, and breathe slowly. Whenever and wherever you can. 

The you (metaphorically and literally *plural*) that lives at that quiet place, the place where you get to be a badass infj, THAT futhermucker knows some shit. 

Look at that problem (bad problem or exciting problem) and be a badass. Empathy is hard to project inner and outer simultaneously, but that quiet badass can. And you are him/her and she/he is you. 

The ability to change perspectives is arguably tied to the ability to empathize. Think about it. If you change *your* perspective at or within the world, and your position in it or on it, everything makes sense in this new way. 

When you put seeds into the side of this floating ball, let that little patch of ground see this other giant floating ball millions of miles away, while also letting this stuff fall onto it from the sky (usually only in liquid form), things will grow up that you can chew and swallow, get bigger and stronger, process that chewed-up planet- growth, then go in and rub up onto someone, let them insert or take fluid from you, grow THAT stuff into another human being, that then can go around and plant seeds into other patches of ground and do the same shit, well when you think about all of that, sometimes the wonder of this world can make you see some other shit in some new light. *Your* light. Or whatever the fudge you want to call it.

I am wondering how many other people here have struggled with loneliness when it comes to the search for a significant other. I am 21 years old, and been single for 99% of my life. Last year I experienced for the first time what it is like to be in a relationship, but unfortunately that episode was very short lived, only about two months. Those two months were some of the best of my life though, during the time when I still thought it could work. For the first time ever I had been experiencing things that I assume to be second nature for most other people: what it is like to ""have someone.""

Most of my life I've been independent. I've never had a problem finding a best friend or really making friends in general but I just don't have any success when it comes to looking for that perfect girl. I've struggled with self esteem, anxiety, and confidence issues most of my life, but I think I'm working hard to overcome them. Maybe I am too choosey, maybe I'm just hard to get along with. Someone once told me that I'm hard to love, but I think I've come a long way and grown a lot as a person since I was told that.

Has anyone else struggled with this problem? All I want in life is someone who I can trust and love completely. Someone I can snuggle up with. The feeling I experienced when I had that, for those two fleeting months, was pure and total bliss. That sensation of lovingly cuddling up to another person is probably my number one dream in life because I've basically never had that. My biggest fear is that I will live my life alone and without a companion.
Has anyone else here had a similar experience? When did you finally find that perfect person, and under what circumstances? How can I get out of this rut of loneliness? I only want to love someone and to be loved back in return. I feel like this should not be so hard!

I know as personality types that are inclined to want to please people, we want to keep everyone happy and often go out of our way to do a good job on whatever task possible to impress others. 

Here is a really helpful hint for my fellow iN-- types: **It's okay to be selfish!** So often in the past, and even sometimes to this day, I feel a terrible sense of guilt for wanting things for myself, thinking people will view me as selfish. But then again, no one in this life is as important to keep happy as yourself. If you're not keeping yourself happy it doesn't matter how many good deeds you do for others. 


My best friend is an INFP and he is an extreme martyr. He spreads himself so thin between friends and jobs and extracurricular activities that he's constantly exhausted and unhappy. I've tried to bring it up with him before but the idea doesn't seem to stick. It seems that he tries to fill up his time with as many activities as possible because he feels that if he's not out in the world helping someone, he's not being a useful member of society. Which is both a respectable and crippling quality to have. 

A few days a week you should take at least a couple hours to relax with one of your favorite books, movies or albums and just let go of your stress. Don't feel guilty for thinking ""Someone else will take care of it"". Everyone needs a break sometimes, we can't all work 24/7 to impress others for their approval. I was surprised at the amount of posts I've read recently where people feel a massive amount of guilt worrying about what others think of them. Love yourself first and then decide how you go about pleasing others. 

**TL;DR:** Learn to relax yourself with things you enjoy and don't constantly worry about having to do good for others, just do what you can.

He's seen everything that I've done. He wouldn't cut me any slack because he's saw me coddling myself. He would probably describe himself as *the person I was meant to be and will never be.* He's every correct decision I should have made.  He's accomplished everything I failed to achieve. He is Aryton Senna in the passenger seat with me, Stevie Wonder, at the steering wheel. This bully was a self-appointed teacher ***who acted like the man I wanted to be***, dishing out advice in the form of insulting commentary on the failures in my life. He was the master and I was the student. 

About a decade ago, I could actually sit and have conversations with this bully when I was stoned. This amazed and scared my friends when on occasion, I'd present him out during smoke sessions for conversation. His opinion differed from mine in that, he felt the same way I did yet could explain his views with completely different and logical reasons from my own. He also spoke with an almost Mark Twain/Southern Gentleman-esque sort of sound which is strange to see coming out of an Hispanic considering the stereotypes Hollywood has branded upon us. What bothered me is that he was much more considerate of other people's feelings than my own.  His public face was non-judgemental and socially considerate, while his private face was critical and hurtful. I eventually discovered during one session, he was ***measuring me by standards that weren't my own*** and quite impossible to ever achieve.  And so he was wrong. But he was right in trying to knock me out of the complacency and comfort zone that I'd come to depend on as my shelter in my day-to-day life. 

He is what happens when too much self-critiscism turns into self-loathing. Self-criticism when constructive and brief, can be a useful tool. Too much turns toxic. Watch someone in a public place, rip someone else to shreds verbally every few minutes for an entire day. You wouldn't allow it to happen, right? Why the hell should you allow it to happen in your head?

Over time after I quit smoking, he quit popping up to throw in his 2 cents and doesn't actively speak to me anymore. Yet, when I try to decipher the reasoning of my feelings or calculate best course of action in any major situation, it's in his voice I am thinking in. He's somehow woven himself into my normal psyche and is no longer a bully. To be honest I kind of miss him.

**TL/DR: If you're forgiving of people's faults and failures, make sure to extend that same courtesy inward to yourself. Sporadic and brief self-criticism will help build a better person. But too much and too often will breed a monster inside that person. And that monster will not give a shit about how you feel while it tears you up from the inside out.**",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1eyjk7,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1eyjk7/how_i_deal_with_my_selfloathing_or_slaying_the/,

I feel like I finally understand why the world seems so obvious to me in some ways, when other people seem clueless in the same area. I always attributed it to my own intelligence and reading lots of books. I also see why I felt so disconnected from society overall. 

I don't know how to feel. I laugh as I read something that strikes home, that just feels like *me*.  At the same time I'm not far from crying. 

Since I can relate to all these things, its getting harder to dismiss this study. I've always wanted to be my own man, but now it feels as if though my existence is somehow predetermined.

I don't know how to feel, please, share your stories of how felt when you found out about your ""type"".
You don't have to be an IFNJ to answer, I'm curious about all of this. 

** **EDIT** **

Thank you for all of your replies. I feel better about the whole situation now. I believe that this can be turned around into a positive thing. 

Above all, I feel a **huge** relief. I don't feel as alone in the world as I used to. I have a few friends I can freely empty my mind into, but I don't believe any of them are IFNJ. I do not think that I am *fully* IFNJ myself either, but there is just so much I can relate to so I cannot dismiss it either. This is also very new to me, it'll take some time to figure it out. 

As humans we would like to select the positive parts of our type and shy away from the negative parts. I will try not to fall into this and try to better myself. What I will *not* do is to expose myself to the things that I hate (clubbing/excessive drinking, scornful assholes/backstabbers, shallow things such as facebook) on behalf on someone elses ideals or sense of what is right. 

Does anyone else feel as if though they go on a rant with a lot of valid points, yet when you proof-read it, it does not suit the context? I am feeling this now, I'mma just put this out here.

It never really bothered me before, but it's now completely overwhelming to the point where I can't even imagine being in a relationship or having anything other than a casual acquaintance.

It doesn't help that my morals have gotten more extreme as I've become more isolated. I used to have pretty mainstream views, but I'm now very interested in social justice issues, an ethical vegan, totally against drinking/smoking/drug use/sex without love (for myself, idc what other people do), strongly anti-consumption and I honestly cannot give two shits about the clothes I'm wearing or makeup. I go to school near NYC in a wealthy area. The majority of college students here party and drink to excess, and many people are obsessed with the way they look and material possessions. So I'm a total outcast in every way imaginable.

I also have some social anxiety, but the real problem is I see no point in trying to make friends with people who don't share the same worldview as me. Which I know I need to work on because I know hardly anyone I encounter is going to think the same way as I do, but these are issues that I feel are essential to who I am to a person.

I'm a 19 year old Male who had lived in the same neighborhood almost my whole life, and wanted to move someplace sunnier to help with depression. So I packed a backpack with my laptop and a weeks worth of clothes and moved to Southern California from Northern Oregon to live with family. Multiple times I've been flustered when a co-worker would ask a simple question such as ""Are you happier here?"" or ""Why did you move?"" (to which I have given five people 8 different answers, none of which I even believe are correct)

I think I have trouble answering the questions because I don't know how to describe the feelings I base my actions on. I was able to elaborate with someone *once*, but I talked for an hour and a piece and still didn't finish because I felt I might have been boring them. Now I don't even remember what I said to them because my mind kinda went blank and I started talking.

When I try to explain what I feel to myself (so I might be able to tell someone else if they ask), I usually back-track and contradict myself, then try and find a way to make the contradiction work out.

I've gotten so frustrated I have already turned in a two-week notice and have made plans to return to OR next week. At the time I thought I needed to go back, but now I am back-tracking and thinking that maybe just as bad a decision as moving to CA in the first place, if not a worse decision due to other reasons that would take too much time to get into.

I’m just hoping that someone in this subreddit can relate to what I have to say and maybe offer a word of wisdom or something along those lines. It isn’t often that I reach out for help to anyone, but lately I’ve been feeling just a little lost. 

Since leaving college and making my way on my own, I’ve lost pretty much all of my friends because we all moved and went separate ways. I’m guessing that it may be normal to feel sort of lost though because so much has changed in such a short amount of time. I don’t hate change itself; I enjoy it most of the time. It just takes me an abnormally long time to adjust to major changes. I moved twice in two years, from Eastern MA to Western MA, then to Southern CT. It has been quite a struggle, but I finally have a well-paying job that I enjoy, a loving boyfriend, and a couple new friends. However, I feel like I’m stuck on the nostalgia of the friends and adventures I had while in college and it’s been difficult for me to move on from that and just let go. 

I also have a huge problem with my confidence. I always had, and probably always will, but I want to try to get past this invisible hurtle. My lack of confidence probably started when I was very young. My parents fought verbally with each other and often took their verbal anger out on me as well. Constantly I was called worthless, no better than a speck of dust, you get the picture. It just wasn’t a very good time, and the fact that I wanted to go to art school just made it even worse. (My Father supported me, but since my Mother had failed out of art school herself, I ALWAYS heard shit from her, and my younger sister who was going to school for international business.) I’m not sure why, or if this has anything to do with it, but I’m attracted to objects that are defected. (Only sometimes now, but more when I was younger)  Like I almost feel bad for them, and end up buying them regardless because I respect and enjoy their differences and defects.  
Some days now, I wake up and can’t even look into the mirror because I hate the ugly girl I see. I always compare myself to what I want to look like and even though I’m not overweight, I feel like I am. I would like to dress a little less conservative, but I really hate my body and I think others will too. I love cute outfits and bathing suits and end up buying them but they never get worn. How does one just become confident? I really just wish that I could act like I’m the shit even if I feel disgusting inside. 

I’d love to hear other’s experiences as an INFJ and what obstacles you’ve overcome.

He was a good dog, but he was getting sick. He had lost control of his urine and was becoming irritable. He would leak pee constantly. But he was a good dog. A 9 year old male weimaraner.

When my mother and I went in to see the vet they weighed him. My dog was shaking because he was so scared. The vet wrapped an elastic around his front leg like a heroine junkie. 

My dog had this head-in-the-sand reflex in pressure situations where he would put his face between your legs and he liked if you brushed his soft ears. He immediately buried his face into my mothers legs. He was a baby just looking for reassurance of safety from his mother. 

When they injected the poisons, he fell lifeless to the ground. He laid on the floor the same we had hadn't for years, the way he laid as a puppy. His body was so empty. 

That's how he stayed. An empty body on the cold linoleum floor. I don't know if he know it was coming. I feel like when he was looking for safety from my mother while she gently rubbing his ears he was begging us... and saying sorry... and asking for another chance... telling us he'd be a good boy if we gave him another chance. But we didn't. 

As I write this I can't keep my composure. I am so afraid to love because once you love all you have left is to stop loving. Is it really better to have loved and lost that to never have loved? I don't feel better right now. I am afraid to get close to people because all people seem to do is hurt each other and leave.

I can't explain it - farms were my escape growing up, so I've been around horses and dogs as long as I can remember.  But when I look at an animal, the expression on its face and the look in its eyes resonate with me immensely.  Thus, I have a tendency to greet animals before their people, or I'll even spend longer kneeling on the ground than most people that ask the normal, ""may I pet your dog?""

Can anyone else relate to this feeling?  With people, even though I can empathize naturally and on a large scale, I tend to actively shut it down because of how much I've been shut out/written off by so many. 
 
Thus, in order to preserve the authenticity of my empathy, I keep it internal until my trust has been earned...and once it's been earned, I am the most loyal, giving and caring friend.  Without even thinking twice I will go out of my way for you - expecting nothing in return - because I want to.  Because I love to. I'll even do this for strangers that I feel are genuinely good people.

But as soon as my trust is broken...reverting back to the time before that is nearly impossible (I say nearly because although I'm willing to try depending on the person/situation, it's never been done before).  

So with animals, if they hurt me, I know it was instinctive and can be more easily rationalized.  But I feel like people have more control that they are either a.) unwilling to exhibit, b.) unable to exhibit (due to self-imposed or environmental limitations), c.) or don't know how to exhibit (and may or may not be willing to learn).  Even if the pain they ultimately cause is unintentional, they have the willpower to be in more control of their ultimate actions, so I even though I can say I ""forgive,"" deep down, I never ""forget.""

I know we face it all the time, and I definitely have to work on not internalizing others' behavior, but for the most part I just swallow a bitter mix of contempt, anger, and disgust, not to mention anger at myself for letting people cross my boundaries or letting someone's carelessness upset me.

And from what I've discovered, a very large part of it is what seems to me to be like a never-ending search for aunthenticity, in everything. Mostly in people and relationships, but also within the art and media I surround myself with, work that I or others do, etc. I've heard it explained this way before - each personality type wants to be the most (blank) in the room. And for us INFJs, it's the most authentic, and I've started to experience this personally even more. 

One of my major struggles with this has been my labeling of people, and their actions, as superficial and/or irresponsible. I'm a young INFJ (18) so improvement in this area is something I'm focusing on in my pesonal growth. But I feel that because of both the Ni and Fe functions, I can be extremely judgmental of some people's actions if I see them as fake, or irresponsible.

I'll use my most recent relationship as an example here. I'm not 100% sure, but i'm fairly sure my recent girlfriend (now ex) is an ESFP. As with many SP types, she lives extremely in the moment, and is probably the most extroverted person I know. She is very naturally flirty, and thrives on meeting people. She gets upset if she feels like she doesn't ""know"" enough people. Because of her extreme tendancy to live almost exclusively in the moment, and her introverted F function, at times she comes across as uncaring and out for instant gratification. To an INFJ like myself, this drives me absolutely balistic - the way it seems on the surface is that she isn't thinking about the consequences of her actions, because she's not able to see ahead to their consequences as well as I can. And her lack of ability to show her emotions deeply and outwardly makes it hard to know weather she actually cares or not. This is just one example of a person who I care about deeply, but seems to live a life that I, as an INFJ see as fake, people pleasing, and constantly dodging of emotional responsibly.

Since this is something that I'm trying to understand better so I can better attune my reaction to people like this, I was wondering if any other INFJs do/have had this problem. I'd appreciate insight, advice, or just reflection and discussion. These are just my personal thoughts on my experiences with this part of my INFJness",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_ydg5k,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/ydg5k/my_infj_experience_the_search_for_authenticity/,

Can we change?,noonAu,25,4,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/w805l/do_we_care_too_much_is_that_bad_can_we_change/,"I am annoyed, frustrated, and confused because I feel like I'm too focused on people and friends and relationships in my life and they affect me too much. When I feel like it isn't working well, or there is a problem in one of my interpersonal relationships, it stresses me to the point of obsessing over it....and I can't think about anything else until it's resolved or I become so upset or angry or hurt about the situation that I disconnect.

Do you think it could just be a personality trait, or is it something that I could potentially fix in a real way (as opposed to just coping with it or covering it up)?

I think any behavior is changeable, but relies on an honest want to change, but I think part of the problem is that I don't see why changing it would be a positive move. Also I don't know how I would change it if I did think it'd benefit the whole and not just my need to feel at peace. I know that if I continue to think this way (that it isn't really a positive move), it won't change.

If I changed it (how easily people and relationships affect me), then it'd be easier to ignore problems in relationships, and I feel like there'd be less intimacy and genuineness because I'd care less in some way. I am not sure how well that sits with me. Furthermore, if I did decide that I wanted to change it, the only way I can think of doing it would be to just keep myself farther removed from people, which I've done most of my life, and I don't feel is genuine, but a really immature defense mechanism as well as an excuse for keeping people at a distance. 

So would changing this be a step forward or a step back? Should I do it or not? Is change the answer? How should I change and what should I change to, and to what degree?

Any advice would be much appreciated... even if it's anecdotal. I feel lost, and like I can't breathe unless I figure this out.

This is kind of a weird thing to post on reddit, but here goes.  I'm a Christian, and I was going over some of my C.S. Lewis books, and had something of an epiphany about myself.  I wanted you guys' opinions or advice.

In *The Problem of Pain*, Lewis talks about the ""hole"" in every human being, the longing for God that people try to fill with money, sex, power, and all the rest.  In Lewis' view, we are not truly ""made"" for this Earth, but for Heaven, and we always long for our faraway homeland.  I don't know if many others here can identify with that, but for me, it was a revelation.

I have always felt that longing, that sense that I was never really at home anywhere, even in my own house.

I know it sounds insane; it sounds like I'm talking about fucking Narnia or something.  But in a way, I am.  I can feel it, deep inside, like a call just on the edge of hearing.  A call home.

You can get a basic scope of what type of person they are, their personality, what they like or don't like, and what means most to them. As you get to know people, it just builds on that based opinion. 

Now where I am curious about if you have experienced something similar is that moment something happens, or a person reacts just the way you knew they would. And not the kind of way that you've known them so long that of course you know their habits, but the kind of knowing that is so deep that they don't even know yet.

Example:

I just had a break up. Before we ended the relationship (it ended because I had to move to another state) I got this feeling that this person would start dating right away and his promises of friendship were crap. Now, we were dating for nine months and there was no foundation for this type of insecurity or thinking. I even told him that I didn't think we'd end up being friends, and he really didn't feel that was true.

He did end up dating a person (a girl I told him was flirting with him in the summer, who he said wasn't his type. I had suggested perhaps he should date her since they seemed like a better match. He was sweet and focused on me, but I find it kind of funny). 

Now I know this is a very... ordinary example, but things like this happen to me a lot. I know or see something, try to believe the other person, and then watch that something happen anyways.

Here's the deal: I usually have no problem having small talk with strangers, for example when I'm in a bar or in the grocery store talking with the cashier or whomever. I think this is because I'm not a shy person (anymore, at least) and I'm familiar with the social codes and rules in these kinds of situations, so I can adapt to the situation without much effort and act as my more extravert and witty self. In addition, I often feel like I have nothing to lose here: I just view it as having a nice encounter with a perfect stranger, nothing more, nothing less. If it does get awkward or boring, I feel like I have every right to say goodbye and leave.
With acquaintances and friends (okay not my closest ones), however, I feel super awkward and tensed when I have these random conversations, perhaps because I feel like there is a lot more to discuss and I also have the idea that I have to prove myself more or something. So for example, I feel really uncomfortable talking about the weather or random superficial stuff with people I know well, precisely because I know them and I know that there are more meaningful topics to discuss. 

I figured this might be an INFJ 'thing' when I talked about this with my bf who's an ENFP, and he admitted he felt the complete opposite: he's really uncomfortable talking to strangers but he actually has quite random conversations with his closest friends.

Looking at the terminology of Myers, an INFJ's introverted thinking function kicks in. Maybe this is related somehow? I wouldn't expect a brand new, glossy personality function to take out a lot of my defining traits though, seems very counter productive.

It's going to be a list because I find that's a calm way of organizing things.

To avoid heartbreak or at least, to avoid making it worse, I kinda wonder if anyone has any other little internal rules that might help. If so, post them in the comments.

1.No matter how much you love someone if you want different things out of the relationship it just will not work. Ever.

2.No amount of freedom will bring someone back if they're determined to leave.

3.Listen to your friends. Even your dumbest, most hair-brained of friends will probably know better than you do when you're in love. Love will make you very stupid. If they tell you that you're walking into a huge mistake, don't shut them out.

4.Listen to your instincts. Self control is only worth so much if you're not willing to actually tilt an ear to the loud voices in the back of your head that tell you something is a huge bloody mistake.

5.If being around someone starts to make you feel low, that's reason enough to not maintain a relationship. If your clothes, your shoes, your body, your music, or your friends aren't good enough and you find yourself under criticism for those things then it's best to find another person rather than try to change those things about yourself.

6.Giving in is necessary sometimes...but not all the time. If you find yourself giving in or supporting someone continuously, it's time to end things.

7.Your lover should ADD to your life rather than take away. Love isn't just give and take. It operates best when it's two people giving mightily.

8.Instead of permanence, fight for consistency. If you are consistent, love is much easier. Permanence doesn't exist but a consistent relationship will get you much farther than one with vows of 'forever and always'.

Myself, I would first get out of this apartment I am in. Get me a good car, nothing flashy or sporty (maybe a new Ford Kuga), I don't like to stand out. 

I am a sucker for high tech like 3D LED TVs, big ass surround systems, strong PC, ... so I would get that as well.

Then I would buy my mother a house, car and say to her: ""You don't have to work a day in your life anymore.""

Other family members, friends and coworkers would get their credits and loans payed off.

I would then help with the charity. That old hospital's AC ain't working properly? Here's a new one. Ambulance station needs new vehicles? No problem. 
Animal shelter is low on budget? You got it.
Certain family can't pay the bills? I'll do that.

I can safely say I would invest most of my money into charity. But no Red Cross or other stuff.

As I'm sure none of you are aware, there is a Minecraft Server for INTPs (/r/INTPcraft). It's been going on for about 2.5 months and has been fairly active. /u/nostalgicBadger, the creator, is starting a new server based on the full spectrum of myer-briggs aptly named MBTIcraft.

This server isn't a typical Minecraft server ('vanilla'), as there have been a few modifications made to it. The biggest and most important change is the addition of groups. That's right, you can play with all your INFJ buddies! Keeping this in mind, /u/C4Redalert and I have spent roughly a week designing a Central City to accommodate the different 'factions'. The use of this city is completely optional (go off and make your own city... with blackjack! and hookers!), but the coolest thing about this city is that each faction has its own district within the city walls and only that faction can build there. I'm looking forward to seeing how each town differs, but that's just me. 

If you're not too keen on sharing a world with everyone, you can travel to a private world where only your faction can build. People might stop by to take a gander, but you don't have to worry about them touching your stuff. Chase them away with a stick or something! We will also be featuring a currency system as well as shop/lodging rentals. They are features that we hope will help encourage an economy and immersive sense of together-ness, but your experience will not be hindered if you choose not to use them; your experience is what you make of it. 

We're not open just yet, but we will be in a week (Friday, 10th@8PM EST). We do have a subreddit open, /r/mbticraft, and /u/nostalgicBadger has a full-fledged website in the works so that we might be able to get our personalitycafe brethren on-board. Please do subscribe, equip some flair, and get ready to rep your type.

I'll try to answer any questions you might have for awhile, but it is a friday... so...

Recently at work we were discussing Myers-Briggs personality types, and whether or not we had taken one. My co-worker said that he hadn't, so he took a test today. The test revealed that he, like me, is an INFJ. 

The thing is, this co-worker and I could not be more different. The way we act at work, our manners of dealing with people, the types of issues we prioritise. In fact, I really dislike this co-worker of mine. We don't get along at all. I've always thought of us as so different to each other that it was a complete shock (and, for an instant, a bit insulting) to find out that he had the same personality type as me.

But it reminded me of something I was contemplating last night, the difference between a personality type and a personality. To me, the personality type is a set of behaviours and traits that a person is likely to identify with; while a personality is the subtle, nuanced immensely complex culmination of a person's being. It's kind of like the difference between genotype and phenotype -- the genotype is the code, the underlying genes that make up your physicality, while the phenotype is the expression of these genes, the outward physical manifestation.

It serves as a good reminder that, although we are all INFJs, individually we are a richly complex bunch of people. And, in some ways, it is our differences that make our similarities all the more miraculous.

The thing I want most in the world is someone who truly understands me who I can understand and connect with deeply. The second thing I want the most is solitude. Since the right people seem like a needle in the hay to me, the solitude feels really easy and natural. But I do get lonely, and it's been getting to me lately.

I'm an INFJ who is pretty much always single. I'm a 30 year old woman and my last relationship was 5 years ago. On the outside, it seems that I'm generally considered a catch. I have dated casually, but I've only been in 3 serious relationships, and I've never been with anyone for longer than a year. I'm horribly picky and fickle, and as soon as I feel that I'm not connecting in the way that I want, I usually disengage and feel unhappy. I've only been in love once, and I was very badly hurt. I felt the deep connection that I had been looking for my whole life, so when the guy broke up with me, I was really at a loss. I feel like a lot of people I've gone out with maybe don't need that deep connection that I really need.

In general, I'm really self-sufficient, and I'm much happier being single than being in a relationship where I don't feel truly comfortable. I think I've done a great job of building very meaningful friendships in my life, and maintaining close relationships with my family. I'm so used to being independent, and one thing that I like and need about my independence is all of my alone time. I currently work at a job where I'm around a lot of people, and my recharge time is vital to me. But I also get incredibly lonely. I currently don't feel the deep connection that I want so badly with anyone, and there are so many times when I would love to just have someone to talk to and understand me and hug me. My friends and coworkers and people in my life all love me so much - people constantly tell me how special I am to them, and how I make them laugh, and how helpful I am with my advice and making them feel loved. It feels so great to know people see this, but a lot of the time I still feel so disconnected, and that feeling can trump any of the other positive feelings.

My coworkers have wanted to set me up with people for awhile, and the idea of it really bothers me, mostly because I feel like they don't really know anything about who I really am. I suppose I should take more risks, but then coming home and just drawing and being alone with my cat and dog also feels like such a comfort that I need. I guess it's a catch-22. 

I know other INFJs deal with loneliness, but how do you reconcile loneliness and needing alone time, while still feeling happy? How do you keep yourself from escaping too much? At times I feel like too much solitude is holding me back, but it's hard to find a balance where I feel happy.",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1fy4rx,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1fy4rx/feeling_lonely_and_needing_alone_time/,

When alone or with a close friend, I feel words can be more relaxed and flow easier, causing an inspiration for a new song to be written or poem. 

I keep a notebook with me and I write funny ideas, odd faces, and extremely personal poetry, but in the back of my mind I think of how someone else would read my work, causing me to often change words or not be so direct in my meaning aka using strong metaphors or code words.

I figured out, over time, I could be freaky if I wanted people to stop bothering me.  

I have a very reserved temper, but the discovery that acting like a crazy person would get people to leave me alone was pivotal.  It helped that I was very tall and strong.  

Years on, I've tried for a long time to abandon this visage and, for the most part, I've been successful.  There are still elements of it that persist and now and then I run into (highly irrational) people who are simply instantly terrified.  No rhyme or reason.  Just instant fear.

It would be so much easier, if all I felt were my own emotions.  If someone screwed me over I could just say:""well screw you too."" and that would be the end of it.
Instead, I prioritze things like ""well so and so has really bad self-esteem issues, so they don't really mean it that way."" I can't even be a proper doormat because I'm too self-aware. I know that I have every right to say something and probably should. No one should think it's excuseable to treat you badly or take advantage of you, and if they do, they should apologize.

I think it's that iron sense of morality and our gigantic, mushy hearts that make us so ""complicated"" to others and ourselves. They're interlocked in a constant battle, because we'll never give up trying to do everything perfectly.

I thought I was an INTJ for a long time, and to a large extent, I still do.  I'm on the fence on whether I'm an INTJ or an INFJ.

I was raised in a mind-fuck home of verbal and physical abuse.  I remember as a child I was really sensitive and empathetic.  I still am, these qualities haven't been removed, but they're tempered by automatic responses towards logic and ignoring my own emotions to better see the objective reality.  I spent a large portion of my adolescence adopting 'rational' thought and trying to deaden my emotions, because as a child I was constantly being mindfucked by my father (always twisting situations to make it seem like I was in the wrong, always justifying anything he was against as bad, forcing me into situations I hated, etc).  So rational thought was my refuge, my safeguard, because otherwise I was always getting sucked into the mindgames my father played.

As I grew older though, I began to see that I was 'denying' a part of me that I had never been truly able to suppress.  But my rational/INTJ tendencies remain.  Even when I read this subreddit, I don't really identify with the general mood here.  I feel more at home in /r/INTJ.  However, it doesn't resonate with my 'natural' side.

For example, I've always been keenly sensitive to the mood and emotions of the room, or the other person I'm talking to.  I feel that my outwardly brusque or stoic attitude is a mask I use to deal with the world.  I've always felt that people like to tell me their secrets.  When I feel contempt for someone, it's only after I feel compassion.  My friends have always told me I'm really soft at heart, that I only seemed hard on the outside.

I could write more, I guess, but I suppose I should just summarize.  
tl;dr
I feel like I've lived my life on an emotional horse, using the reins of logic and reasoning to bring her under control.  I felt for a long time that I might just be a more emotionally-attuned INTJ, but now I'm having doubts.

I have a really quick temper, which is something that is a common fault in INFJs I believe. As well as that, I get really emotional really fast when there's an argument and sometimes lose the key issue while getting upset over minor details.

So lately I've been taking ten minute breaks the moment I realise I'm getting emotional. I calm down, breathe, get my head back into order and think about the things that I want to put across to the person I'm arguing with. It's worked wonders, disagreements end quicker and more rationally than before. I end up saying everything that's on my mind regarding the issue which is something that never happened before due to overwhelming emotions.


Hope this helps some of you lovely people as well :)

It feels like there's a sea of thoughts and emotions in my mind, and it's incredibly overwhelming to try and put it all together. I just want this calmness or peace of mind, but I can't figure out how to feel that. This is especially true when I'm alone (or at least feel alone). To cope I've been spending a lot more time in the company of friends. It helps me escape for a while, but it feels so contrary to my nature of wanting a decent amount of time to be alone. It hasn't been helping so much recently, though. There have been more frequent occasions where I basically wall myself off even around friends and sort of exist in my own space, but it's that very space that I'm trying to escape and forget. I'm not entirely sure why this is happening, but there a few things that I suspect may be contributing factors.

For quite some time now I've had a somewhat darker disposition. It's never really bothered me, I just accepted it for what it was. The funny thing is that I'm sure not a single person I know would be able to tell. I'm okay with hiding it and offering my more light-hearted side to my friends. But recently it's felt so much more bottled up. I don't know of any outlet or catharsis, so it manifests itself more frequently in my thoughts. Or at least that's what I suspect.  (Edit: This is definitely a catalyst for and influence of my art, which I talk about in the next paragraph. But my work isn't really a catharsis for some reason. For some reason there seems to be a sort of disconnect there, but I'm not really sure why.)

Another thing that's really been frustrating me recently is my studies. I'm studying a fine art. I do enjoy it, and I'm really quite proud of some of my work. I'm still fairly early on in my studies, though. The teacher that I've been studying closest with claims to see a lot of potential in me, and has been incredibly encouraging and helpful in the time I've worked with her. The issue with this is that I'm much more frequently criticizing myself in fear that I would let her down if my work isn't good enough. I'm constantly worried that she might see some of my new work and think to herself that maybe she was wrong in believing in me. This fear combined with my overwhelming thoughts has resulted in a huge lack of focus during my work time, to the point where progress is few and far between. That creates even more frustration in turn (as well as self-doubt in my abilities) and just continues to add to my problems. I know I'm capable of work that I'm proud of! But there's still this doubt that's come from all this recent frustration

I apologize. I meant for this post to simply see if other INFJ's feel the same, but it's turned into a bit of a rant. It feels good to have written it out, though.

The frustrating thing is that I'm actually pretty socially adept, and when I'm in a comfortable space, or around at least a few people I know well then I'm at ease. Work situations are also just fine.

I'm 25 and have yet to overcome the anxiety but I have started pushing myself into those situations a lot more. I still shut down a bit though, and my brain stops functioning at full capacity.

I'm a 21 year-old female and an INFJ. In my teenage years, I struggled with accepting myself and my introversion, but now I'm finally embracing who I am. No, I don't like to go out much, I have only a few very close friends and I really need my me-time. 
However, I also have these images and dreams in my head of things I need or want to do. For example, a few months ago I moved to Amsterdam and at first I was really excited: I wanted to go out, meet new people, discover the city etc. I had this mental picture in my mind of me having a huge social life, making friends and going outside - basically what the extroverted me would do. However, I don't consider myself an extrovert at all and all the things that were in my head, just seem too much to me. Sure, I've been around town and I've gotten to know a few people, but let's be honest here: especially in winter, I basically want to stay inside and explore the world from the comfort of my own house. This is fine with me - most times - although it seems to me that these dreams or desires of fully exploring the city (and also the rest of the world as I love to travel, or I should say, I love the idea of traveling) come back everytime, even though I know that doing all the things I 'want' just drain me out. Does anyone else have this too? And do you think it has to do with trying to meet an extroverted ideal? 

Just to be clear here, I think this also has to do with the common characteristic of many people to want more, more, more.

I don't know about you but I've been looking forward to this, the prospect of many INFJs being in the same place at the same time (sort off).

If you haven't already, create your flair. Click on ""edit"" next to your username on the side bar on the right, add your type (although many will probably be INFJs) and any other basic information. It's handy to see these next to your username rather than to refer back to your original comment. 

Introduce yourself, write as much or as little as you want, do AMA if you feel brave. Add any questions or ideas you want to discuss.

Things may be a bit quiet at first, so please check back again later as more people will join. Hopefully this meetup will be active for a couple of days, to the weekend.

Have fun and make some new friends.

**EDIT:** This thread is old now and probably can be concluded. It has been quite fun, although late visitors didn't get as much attention... Well there will be next times. I've been thinking, no matter how fun it is, weekly meetups seem to me a little too often. So this is going to be a monthly thing instead, on the first day of every month.

So I got invited out to a little party out in some woods where I live. Although I am generally quite wary of parties in general, and could easily be accused of being fearful of the unknown, I decided to come along just because. So me and my two friends went to the meeting point on the edge of town and we were took on a bit of a mystery tour out into the woods. The whole time I was speaking to everybody and having fun as we walked through the trees. Eventually we arrived in a clearing and in the middle of it was a large blow up tent sort of thing, a bit like a mini blimp. Anyway, we all got inside and listened to a performance of music, aswell as being invited to interact with tape recorders and balloons. We all had a lot of fun screwing around with the recorders and I felt really comfortable and at ease the whole time, despite the lack of familiarity in the situation and the strangers surrounding me. I also made some amazing contacts including a well established artist from japan and a really talented singer and musician, both of whom I felt I immediately clicked with :)

So yeah, I guess all I'm saying is that as infjs we can potentially be overly avoidant of social situations, but that if we can manage to overcome the anxiety inherent in uncontrolled or uncontrollable situations, we can actually contribute very positively to group dynamics. Although we are usually pensive, moody and terrificly deep, there is also a side to us that is spontaneous, light, funny and genuinely warm, all of these being qualities that allow us to very naturally connect with strangers and new people, so there is really no reason we shouldn't be the center of attention or the life of the party even if it isn't necessarily our preffered role. 

Yeah sorry this turned out so long, but the long and short of it is, if you're an infj in a rut, try something a little spontaneous and different. but whatever you do keep being the crazy badass mindreader you were born to be ;)",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1ghdgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1ghdgh/i_had_an_amazing_day_today/,

These realizations come with a certainty that demands action to fulfill a new vision of the future, solutions that may include complex systems or universal truths.*

Most INFJ are no strangers to anxiety, self-doubt, and rumination.  Over the last year, I have addressed this issue and helped myself a great deal with a few realizations.  The foundation of the ideas and values I have developed (to help myself) are best explained in an old blog post of mine: [MeusIntuitus](http://meusintuitus.wordpress.com/2012/03/22/meditations-on-anxiety/).

Big picture:  The key here is to use our extremely powerful INFJ value systems to overcome the anxieties that we consider to be limiting.  Our anxieties are a result of our perfectionism--so just create in yourself a deep, intense, philosophical appreciation for mistakes, awkwardness, *imperfection* and you will be able to shut down the anxieties of almost any situation.

Since writing that post, I have attached something to my weapon against anxiety--charging it with sexual assertion.  As an aside, I'll note that I am a male INFJ so I will use masculine terms, but you can just as easily replace masculine with feminine here (hehe):  **A real man does not beat himself up over events transpired.  Rather, a real man speaks, acts, thinks with conviction--he takes full responsibility for his words, actions, ideas.  In every day of life, a man will exhibit both brilliance and folly.  A real man fully accepts both outcomes because he understands that both are necessary.  Folly is the seed of adaptation.  Imperfection in the one is perfection in the whole.  Exhibit your perfection without remorse.**

Edit:  The tendency of some (certainly used to be true for me) might be to try to avoid thinking about something that happened--definitely *don't* do this; the memory of the event and the anxiety/regret/self-deprecation will only pop back into your head at a later time.  Instead, force yourself to think about the event, acknowledge how ashamed/etc you feel about it, and then *forgive yourself*; after that, go a step further, laugh, and congratulate yourself.",,False,,t5_2r39a,1348267389.0,,,True,t3_109nmj,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/109nmj/using_ni_to_overcome_selfdoubt/,

But I recently posted a thread ([here](http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1grxq6/please_help_me_understand_my_boyfriends_very/)). People said I should leave my bf. I understand, but I'm not going to, but I do appreciate the sentiment. I am an INTJ btw. 

Here is the situation; my bf is a very strong INFJ who is under a lot of stress. Every time one of his friends rejects his attempts to be emotionally vulnerable, slights him or criticizes him, he reacts very badly and blames them as being bad friends (he doesn't do this with me but does this with friends). 

This is making it very hard on his close friends. One of his close friends is an INFP who doesn't like to get close (part of her upbringing). She is learning to open up more to him but any time she slights him (in very understandable ways, if still wrong) he gets very upset. 

In the past, they had made plans to be roommates. But because of his intense reactions, she has been trying to get out of it. In the end, she told him recently that he would be hard to live with.

He was livid. He see's other people but when they leave at night, he will tell me that he didn't actually enjoy their company because he is mad at everyone besides me and his family. He only actively seeks out my company. He is craving close friends but he is afraid to face up to his part to play and change. 

Well, I recently got the courage to say to him; have you ever considered that X friend is right, and you would be hard to live with? He then stood up and left the house. He then came back, and broke down. He eventually composed himself again but went back to refusing to acknowledge his faults.

I don't want to criticize him. I don't want to point out his faults. I don't understand why but he has zero self-esteem (I really don't know why besides it seems like something inherient to his personality). But I am starting to make some progress and the only way to truly make progress is for him to, FRANKLY, lighten up and become more forgiving and stop taking everything so seriously. He is so quick to criticize others but any time anyone criticizes him he can't take it.

So, INFJ's; how do you criticize someone who (despite numerous talents) has no self-esteem? How do I help him come to terms with this flaw and help him overcome it to achieve the life that he **wants**? I am worried for his mental heath right now.

***INFJ Identity Status Update:***

**Over the course of the past month:**

* Discovered /r/mbti, took tests, denial, anger, painful emotional event, breakthrough, acceptance, revelation, empowerment

* Discovered limits, predispositions, weaknesses and strengths.

* I know myself a little better now than I have ever before. 

* I've redefined the direction of my life and my short/long term goals to accommodate to my personality type.

**The Real World Change:**

* I've learned that love is not just a feeling but also an action. So when I wake each morning, I make a conscious decision to treat everyone I meet, with love and compassion. I assume the people I come into contact with everyday suffer through much harder lives and deal with much bigger problems then I could ever imagine. 

* I've changed my approach from; self-absorbed, entitled, and smart-ass, to benevolent, grateful, and smart enough to know I should probably just shut up and listen without judgement or wisecracks. 

* I've learned by setting 3 alarms everyday to take 3 minutes to think about the important people in my life for whom I love and value. 

* At the end of each day, I reflect as I jog because I know one day I will miss the ability to jog. I find meaning and enjoyment in the activity as the sun lowers over the brush-lined horizion of the Texas countryside. 

* I finish everyday with an ice cold shower. We have hot water but I've started using cold water to remind myself that if I am to get anywhere in life, I need to be willing to become comfortable with being uncomfortable. I've been been doing this for 2 weeks already.

* I've also influenced a couple of my coworkers on the drilling rig to jog with me every other day. At first they gave me excuses when I asked if they wanted to go. I told them that I wasn't trying to tease them or embarrass them. I just wanted to help them actually push for their health and fitness goals so the could spend a little more time on this earth with their loved ones.

* I no longer drink, watch porn, or play video games. Haven't felt the need or been tempted to. No my only vices are Reddit, podcasts and audiobooks.(I don't want facebook to become one.) 

* I seek out conversation with my peers whom have different or opposite views from my own. I do this to sharpen my communication skill and get a perspective different from my own. My belief is that I will never grow if I am around like-minded people. I am also very careful to never offend other's views when reaching a subject they're passionate about.

Does anyone else have similar issues to this? I feel hopeless and like I've come up against a giant brick wall separating me from my future of being independent. I feel a huge amount of guilt for basically being an adult moocher to my parents, and I'm trying to find ways to change the way of thinking I've been raised with. I probably sound like a whiny privileged child, which I have been most of my life, but I'm trying to break out of that mindset. The first step is realizing you have a problem, right?

After reading [this thread](http://redd.it/1cgbnd), I discovered that my strong desire to share things with those around me is apparently an INFJ trait.  I find myself frequently thinking, *OMG that was hilarious, I need to remember it so I can tell everyone* or *EVERYONE I KNOW NEEDS TO HEAR THIS SONG!*

Sometimes, I decide to share these things on reddit.  But a lot of time, no one cares, and I get downvoted to oblivion (I genuinely could*n't* care less about karma, I just want to share things with people!).  But people in this subreddit care.  Honestly, this is one of the friendliest subreddits I subscribe to.  Maybe it's our strong sense of empathy, I'm not sure.

Anyway, I thought it might be cool if we all had a place to just *share things*.  If y'all are interested, and if this thread does well, I figured we could have a weekly ""Show and Tell"" thread.  We can start it on Mondays, and anyone can go back throughout the week to share things - a photo you took, a new song you discovered, a funny bumper sticker you saw on your way home, etc.

What do you all think?

Go ahead, let's see what you've got to show!

Truth #3: In the words of the late great Jim Morrison, when you're strange, noone remembers your name.  I've found this to be true both figuratively and literally, being an INFJ.

Solution: Like any good solution, it's both incredibly simple yet incredibly hard.  Don't give a crap about what anybody thinks about you, i.e., to thine own self be true.

In my experience as an INFJ, as many others have voiced here, I am ultra empathetic to the world around me. For example, when I listen to a song I can portray the song's emotions -- I seemingly ""connect"" to the artist's message and mood. Sometimes, it's not even the lyrics, it's the composition, the musical theory. Same goes for social communication, reading a book, going to an art museum, etc.

In this state, I can visualize the perfect scenario for the music, where the story unfolds like a book already written; I can understand a person's motives, even if they're unknown to the person; I can see past the pages of a book, and understand a writer's central idea; I can ""feel"" the painting hanging on the wall at the art gallery. In this mindset I feel like I'm not creating a vision, but embracing a hidden truth. 

From what I've read here, we INFJ's have that power of vision-like intuitiveness, and it's absolutely extraordinary. It's uncanny and unique -- and I feel this overwhelming sense of duty to share it.

I feel if we are the couriers of a deeper truth, we need to deliver a message to the masses that needs to be known. And I know that it may seem narcissistic to say we have this privileged ""duty"", but I could not feel more the opposite. I have self esteem issues, I struggle with anxiety and depression, but these are the torments of an artistic personality. We are all artists with different canvases, and we need to paint the world with our vision.

As French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin noted, ""We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience."" With our motives, which are even difficult for us to define, we push the human race forward with our ideas. That's the duty I feel. As INFJ's, we may not feel important, but we certainly are.

1372944747.0,17,self.infj,1hmrvt,Has anyone else had their empathetic/giving nature taken advantage of? Is it hard not to continue the vicious cycle? Personal story inside...,maebymaybenot,18,1,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1hmrvt/has_anyone_else_had_their_empatheticgiving_nature/,"Long text is long-

Roughly four or five years ago I met this friend through the internet through a mutual fandom.  I'll call her C.  I was going through a really hard time in my life, and this fandom was a huge support group in a sense.  C was also going through a hard time in her life.  She was dealing with an emotionally abusive mother just like I was.  I offered to help C in any way I could, because I've always been incredibly giving of myself, and I knew how scary it was to be in my situation.

My mother died, and things almost began to settle down for me.  I was without the turmoil, but I was left with nothing.  No money, no place.  I'd had to take care of my mom while she was dying of cancer, and had nothing to show for it.

Finally, an ex-boyfriend and I decided to move in together so that I no longer had to live with my sister and her in-laws.  That's when C called in her favor.  She asked me to pick her up and save her from her situation.  Then, before I'd even gotten in my new apartment, she pushed the timetable up, saying it had to be that night.

So my sister and I drove over 600 miles in one night to pick her up and bring her back with us to live in my new apartment with my ex-bf and me.

It took C three months to even find a job.  In that time, she would be on the internet at all times of day and night, messing around with fandom but not doing anything productive.  It was a huge stress for me, but I never got mad at her because I wanted to shelter her from the stress she'd had in the past.  She finally got a job that I had to drive her to and pick her up from (at 2 in the morning).

Changes happened.  My ex-bf moved out, so it was just me and C.  For a brief while, things seemed fine.  C and I would both attend school.  We'd both watch movies together.  It was nice.  Then C would have random days where she didn't go to school.  She just slept all day.  I always had to coax her and make sure she finished her classes, like I was her mom or something.

Suddenly, out of the blue, she decides she wants to go to another state for the summer.  C is unable to plan ahead, so she isn't going to be paying rent while she's gone.  She isn't even willing to find someone to temporarily take her place in the apartment.

At this point, I've decided that I want to live on my own for the first time in my life.  I have a new job, and I'm tired of taking care of C.  I tell her I'm going to move before she goes on her trip for the summer, and I make sure she knows she needs to find a place by the time she gets back because my new place will be too small for her to stay in.

Not only do I have to move and store all of her belongings, but she puts no effort into finding a new place whatsoever in the whole three months she is gone.  When she gets back, she crashes at my place for three weeks before I HAVE to kick her out because my sister is staying with me for awhile.

C eventually finds her own place, and the rent is super cheap (less than 400) but she needs a cosigner.  So, feeling guilty for not wanting to live with her anymore, I cosign on her place, assuming she'd hopefully be able to keep up such a small payment.  (Her entire payments per month, bills, rent etc come out to less than $500).

Not the case.  She fails out of school.  Loses financial aid.  And doesn't even TRY to find a job before her rent is due again.  She told me she had money for rent, but she was way off.  (Had less than $40 in her account.  Thought she had over $300. Who makes a mistake like that??)

Now I'm struggling to help her find cash to keep her apartment, but I'm at my wits' end.  This is a person who has used me more times than I can count.  I've spent hundreds of dollars on her, and her return in friendship is minimal at best since half the time she lacks even basic empathy.

I'm sick, and lost, and the worst part is that I gave her an ultimatum that I won't be taking care of her anymore, and I feel terribly guilty about it.

My ex and I were together long distance for 6 years. Toward the end of our relationship, we both got to be really bitter and very mean to each other, often ignoring phone calls or picking fights about petty things. We were both so tired of being apart for months on end only to spend a week with each other before being separated again. Having a relationship over the phone was getting to be really exhausting, and the way that he was treating me was bordering emotional abuse. Things got worse and worse until I was ready to break up, and I also believe that he was doing things to try to force me to break up with him. We finally split up in early spring of last year and I began dating someone new in June.

Fast forward to today. My new SO and I are so happy together. He is completely different than my ex - he is respectful of me and my needs and always looks out for my best interest. Things feel so natural and comfortable. We can sit in silence and it's not awkward, and most importantly, he understands my need for solitude and is never a drain on my energy. Even though we have only been together for a year, he has quickly become my best friend and I truly feel like he is my soul mate. 

The only problem is that my ex is still hanging on to the false hope that I will come back to him. He texts me randomly to say that he misses me, sends me emails with links to depressing music, will call me out of nowhere and leave a voice mail saying how much he hates me and that I'm a huge bitch and bane of his existence, only to call back 10 minutes later and say that he loves and and that he's so sorry for being mean. I feel horrible knowing how much he's going through and how badly he's hurting, but I love my SO so much, and I feel guilty every time my ex tries to contact me. When he does talk to me, I will sometimes respond because I feel like I'm hurting him if I don't. However, I've made it clear to him on at least 3 occasions that I have no plans of getting back together. I don't mind him checking in with me or saying hi every now and then, but this isn't working anymore... he does not understand boundaries, and he is becoming more clingy and needy. 

I understand that I am allowing (or maybe even encouraging?) this to an extent, but it is getting to be really unhealthy for both me and my ex. We need to cut ties before it affects my current relationship, but I don't know how to do it without hurting him. I've never cut someone out of my life before, and I'm really dreading having to do it. I feel so guilty, and I can feel the pain that it will cause him and it makes me sick to my stomach. What is the correct way to end communication completely?

TLDR: I need to completely cut off communication with my ex, but I don't know how.

With a romantic partner especially I tend to think about them all the time, either circling around a problem ad nauseum, obsessing about how he is feeling/thinking about me in that moment, just thinking about what he may be doing/thinking/feeling (dumb, he's a 7 hour time difference away for the next few months for work, so the answer is, sleeping :), what I should be doing to make things even better than the awesomeness they typically are,  or daydreaming about our future (that part is mostly fun but can be intrusive on other stuff I should be doing.) The same goes for conflict situations with a friend, co-worker or even stranger. If this is an issue you have, and the real solution is simply to accept what is happening, or to be patient and see how it plays out, how do you break yourself out of the pattern in order to focus your thoughts on other, more constructive things?
These don't always work for me, depending on how powerful my feelings are in the moment, but sometimes they help:

-Focusing on a very concrete, relatively easily resolved 'problem' (fixing something around the house, doing a crossword puzzle/playing a video game (if its too mindless i will multi-task obsession and game playing), work on a craft/art project.)

-Focusing on other people (this works best, but I don't always have the strength to do it)-going to visit a friend, go to my volunteer job, call my  family.

-Put my thoughts down in writing. This can backfire.

-PUT THINGS IN ORDER (This is really helpful too. Tonight I had a bunch of coffee to stay up, and cleaned my apartment late into the night, and did't have one circular thought even though I had a workday full of them.)

-Escapism- SOMETIMES, if it is very engaging, watching a movie or tv show, reading a book or listening to a podcast will help. But the wrong kind could send me back into a spiral if it is too ''topical'' :)

But I don’t see the purpose

They say they see all sides

But only see in 1 dimension

They say they’re there to listen

But don’t even pay attention

And include them in my plan

The old day is done and yet it lingers

On the eve of this somber evening

The wind passes on the house’s fingers 

Encourages the mind’s endless thinking 


As the midnight bells of the towers ring

My mind is filled with permanent curses 

The lyrics in my heart began to sing 

And I urge the pen to write the verses 

I cannot write what my cursed mind holds true 

To write down the words within my heart 

The unwritten story long overdue 

Of feelings hurt and a lost, lonely part

Will be gone and forgotten in a blink

So I must start my tale in lasting ink

1367517838.0,17,self.infj,1dkc25,I brought this up in another post... but I have some issues with INFJs relying heavily on intuition,iamafascist,19,2,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1dkc25/i_brought_this_up_in_another_post_but_i_have_some/,"Before I bring in my points, I'd request that no one take this personally or as an assault against their intelligence.  I just want to bring up a viewpoint that seems divergent from what personality profiles have to say.  I recognize that the majority of us are very thoughtful, self-critical individuals.

There's a commonality in a lot of the descriptions of INFJs, and other intuitive types, that our intuition is very strong.  Recently, an article was linked here titled, [""Top 10 Things Every INFJ Wants You to Know.""](http://www.bradgarbus.com/Personal-Details/personality-profile/istj-personality/infj-articles/top10thingseveryinfjwantsyoutoknow)  In the article, it says:

""We ""just know"" a lot of information that we can never fully explain. Many sensing types and a few intuitive types cannot fully grasp our level of intuition and easily discredit our knowledge. Without any explanation as to why, we can feel the feelings of everyone around us as deeply as though they were our own... believing in our intuition is the best thing you can do.""  

But I think it is fair for others and ourselves to question our intuition.  Perhaps our intuition will be accurate in reading feelings of individuals we know fairly well, but otherwise it really is largely assumptions.  That is what intuition is:  the ability to acquire knowledge without inference and/or reason.

I just worry that r/INFJ and the MBTI test may overly boost our confidence in our intuitive skills when we should always be cautious of them.  I worry that sometimes we might use the word ""intuition"" when ""assumption"" might be more appropriate.  Now I'm not saying this is always the case, but it very well may be the case sometimes.

To have it just be the folks from infj (and/or people who come across the sub, hehe), it'd probably be better to have 'registration' though a Google Docs survey (well, it's called ""Form"") where people can fill out their info and whatever else, then match people up by hand (or generator :P).

From what Pokemen says, I do think it would be easier to do our exchange through a Google Docs survey- I thought about googling how to make one, however I'm currently between computers right now, and if there is anybody on here who wouldn't mind setting up some of the basic stuff here, making our google thing, and us figuring out a way of matching,  I, personally, would certainly be grateful!

Just as a side note, I also think if everybody is ""ok"" with it, it might be easier to call it a postcard exchange with an optional mix or small whatever, assuming that some people might not have the funds, and also knowing my own personal infj tendency towards trying to make the perfect mix and hand-drawn art but procrastinating till the very end, nonetheless.

It's not that I'm slow, I'm actually impatient and hurried oftentimes.  But when I let go, I'm on my schedule and I let myself really dive into and enjoy the process of getting ready to go, the process of going to the store, etc.  and I get lost in it.  I lose all sense of rush and of time. I've come to warn people (not that it's not quickly apparent that ""I'm on my way"" means ""see you in an hour or more"") to double the time frame I give them.  I often notice that in conversation I don't always think linearly.   

That said, I have minor anxiety issues about being late and about others not arriving on time.  

How about you guys?  How do you relate to time?

Every single thing fits me to a T. He is a very logical INTJ who fits into it very well.

This conversation happened when me and him were on Skype and I mentioned that I wanted us to have a black kitty when we live together. To which he said he wasn't a fan of black cats and I said I loved them and he said ""I don't want to talk about hypothetical questions that may or may  not happen 2 years from now"". This was my written response because I articulate better in writing than in words.

I just...i know it sounds retarded to you because you aren't as emotionally ""lovey"" like i am.

Do any of you have traits of ADD? (I have a few - I have trouble reading things unless I highlight them so I'll focus.)

Do you ever have those times where you feel like you've stepped in the back of your mind? Where you aren't really thinking about anything but the majority of your attention isn't on what you're doing..
For instance - when this happens I go on extreme auto pilot when I'm driving or doing other tasks but I may not necessarily be thinking about anything.

Also, recently I'm stepping over to the ""other"" side of the INFJ coin..
Got rid of the depression but I'm still working on my self esteem. It doesn't help that I don't have very many people.. But I'm working on it.
Is anybody else going through that?

Do you have trouble caring about yourself?

Prior to this relationship, I casually dated a number of guys but didn't really give my heart or date for an extended period of time.

However, when I started dating a male ENFP (late 20s), things ""clicked"" instantly from the get-go.  We were really in tune with each other emotionally, we shared the same ideals, we shared relatable experiences, etc.  Over our five-and-a-half month relationship, things were great.  He's an A+ guy (yes, I still think this).  But last month he called things off because he felt like we were in different places in life (which he had legitimate reason to believe, but I disagree with him in that our relationship had to end before even trying to make things work.)

At any rate, this is my first ""real"" breakup and I'm having a really hard time processing it.  He was the first person I let ""in"" and I just feel like we worked out as a couple so well (until we didn't.  heh.)  I know that the relationship is over, and my 'J' very much doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who doesn't want to be in a relationship with me.

Also, I may or may not have stumbled upon this reddit recently^~~today~~ and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of stories all of you have that are similar to mine. I figured I could use a little more condensed version here, if that's okay with you guys? :)


To start off, here's mine, and, again, I apologize, in case I share anything that may be considered tmi:


**When and how I found out I was an INFJ:** Took one of the many mandatory counselling tests in college. Didn't really care much for it, because before the MBTI test, there was also the *this is a blotchy picture of something black what do you see* test and the *tell me what story this picture tells you* test. I figured it's just one of those off the counter psychoanalysis crap. Turns out, it's not. I learned more about myself after learning what type I am. Also, it triggered a lot of internal (mental, but due to the immensity of it all, it manifested in the physical) crisis in me.


**How other people perceive me:** Weirdly enough, some have described me as loud (which I can attest to, at times). The more typical descriptions are emotionally closed-off, against all forms of physical contact, part-time vice grip for someone's problems.


**How I perceive myself:** Mostly negative stuff like selfish, hypocritical, fake and/or robotic, fickle-minded, judgemental. Most of it stem out of my so-called intuition (I say so-called because I can't even seem to bring myself to trust, well, myself) ie. Me trying to understand another person = me being judgemental, not really intuition.


**How I interact with people:** *I don't*. Not if I can help it. But if I have to, I always feel like I'm reading some sort of pre-defined script in my head, and I try to figure out what kind of conversation/circumstance I'm getting myself into so I can come up with the proper response. *Proper* being relative, it can range from what would probably sound respectful (when I talk to someone I don't know) or what would probably sound like what they'd wanna hear (when I talk to someone who I know, like a friend of sorts).


**Your ideal type/past/current significant other:** Someone who will be the rock to my everything. I feel like I'm in shambles very often and I need someone to constantly hold me and tell me that I have to trust myself because it's a gift, not a source of self-pity.


**Other stuff that I just wanna share/get off my chest/figure out if you guys feel/do the same lol:**

- Feeling of not being able to identify who I am as a person. I can understand other people, but I can never understand a lot of things concerning myself. I feel like I'm always leeching off of other people's personalities and it's just layer after layer or a ""new me"" that I don't know who the ""first me"" is anymore

- I recently have come to a realization that I am all for intimacy. I crave it. Although it must be said that I've never been intimate with anyone, physically, emotionally, or mentally. So I'm not sure if that's strictly 'cause I'm basically a virgin (ha, there it is) or it's really an INFJ thing. But yeah, I feel like if I ever find the right person, I want to be really intimate with him on every level. I read/watch a lot of things that involve different kinds of intimacy, and it always pulls out the same feelings from me.

- As much as I think I'm more judgemental than intuitive, whichever it is, it's been helpful at--excuse the usage of the word--*charming* people. They either think I'm really nice (I kind of am, not just the same level most people trust me to be lol) or really friendly.

- I'm passive-aggressive and I hate confrontation. I try to be mature about it but when things pile up, I just tend to shrug and put a poker face. Instead of trying to calm down and find out the real source of the mistake that 'caused the confrontation, I blame myself for it (regardless of the truth behind the claim) and let it manifest in internalized anger. Which, in turn, is useful at times, because I tend to become more focused on the task at hand (which is a weird reaction).

- I'm at a loss, career-wise. I graduated with a degree in engineering, which I know in my heart is worth nothing. I'm currently working at a fast-food joint type of thing, which I thought I would find repetitive and mundane, but it turns out, I have a knack for it! Which kind of helps because I've always wanted to be a chef when I was a kid, and whether or not I wanna pursue that, this job earns me some cash and builds my resume a bit. I'm planning on going to school, but I'm not sure which career path I should take. I'm torn between chef, counsellor, teacher, and psychologist. Tuition wise, the last three worry me. Future/Income-wise, the first one worries me.

While researching the general interactions between INFJs and ISTJs, our jaws dropped in understanding of what our major issue was with each other - miscommunication.  

Negative interaction:  I always seem to misread him, which is weird to me, and when tense situations happen between us, I tend to go introvert and need alone time to figure out my feelings and then figure out where to go from there.  He, on the other hand, would rather handle it in a more logical fashion and talk things out then and there, which can sometimes overstimulate me, cause me stress, and make me almost desperate to get alone time; this sometimes causes me to lash out - nice me goes away and my inner bad comes out, as if to push him away long enough for me to have time to collect myself.  When I go introvert and want alone time, he tends to take it personally because he reads it as me being angry at him, though I'm only angry at/frustrated with the situation.

Positive interaction is us basically being ourselves with each other, sharing our introverted selves with each other by being less introvert around each other.  While I express thoughts and feelings in an open manner with him (took a while for me to even do), he expresses his thoughts and ideas with me, and so our thoughts can match up and we can have a good time with it; sometimes our feelings will match up and he will bring out his feelings, albeit very rarely, but when there is an understanding between us with our feelings, it goes really well.  When he's stressed out from work, I do my best to have him come home to a stress-free environment in which he can relax and collect himself.

So as INFJs, I'm sure you all understand me when I say that I give my relationship with my long-distance bf nearly everything I've got.

Well, this is taking a huge toll on me. I am studying for my Masters degree, and have had a whole lot of work on my plate this year. Whenever I have a free weekend, I go visit my bf, and sometimes this means that I have to work every day for 2 entire weeks in order to get my work done. I have no social life where I'm currently living, and so my only down days are the days I spend with him. Basically, I'm giving this relationship everything I've got, but he rarely, if ever, comes over to visit me. I'm alright with that because seeing and being with him is always the biggest reward. The reality of being with him is always far better than my fantasies. Regardless, I've been trying to juggle my coursework and relationship for far too long, and I think this weekend I hit my tipping point.

I came up to visit him this past weekend for a music festival, which was the first time I've seen him in 2 weeks (which is basically the norm for us). I knew going into the weekend that he was going to be working horribly long 16 hour days as sound-man and that I was barely going to see him, which was fine by me. I knew that at the end of the day he would be absolutely exhausted and would want to crash and reboot for the next day's work. But I didn't expect what actually happened. Yes, he came back tired as hell, but he also cast me aside. He didn't want me to touch him or really be anywhere near him. That hurt so much more than not seeing him for 2 weeks. Needless to say, I was not warm with him by Monday morning, and vice versa. We didn't fight, we were just cold. Anyways, he ended up hurting himself at work and had to go to the hospital, the poor thing. Now he's in a full leg cast for the next 2 weeks. I was supposed to go back to uni on Monday but ended up staying and taking care of him until yesterday. We talked over our feelings the night it happened, and everything is fine now.

This really got me thinking... Yes, I have too much love to give, but that's alright. What I'm having a problem with is my expectation that my love will be returned all of the time. But that sometimes doesn't happen. My reasoning is that if I'm putting in all of this effort into a relationship, I should at least get a bit of consistency with his affections. I understand that this kind of thinking is very very rigid, but I don't really know how to break out of it... and it's starting to take its toll on me.

I've always been very sensitive and introverted, and so being bombarded by all the news coverage is really affecting me. I feel like I must be a terrible person with no emotions because I don't post roses or memorials on my Facebook page. I don't want to analyze the suspects, I don't want the latest updates. I want to grieve quietly.

I understand some people need to discuss these things with others and that's their way of grieving, but I'm just so darned empathetic that it hurts to hear it. All I can think is, ""those poor people under lock in must be so scared"" and even ""Those poor boys are just kids, how angry they must have been. I wish I had been there to help them.""

But I see these people around me who would hate me for such thoughts. I feel like I'm not patriotic enough because I grieve for these kids just as much as the victims. I should be filled with the same curiosity and desire for revenge that it seems like everyone else is.

High-functioning autism (HFA) is the condition of individuals who display some symptoms of autism but who are able to function close to or above a normal level in society. HFA is sometimes also known as Asperger syndrome. In everyday terms, those who are affected by it may be understood as being ""eccentrics"", ""nerds"", ""geeks"", or termed a ""little professor"" or boffin.  

The term Asperger syndrome is sometimes used in the same sense as HFA, but the exact difference between autism, Asperger syndrome, and HFA varies. There are a range of deficiencies and talents in HFA, the precise configuration of which can vary widely from individual to individual, ranged along a continuum.

There is a high correlation between HFA characteristics and those described in the Myers-Briggs INTP profile [1] description. Another theory states that Asperger's correlates to the INTJ personality type, whereas HFA correlates to the INFJ personality type.

Why do INFJs seem to have difficulty getting along with their own gender? Is this actually a common trait? Is it equally common among men and women? How do the gay/bi/trans among us feel?

What follows is my personal story-- not required reading to get into the discussion.

I'm an INFJ male. My entire life, I've had an easy time with girls. From having girls as friends, to having a girlfriend at pretty much all times since puberty-- it got me into a bit of trouble in high school. I get along great with my mom and little sister.

Guys, on the other hand? My group of friends until high schools pretty much kept me around as an easy-target; I was frequently physically bullied. My father is an overly Alpha douchebag who abused my mom.   From high school on, I did better-- but I mostly only kept guy friends because I felt like I had to to be normal-- or to enhance my ability to appeal to and get girls. I almost never ""like"" guys in the same way I do girls when seeking non-sexual companionship. They just seldom appeal to me as likable individuals. My girlfriend of 5 years makes fun of me for it. ""Of course you don't find her annoying, she's a girl!"" My standards for liking a person seem to be much more relaxed if they are female-- and this is barely affected by physical attractiveness.

So, based on my life experiences, it makes perfect sense to me that I don't like guys as much. I had a very easy time getting positive feedback from females; I had a very hard time getting positive feedback from males. I always assumed this was just because INFJs are stronger emotional/verbal and weaker at competitive and aggressive stuff. Also explains why, from what limited contact I've had, I enjoy gay men very much.

But girls in this sub-reddit seem to have difficulty getting along with other girls-- completely throwing a wrench in my whole carefully thought out explanation for why I dislike my own gender.

Possible explanations: 

1) We're wired to be sluts, and are very goal-oriented. Even if we aren't interested, someone of the opposite gender at least has the potential...

2) We're very averse to competition. Someone of the opposite gender is less likely to be compete with us. This could go two ways: we're afraid of the competitiveness we feel, or we're afraid of the competitiveness other people bring to relationships.

3) Easier to have the type of warm/near-relationship status friendships we enjoy with someone of the opposite gender, perhaps due to intense homophobia on the parts of our society. We can seldom enjoy ""Romantic friendships"" in this day and age, but friendships with people of the opposite gender can edge closer.

I wish I were kidding.

I can blend in for a few hours for a funeral or a nice dinner but in the end it becomes impossible to hold my tongue when faced with the mind-boggling contradictions and bizarre behaviors that people take collectively to be 'normal'.  

Many of the other INFJ's I know seem to share this aversion to normalcy.  We might like calm and quiet but the facade that constitutes 'average' behavior seems nothing short of sickening to our spirits should we expose ourselves to it for too long.

I dated one before for about a year, but I would imagine he was a particularly unbalanced one and I quickly wrote the type off as ""not for me"" without reading about them adequately or considering their functions much.

  Now, I'm at a point in my life when I am again seeking (not vigorously, but, you know, eyes open) a long-term partner. No expectations, of course, but I think ENFPs and INFJs have a great relationship dynamic anyway and I would like to meet more INFJs (particularly males, but it doesn't much matter, I enjoy all INFJs I know).

  So.  I live in a college town at a big state school so there are any sorts of ""crowds"" and people you can imagine.  I'd guess that INFJs are either keeping to themselves or hanging out with creative types, so that's the best idea I have on how to meet more of them.

I mean, I'm not going to go out and hunt down INFJs to try to date, but I realize that some of the most genuine and fulfilling relationships I've ever had (platonic or otherwise) were with INFJs... so I would like to meet more, seeing that I don't have many in my life now.  I understand you are introverts and like to keep to yourselves a decent amount, so I respect that, but when you *do* go out to places where you might meet new people... where do you like to go?

There have been a number of articles, including the 'Why INFJs and INFPs Have Such a Hard Time Taking Criticism' that equate 'helping' with 'people pleasing'.  

These two things are *very* different.  This may only sound semantic, but the difference is important.  

One is a sign of health.  The other is a sign of stress and emotional damage.  

The desire to help, for an INFJ, is totally natural.  It's built into our psychology to want to make the world around us a happier place.  We want people, even when facing conflict, to do it in a sane and rational way.  If our negotiating abilities can help with that then excellent.  We have fulfilled some portion of our purpose in life.

People pleasing is another creature.  People pleasing is attempting to diffuse conflict by any means necessary, up to and including, sacrificing oneself or one's emotional well-being to do it. It is the ultimate form of conflict avoidance and it is *very* unhealthy.  INFJs must face conflict now and then and do that, we have to make sure we have a healthy emotional base to do it from.  Constant stress will wear us down until we simply begin throwing ourselves away from any more pain of any kind.  

This tends to take the form of addictions and escapism.  I loathe this behavior, both in myself and in others, but it's tough to avoid unless you've got a good base-line stability established that you know you can retreat to once the conflict has been diffused.  

Helping is *positive*.  People pleasing is negative.  These two things shouldn't be equated.  Helping is a proactive, thinking business.  People pleasing is passive, automatic reaction.

Okay so my damn brain, as usual, won't shut off and I thought I'd reach out to my fellow INFJ's. I'm a writer and have been pursuing a career in TV. I've tried to work my way up from writers' assistant over the last few years and the stress of the job (try 12+ hour days and ten people talking to you at once all the time, but no one ever listening to you) has led to a lot of soul searching over the last year. I concluded I want to leave the industry and pursue my writing on my own without putting so much pressure on it to make money. Besides, I wanted to help people in a more tangible way, I wanted meaning to what I do to earn money (typical INFJ, right?). 

I've been doing some grant writing on a volunteer basis and really, really enjoy it. I'm pursuing getting a job in nonprofit but I am worried I won't be able to find one -- I'm applying a lot with no results.

Basically, I'm all over the place right now, as you can see. I hate the insecurity, I hate not having a plan, and I had pursued a singular goal since I was 14 (so for half my life), and now that's all changing. I think it NEEDS to change, I am happy about it changing, but the uncertainty is killing me! How can I be unsure of what to pursue next? This has never happened to me before! Oh, and did I mention I'm getting married in two months? (That, at least, is something I'm totally sure about. Yay!)

&gt; Do any of you INFJ's have a feeling or belief that everything is connected?

I do and probably more so than many others. 

Before I start to elaborate, I feel it's important to mention that what you're about to read might sometimes border on the religious (coming from an agnostic), but in this context - answering this question - it doesn't matter. Religions are stories people tell each other and (more importantly) themselves to cope with their everyday lives and at one point I figured: Why not choose my own narrative? Why not something that is based on science but includes the spiritual as well? This is what religion (and any other belief system) is all about and there's absolutely no doubt we humans (or most of us) are going to need a narrative like that for some time to come (which is why I wanted my narrative to be positive and rational).

Yes, I believe everything is connected and that we all are one. I'd go even further: If you believe in our current scientific world-view (big bang, theory of evolution and such), we already were all one at least once before. A long time ago, just moments before the big bang, we were all nothing but a blinding flash of light. One concentrated point of pure energy, seconds before this universe of ours was created by cosmic expansion. Only after the energy-density of the universe was low enough for matter to freely move around in space - allowing it to clump - could the galaxies, stars and planets form.

I think it's no coincidence that the dynamics of change &amp; progress as well as the structures of our universe, of our bodies, brains, of cells, bacteria and of the internet all share very similar patterns. We (in fact *everything* there is and isn't) are nothing more but energy in heightened states of physical harmony. 

So everything is connected. We humans are connected among each other via our subconsciousness and with the internet we are now starting to connect via a conscious, expressive link as well. Helping us to see and acknowledge problems, to solve them faster and to develop a more holistic world-view in the process. This holistic perspective in turn leads to us being able to focus our energies as a species towards solving problems on a global scale and doing it faster and more efficient with every day passing (which speaks to the exponential growth of not just life in general but also of the technology we create. We always use the newest technology to create the next one, nature does this too: It took around 900 million years to create life's building blocks, the DNA, but after that it only took 20 million years for it to spread around the earth's flora and fauna during a period referred to as the cambrian explosion).  

Most people aren’t able to comprehend today's developments in such a way that they could even begin to fathom their long-term implications. With an internet-capable smartphone, you’re in possesion of a communications device more powerful than anything we could possibly imagine just a few decades ago. It connects us to the emerging global brain. A shared information space where more than 1 billion people connect and share their knowledge, thoughts and ideas with each other. 

Smartphones put the entirety of information available on the internet at our fingertips. Wikipedia alone is an encyclopedia larger than anything there ever was (larger than the library of Alexandria) with hierarchies far flatter than anything that came before it. The monopoly on information and knowledge is crumbling before our eyes. Anyone can contribute, anyone can mutate information. This is the information revolution. This is YouTube, Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, you name it. We have transcended the old means of knowledge-transfer and information-sharing and are witnessing the birth of humanity’s expressive meta-consciousness.

We are somewhere at the very beginning of a long chain of causalities, nothing more but a short blink in the all-encompassing dynamic that is cosmic evolution itself. Still, we can already start to see (and anticipate) how technology will change the way we first understand and later shape our reality. Together, as a species.

Think about it: If we are the universe experiencing itself subjectively, then we are a creation of it just as our technology is a creation of ourselves, so there's really nothing unnatural about technology. Some even say that biological evolution ceased to be the main driving force of development after we humans entered the scene, introducing technological evolution as a species to the aforementioned process of cosmic evolution, where this energy we once all were is starting to gain consciousness. First through the individual, through us, and now it's the species' turn. Call it the 21. century enlightenment if you want but this is happening. 

I got a little off track but I think it's necessary to understand the above to really get a grasp of what it means that we're all one and interconnected. Why we should care more about each other (this includes *everyone* and *everything*) and why we should make the best of every day we have on this earth.
I don't believe in an afterlife. I'm pretty sure that once you're dead, that was it. For you - for this one individual among billions.

That's the beauty of my narrative: From the individual's perspective it encourages you to just go out into this world and live your life to the fullest - enjoy every second and regret no decision because it's your one and only life and it's yours to do with whatever you want. Your sole responsibility for having received this gift is to create the most positive and unique experience possible for you and everyone around you.  

On the other hand there's also the holistic perspective where I see this gradual development towards something truly whole (Pierre de Chardin talked about a concept like this in his Omega Point theory), with our descendants realizing the fullest potential of the cosmos as substrate independent minds. 

To this effect, maybe it's not that the universe was created by a god, but that the universe will lead to the emergence of something where the metaphor of god might apply. 

I myself would find it highly ironic if we should ever become these glorified gods we have fantasized about and subsequently subdued to for centuries. We even created them in our image. They are the products of our minds and only by freeing ourselves and taking full responsibility for our individual and holistic existence will we be able to leap to the next stage of (physical and intellectual) evolution. Which - seen in the grand scheme of things - I'm confident we someday will.  

Until then, I'm enjoying my ride.

I've heard it repeated by plenty of people and it really appalls me to think this is how a significant part of our society *thinks*.  

You can't change people.  

Bollocks.  You change people every day.  INFJs are better at it than anyone *else* mind you, but I'm sick of this.  I just ran across yet another of those 'things I learned in my 20s' type posts where one of the things the person had learned was 'You can't change people'.  I wanted to kick him in the head.  

I took a girl with Borderline Personality Disorder from an annual suicide attempt since she was eleven to living on her own, happily, completely devoid of suicidal and self-harming tendencies.  You know how?  I spent every day for six months with her telling her she was WORTH MY TIME.  Hard, right?  I changed her.  She's still screwed up, but she's *still alive* and happier than she's ever been now that she understands that somebody cares.  

Cowards think you can't change people.  Fools think you can't change people. 

People change themselves every day.  They're changed by their surroundings.  A person with enormous self-awareness can change the circumstances of everyone around them.  They can change themselves.  They can stop, for one bleeding moment, and take a second to say 'I don't like how this is.  I will *alter it*.'  I have changed the lives of dozens of people.  

A raped lesbian from Japan who lost her daughter to her insane parents who'd paid local boys *to rape her* then taken her child from her at birth by having her committed.  I helped her get her new girlfriend.  I pushed her through getting her daughter back, by being there, telling her it was *the right thing to do*. 

I changed her fucking life.  

A young transexual with her suicide *planned out* and a date set.  I dragged her out of her parent's home and into mine.  That was *six years ago*.  She's transitioned, gotten her pilots license, bought her own computer, paid her rent, and has money in the bank.   She's still my room-mate and my best friend.  

FUCK YOU if you think you can't change people.

Changing people is what we're here for.

I take other people's problems on as my own, but then sometimes, if I feel they are going in the complete wrong direction I almost feel like it's my duty to say something direct.   Even if it's hurtful. 

For example, I have a friend that has sex with random guys in the same house as her children who are 9-13 and aware of the situation.   I love her (as a friend for over 24 years) but...I just tell her how disgusted I am with her actions and how wrong it is to not be discrete around her kids.

I even coined a term ""it's not mean if it's true"" and I really believe that.  Some people need a wake up call in life and I feel an obligation to provide it.

Another example.  I have a friend and our sons are very close in age (around 12).  Well she doesn't want to spend the $8 to get him a haircut (because she rather spend it on smokes and beer), so she literally takes all the guards off a razor and shaves her kid down to the skin.  He's still in school.  Riding the bus.  My kid comes home very distraught about the situation.  Everyone is picking on this kid.  Calling him a cancer patient, or saying he must have had lice.

So, I approach the boy, ask him how he feels about his cut.  He is clearly VERY UPSET.  

So, I take mom on full force.  I tell her how bad the cut is and what has happened to him.  I offered to PAY to get his hair done myself if money was the issue.  

She tried to minimize it, but I told her that what she was doing was not right.  She poo-poo'ed it and I again stressed about what a big deal it was to her son, and basically I told her that if she took the clippers to him again, I was going to take the clippers to her and we would all just have a big clipper fight.  It worked though because she hasn't done a home job since.

Have been reading through a few posts and I really love the positive vibe and support in this subreddit. When I got my result I thought instantly that other INFJs would find comfort in each other's presence and that's what I've seen.

I'm actually nervous in that I'm thinking 'what if I'm not an INFJ' but it's weird because that alienation feeling is a characteristic being one it would seem. All of the advice and experiences shared that I've read  (just a little bit, so far!) just seem to be in line with my way of thinking. And I feel that it has more value and relevance because it's coming from people who want to understand and help.

My belief system values hard evidence over ambiguity typically, but something about the way test groups people together in personality types resonates with me. At times it feels like it may still fall under glorified horoscopes but it doesn't seem as vague. I'd say it's still in the making, and has a lot of value for what's understood so far, so that's okay because personality is a complex beast. 

Just had a few questions for you all. Kind of whacky but hopefully coherent. 

Do you ever feel like you are over-concerned with 'meta-problems?' Kind of like questioning the mechanism that would generate the problem in the first place. I enjoy the way I dress/look in that I feel it reflects the ""real me"" or whatever. But, then I worry that it could also reflect characteristics that aren't me and having the external world misunderstand my intentions in something as trivial as appearance stresses me out.

What are some of the positive belief systems that govern your outlook on the world?

Do you worry about the idea of a thing more than the thing itself to the point that they become two different things? (hope that makes sense)

I find I do this in relationships and just little nitpicky signs of human respect.


Anyway I'm sorry for super long text, but even if somehow I'm not INFJ, (but I feel the test is what you make of it, not a law to live by) I just felt at home and want to feel at home with people who are like-minded in some way, whatever it may be. I'm excited to see if we have drastically different beliefs that are generated from a shared underlying, unrealized belief system. Also, will update with hopefully good additional questions. I look forward to meaningful, spirited conversation to make anybody else, and myself feel respected, understood, valued, and connected.

Whenever i am at a restaurant or movie and see someone there by themselves it can ruin my pleasant mood for the rest of the day and I will sometimes remember that person for a long time.

A good example was about 5-6 years ago I was having Thanksgiving dinner at a restaurant.  Well there was this old man eating by himself.  I just wanted to run over there and invite him to join us so he wouldn't have to be alone.  Then the other side of my brain kicked in and thought well maybe he is alone for a reason. Maybe he is a psycho or maybe he just likes to eat by himself and it would be rude for me to bother him.  So I was distracted for the rest of the meal and could barely eat anything and felt guilty.

Sometimes if I go to movies with friends I will see some nerdy looking guy by himself if its a movie that would attract typical nerds.  I just want to go up and say hey I bet your a nice guy, I'll hang out with you and go to movies and play video games.  Again, then I think maybe he just likes watching movies by himself and I shouldn't assume he doesn't have friends.

Also, this issue really doesn't come up if i am at a fast food place or if the person is doing something else like reading.  I guess I just think oh these people are in a hurry or just want some alone time.

So since my friends think I am weird for this, I thought maybe it might just be extroverted feeling expressing itself and I wanted to see if I am alone on this.

I have a boyfriend that I have been dating for over 4 years. We are in our 20's. I love him, but his behavior confuses me a lot at times. I am an INTJ, he is an INFJ. I love him very, very much. I'm just curious if any of you 'get' or do or understand these things. 

- He is moody and negative to an extent that is unusual. If he gets into a funk it is extraordinarily hard to lift him out of. 
- He criticizes me a lot, especially when he is down, and he doesn't seem to get that this criticism is incredibly toxic, he doesn't seem to get why he shouldn't criticize me and wants to voice it rather than just letting it go; he views stuff quite dramatically a lot.
- Yet he can't take criticism, which can be frustrating because sometimes he asks me to critique his artwork even though it is stunning. If I say anything bad he becomes very ad and fixated on it until I take it back.
- He thinks he acts rationally, but he acts irrationally a lot when it comes to PEOPLE and you can't convince the poor boy otherwise. 
- He never feels good about himself. He hides this so well and acts so normal, but he is fixated on PEOPLE because he doesn't want to be fixated on himself. He doesn't like himself very much, he gets his self-esteem from people despite being a mini-celebrity for his amazing art and having lots of friends.
- He is bitter that his friends aren't as close to him as he is to them (but by normal standards, they are pretty damn close - he once delcared to me when upset that the world seemed 'heartless'). He has HIGH expectations of his friends. If they screw up/hurt him, he holds a secret grudge for a long time.
- Almost no one but me knows this. He doesn't tell anyone else these things. I've learned this be peeling back the layers of years and years of knowing him. 
- I know he becomes frustrated with me. He almost broke up with me because our relationship wasn't 'magical' enough. He seemed sort of floored that I woke up each day, thinking 'what can I do for him today' and that this made me love him more. He loves people deeply but he has such high expectations. When I left him after he practically ended it, he spiraled and did everything to get me back, I think he learned that he really, truly loved me but just didn't APPRECIATE me.
- I must be strong. Something very disturbing in my life happened and I started to have panic attacks. He looked after me for 3 days, and then he couldn't take the nurturing any longer. He can nurture other people much longer. But with me, he starts to melt-down if I am not strong. It has made me a much stronger person because I am the rock and I must be strong, not just to make my life better, but to be there for him too. 
- Forgives me but struggles to forgive everyone else; the grudges thing, but he doesn't hold grudges with me anywhere near as bad, he trusts me.

That is the thing. He loves people deeply and cares about them. But he also has unrealistic expectations and he doesn't appreciate them enough. I find this sad because if he did, he'd be a lot happier and feel less let down in life. 

He also doesn't love himself. If he loved himself, he'd find it easier to love others for who they are. When I am happy with my life, I find it easier to love others, and I've seen that happen to him too. When he is down - and it can happen a lot because he is moody - he sabotages his relationships and thinks there is a problem with them; but then when he TRULY loses them, like how he lost me, he realized he really did love them, and they were actually great, he just didn't appreciate them enough.

And its so strange, because I love people less but appreciate them more. 

In saying all of this I am madly in-love with him. For all of his faults (who doesn't have a truckload?!) he is deeply intelligent, caring, amazingly talented (can't emphasize that enough), has been through EVERYTHING with me, on everything that is important he is very accepting. I just find these things CONFUSING because, again, he wants relationships with people but he also seems to not like them much when he gets to know them, which I find CONFUSING! If this is INFJ behavior and any of you can relate, let me know, and if its not let me know too, thanks :)

**tl;dr: INFJ boyfriend loves others deeply but has unrealistic expectations. He holds grudges for a long time, and criticizes people a lot but can't take criticism at all. He doesn't realize this behavior is pretty unusual. Only shares this with me.

I'll start off by saying that I think this is more of a personal issue rather than an infj thing. I believe it may have to do with comfort levels.



My social circle is dominated by extroverts; if I had to guess, I would say about 90%. What's bugging me is that I feel like a really boring person and it bothers the living crap out of me. I look at my friends and they make it all seem so easy with making friends instantly, bringing life to the scene and being wanted to be around. It's not like I'm extremely awkward.. but there's this part of me that instinctively holds myself back. 




What's really bothering me is that I look at them, look at me and all I see is this boring person who isn't as wild, reckless and fun like my buddies. I get really self-conscious because i'm usually the quietest one around and I guess it makes me feel left out. I can socialize just fine but most of the things I say are straightforward and I find it hard to find something ""fun"" to talk about. I mostly enjoy abstract or serious topics. It's really taking it's toll on me, to the point where i've been starting to think that I won't find a lady who would be interested in me. I comfort myself by telling myself that I'll just go from women to women and I know that I will only look better since fitness is my hobby.


I feel like I should mention this but because my social group are mainly high school friends, I hold back the bigger part of me because of them knowing what kind of person I used to be, which was timid, extremely shy, self-conscious and lack of self-esteem. That was when I was 250 lbs, I am now 190. When I meet new people, I feel like I can spread my wings and show my current self.


I'm sorry if it seems like I'm just venting out to you guys. It's just that when I get like this, it usually stays until I get it off my chest. I do have a ""best friend"" whom I have the best conversations with but I have noticed that it is usually me calling her and wanting to talk and it's just bringing me down some more.. It's not like she doesn't want to talk to me because we will talk for hours but for some reason I just want to feel wanted..

I've felt very lost during this past year, and I've developed some self-destructive behaviors. Mainly drinking too much, and developing other unhealthy habits of excess as a way to escape. I tend to become so introspective that it doesn't do me much good, and I get so bogged down in worrying about the future and understanding the meaning of things, that I simply forget to just live in the moment. I also tend to become focused so much on helping my friends and other people solve their problems that I totally ignore my own. I just feel stuck. I don't feel hopeless about the world, I just don't understand where I fit into it. 

I'm finally seeing how unhappy I am, and I know that I need to take steps to change and make things better for myself. I haven't felt like myself in so long.

I suppose that heartwarming is the best word. Each of these videos made me tear up for different reasons. 

These 3 are about individuals who had the audacity to think they could be a something very few get to be. They've wanted this for so long and worked so hard to get to this opportunity. 

* [Lucy Spraggan - Tea And Toast - The X Factor UK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egBlPQpo6H4&amp;feature=share&amp;list=ULegBlPQpo6H4#t=0m46s) -  The song is sad but her reaction is what got me.
* [Budweiser Donkey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmmsr7PAhWU) - Completely fictional but once your floodgate is down, you cannot stop.
* [Rudy - Final Scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve_1DvNy5Vs) - Every man has shed a tear to this film's ending.

This one is about a little girl whom I surmise she would describe herself as ugly. In her young life she was probably teased and probably thought she would never be pretty. And then she met some funny people and that changed.

* [Operation Smile - Thalita](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nUkE1moT-g&amp;feature=fvhl) - You'll see what I mean @ 2:28

People sometimes forget that Legends were kids too. Tiger Wood's father Earl Woods, died of cancer on May 3, 2006. On Father's Day the next month, Nike played what is probably the most sentimental commercial portraying the lives Tiger and Earl shared.

* [Nike Fathers Day Commercial - Tiger and Earl Woods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUq-ttAcQxg) 

This last one is maybe a hit or miss with you. It's a japanese bullet-train commercial that involves quite a bit of people. It got to me due to the amount I love I felt watching those people waving. While I realize it's a commercial, it bring's me an uplifting feeling that community like that is still possible in my lifetime.

* [Heartwarming Japanese bullet-train commercial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UNbJzCFgjnU) - Songs pretty good too.

Anyway, I feel sort of refueled by experiencing both sides of the empathy coin. If you happen to have any videos along this line, I'd like to see them.

I have been described since childhood as “intense.” I’m a perfectionist and I constantly worry, about everything. I regularly replay conversations in my head and I feel that I have a much deeper inner life than anyone really realizes, even people who are close to me. I can spend hours by myself and I really value my privacy.  

I’m a student teacher in a one year long Master’s program. I student teach with two cooperating teachers (a weird, but okay situation). They are supposed to mentor and guide me and I teach one class in each of their classrooms. I also have a supervisor who observes me teach once every two weeks and acts as a liaison between the university and what I’m doing at my school site. 

Apparently, one of my teachers and my supervisor seem to see me as prickly and unfriendly. My supervisor brought up an instance where I seemed bored in one of my Master’s classes and also told me (in an incredibly painful, awful meeting that she INSISTED ON) that I come across as “arrogant” and that I act like I’m “above it all.” (Why she thinks that would be a good way to communicate is really unclear to me.) She even brought up my body language. My cooperating teacher brought up some instance where someone had said hello to me in the hall and I ignored (translation: probably didn’t see them) them as evidence of my unfriendliness. 

I have worked really hard to make myself seem accessible and friendly to students, but apparently other people just aren’t getting it. It’s so frustrating to feel like certain people don’t get me when everyone else seems to handle it fine and my actual teaching is consistently rated well. I keep thinking that this is so tangential to my actual work. 

What can I do to make myself seem more open? I don’t walk around smiling (and actually think it’s kind of weird) but I’m always pleasant, if a little reserved, when people talk to me. Part of me wants to tell everyone to fuck off and give me some time to warm up to them (it always happens eventually), but because I’m being constantly evaluated, that’s not really an option either. 

**tl;dr Help me seem nicer.**

I've been dealing with some overwhelming guilt for the past week. Without going into excessive detail, I did some things that badly emotionally hurt a very close friend, and caused a third party person who I've never met to be hurt to a lesser extent as well. I feel like I should have known better than to do what I did, and I'm ashamed. I'm remaining friends with this person that I've hurt, and we talk daily, and that almost makes it worse. There's nothing I can do to change what I've done or make this person feel better. This person (an ENTP) claims to bounce back and forgive quickly and that losing my friendship would be much worse than what I've done. But there's this overwhelming shame and guilt that's haunting me. Whenever I'm alone in a room I go back to my thoughts and I begin to cry. I've apologized a thousand times, and my words just seem hollow. Plus if these things were done to me I would just want to be left alone, and my victim won't let me disappear. 

I've been medicated for chronic clinical depression for 10 years, and I can honestly say guilt could give untreated depression a serious run for its money in terms of the absolute worst thing I have ever felt. I do still see a therapist every other week but talking to her didn't help much on this issue (my life this past year has been pretty hard, I can't believe I just went out and piled more shit on top of myself).

Fellow INFJs, do you have any words of wisdom on how you've forgiven yourself for something horrible you've done?

The moments when I was a kid and could let my mind melt into the subconsciousness of the universe (sorry for the dramatic wording, it's very hard to describe but that's kinda what I felt and I've been trying, and succeeding, in getting that feeling back once in a while), and death? I don't know, I just think about it a lot these days, mankind is such a freakish coincidence, is this all there is? 

I'm not religious, but I do feel like there's something more. I just wanted to know, specially from you who posted in the thread, have you explored this matter further? Is this hyperawareness a ""thing"" or just our brains short-circuiting? Does it have a name? I'd like to read more.

I know this whole post sounds a little vague, I hope some of you know what I'm talking about :)

For me, my biggest complaint is that I often get kidded about being really honest and big hearted.  People give me the impression that they think being so honest and kind is a liability.  I even remember my grandfather shaking his head once and saying 'ahh, big hearted 44441' and the scenario was that my kindness was causing frustration for me at that point in my life.  

Anyway, here is a real life situation, and i wonder if others get into this.  

My wife and sister and I are going to a concert tomorrow.  My father remarried 6 years ago to a woman 20 years his junior, so my step sister is actually 22 years younger than me.  She is 18.  She failed one class in her senior year, so she could not graduate.  Somehow the school had an outside person come in and look at the class she failed, as a bunch of people failed it.  They said most of the failures were passing grades, so in August, she found out she graduated.  No graduatiion ceremony, no grad party.  

So she decides to have one in september - the day of our concert.  no worries, the concert is later, we will come early.  The concert is at a big amusement park.  My wife was bummed because for some reason the park itself would be closed tomorrow, so no chance to go on rides before the concert.  

Now, just last night, my wife gets an email from the park: they will be open 4 hours before the concert (only the roller coasters, nothing else), and have food available.  She and my sister want to go.  My wife tells my sister, ""well I would like to skip the party too, but you know how 44441 is, Ill have to see what he thinks"".  

I actually dont care about amusement parks, and it bugs me that I don't like them.  Rides just freak me out for some reason.  I never feel exhilarated, just worried the ride will break.  This is not the most manly character feature to have, apparently this sensitivity is related to empathy?  And is an INFJ trait?  

Sooo... my relationship with my dad has been strained over the years, and i have missed a bunch of my step sisters' birthdays when she was younger.  I feel it would be really bad to skip her party just to go on amusement rides, if not for her, but to show my dad and his wife we care.  My sister says 'well its her fault she had a party in september and not when most people have it'  except... it wasn't truly her fault, other than doing bad in class.  My wife rides the fence, and claims to be in the middle, but I know if she werent sure I want to take the high road, she would agree with my sister.  She pointed out that if the park had been open, we would have gone to the park anyway, but my argument is that we already committed to going to the graduation party.

And... I try to look hard at my own thoughts, and wonder ""am I just against going to the park because I dont care about rides?  If it were something i really wanted to go to (even the concert is really a band my wife likes, not me) would i also skip the party?""

So here is what bugs me about being an INFJ: why is it so hard for other people to 'take the high road' and do the right thing?  And why do I always get to be the LONE voice that says 'do the right thing'?  And.. it also seems most people don't seem to take honest looks at their own actions, and what have I gotten for it over the years?  Scorn.  People think when I question myself that I am not confident.  

So ultimately I have worked hard all my life to be a good person and take the high road, and to be honest about myself and admit my own flaws, AND look for them... and all i get is derision.  

Any other INFJs out there feel this way?  I often see people here talking about what bugs them about being an INFJ, but sometimes it is hard to know if the issues are the same, so I thought a concrete example showing exactly what (maybe) the cause of INFJ frustrations are might be interesting for people to read.

First, thank you for taking the time to comment, or even just to read this. 

As has been said here before, INFJs have some trouble liking/loving themselves. Personally, this problem very often keeps me from creative writing, something I hope to eventually pursue as a career. Whenever I get the urge to start on or continue a certain project, I knock myself down with these ideas that no matter what I write, it will never be as good as I want it to be. 

Long story short, I end up spending my free time on the internet (in unproductive capacities), sleeping, or just sitting around. I know that none of these are inherently ""bad"", but when they consume hours of my day, I'm left with a worthless and agitated feeling. 

Any similar experiences out there? And if so, have you found any ways to cut down on this inner conflict? I once tried making daily schedules which included a certain amount of time for writing projects, but then I discovered that I hate having to always keep to a schedule.

I always went with my gut, and I am very capable of sensing how other people may feel in a situation. I utilized this quite frequently not too long ago.

So yesterday, I went to a high school party. I'm not one for drinking or smoking, so I just steered clear of that. I brought three friends. I don't go to the same high school as my three friends. This party was hosted by one of my classmates, one that my friends didn't know. I wanted them to interact and meet people and just keep me company.

As the night progressed, some guys, who neither I nor my friends knew, approached one of my friends. She is definitely the most spunky with a lively personality. I tried to give off the same vibe, to meet new people and have as great time as she was having, but no one came up to me.

My other friend that was not approached gave off the ""I'm not available"" vibe, because she is in a relationship. I just couldn't get the ""I want to meet new people! I'm friendly, I promise. I'm not desperate!"" vibe across.

-I do sound desperate. That's just because it is so easy to read people, and some get intimidated by that. It's hard to make friends that way.

Once again, while everyone had a decent time, I just wanted to go home. My last friend (she's not last she just has not been mentioned yet) is also an INFJ and we discussed why we just could not get the right vibe out. We did not look mad or bitchy. We just wanted to have fun like everyone else.

The worst part was taking care of a drunk girl the rest of the night. I guess that's the vibe I give off. ""I'll take care of that"". I'm glad that's the reputation I have though.

Everyone deals with death differently, and I dont know too many INFJs to talk about it with. In the past 6 months I have had some people that were fairly close to me pass on. Even before that, the reaction was always the same. 

When my grandparents passed I wasn't sad until I saw my family that way. I lost both of them within 36 hours. I didnt ever cry, but I felt like I was going to when the bagpipes were played and when I saw my father crying. The only other time I saw him cry was when his dog died. 

This past year my last grandmother passed. She was 92 and ready to go. I also got to talk with her and was there when she passed. I wasnt upset with that either, but understandably so. The woman lived a full life and had the opportunity to welcome death. I was more upset that the nurses started to change her bedpan in front of me. He mind was sharp and she was very much awake. She didnt like me seeing her on oxygen and it pissed me off so bad that they didnt care to respect her. She didnt want music played at her funeral or anything and it was rainy outside. It was sad for sure, but most of the time was spent laughing and talking with old family. The saddest part is that our family will no longer be tied together because the last anchor is gone. 

Month or so after that, my friend sends me a single &lt;3 on facebook. I thought he was just goofing off like always. The next morning I find out that he had hung himself. He was a car guy and we all would meet up and work on whatever. I was upset but not as upset and broken as I thought I should be. Driving to the funeral it hit me and I wanted to turn around because I could feel a break down coming on. I told myself I couldnt do that and that I would go break down somewhere private, but I couldnt. So I pushed my feelings down and was determined to be strong for the other guys. 

Push forward to last Thursday. My mother calls me while Im at work and says shes out in front of my house. She says she has bad news but I probably already know. Immediate anxiety attack. I had no idea what was wrong , but it must be something bad if shes at my house. She was there waiting to find out if she should pick me up from work. A girl I dated for 2 1/2 years and had been friends with was killed. She had lived in the house where I do now (long story but I pretty well did too much to help her out). 
She was in an argument about leaving her fiance. She was 11 weeks pregnant with his baby and from what I know he got mad and shot her, then himself. She has a 3 year old who now has no mother. When I got that news it was instant sorrow and it got worse as I tried to drive. I had to flip my mirror up so I couldnt see my pathetic self start to cry. 

I still held down my feelings. I wasnt going to lose it in front of mom and I couldnt on the side of the road because it would take too long. I tried to go inside and let it out but the feelings had passed. 

This always happens. I can only remember two occasions where I lost my shit. Both were because of girls and one was in front of a girl. 


Anyway, I dont understand why I have to hold it in or if this is normal. Other than when I am around people or when I dwell on it, the things dont bother me up front. I know they do take a toll subconsciously. I understand death and so it doesnt bother me mentally too much. Its more the ""I was talking to them just yesterday, and now they are in a box and I cant do that anymore"" that shocks me. I cant go out cruising with my friend anymore.

New to the community as I've only just realised my personality type is, in fact, INFJ, but I've been in a multitude of situations where something unexpected has come up and I feel as if I find myself in being unable to think about anything else.

It's been frustrating in a number of ways, most recently in a discussion with someone I'm currently dating. I apologised over the phone the following day (she was packing to go stay with her parents for the week) and she seemed OK with my response, in as much as she's agreed to meet up again.

However, I'm concerned that it could blow up again down the line, given we're still kinda in the honeymoon period of the dating phase and there is a lot to discuss.

Any ideas that could help me stay calm and out of that loop?

1370232394.0,13,self.infj,1fk7u1,I've been listening to Brene Brown's *The Power of Vulnerability* audiobook and summarizing the book's key ideas for better understanding of the content. This applies to everyone but I figured INFJ's benefit the most from it.,NotThatRG3,14,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1fk7u1/ive_been_listening_to_brene_browns_the_power_of/,"The book opens with this [talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCvmsMzlF7o) and leads into a talk she does at a national conference in front of a audience of colleagues. Her [audiobook](http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_5?asin=B00CYKDYBQ&amp;qid=1370226808&amp;sr=1-5) is a more of talk in front of a crowd and not actually a book.

**Key Points**:

* **Embarrassment** - Embarrassment is doing something stupid which others have also probably done. Embarrassment is fleeting, funny, and may make for good stories.

* **Shame** vs *Guilt* - **Shame** is individualized to the person. What is **shaming** for me, may bring up *guilt* in one person, embarrassment in another person, and not even register to another person.**Shame** is a focus on self. *Guilt* is a focus on behavior. Come into work hungover, 1 hr late, and missing an important client, and you'll feel **shame**. Come into work hungover, but still manage to see the important client, and you'll feel *guilt*. **Shame** is negative as it focuses on the self. *Guilt* is positive as it focuses on the behavior. *Guilt*: I'm sorry I made a mistake. **Shame**: I am sorry I am a mistake. *Guilt* is productive and useful. **Shame** is useless and **dangerous**. ***A addict needs shame like a man dying of thirst needs salt water***.

* **Humiliation** is shame that does not feel deserved. *Some student forgets to write her name on her paper in a 4th grade math class. The teacher decides to make an example of her. 'Let me help you out by writing your name on the paper, Susie! S-T-U-P-I-D! There you go, Susie!!!'*  If Susie's self talk is *'That teacher is horrible! I didn't deserve that!'* that's humiliation and will be heard about and eventually handled. If Susie's self talk is *'I'm so stupid! Why did I do that?'* that's shame that **will not be heard** about, and be carried with her all of her life.

* **Handling Shame** - Shame is like a gremlin. It dies when it's exposed to light. Shame is also like a dementor as it will suck all the life out of you. Shame has 2 phrases it repeats: 'You're never good enough.' 'Who do you think you are?' Say you're hearing these 2 phrases over and over in your head while you're trying to work and keep second guessing yourself. The minute you call a friend and admit to them what sort of gremlins are bothering you, they immediately shrink down to 80% of their original size. If it's met by Empathy and not empty praise, then the gremlins disappear. Shame needs only 3 things to grow exponentially. Secrecy, Silence, and Judgement. It will creep to each corner of your life.  Empathy will make the environment hostile to shame and prevent it from growing and spreading.

* **Empathy** - **Empathy is the ability to see the world as others see it.** Known as perspective-taking or critical awareness.
**Empathy is to be non-judgmental**. People always judge in areas in which we are most susceptible to shame and always pick people who are doing worse than they are in that category. This is done to feel better. **Empathy is to understand another's feelings and to convey your understanding of those feelings**. Look people in the eye when they tell you something shameful. The best response is 'me too.' **Empathy is a skill**. Empathy can only be improved by offering it to and receiving it from others. Sympathy is seeing someone is in a hole and offering condolences. Empathy is jumping in the darkness of the hole and helping that person out. While sympathy worsens feelings of shame, empathy provides an inverse effect on feelings of shame.

**Myths about Vulnerability**

* **Vulnerability is weakness.** Surveyed examples of what people claimed was vulnerability: Asking for help. Saying I don't know. Sitting with my wife who has stage 4 breast cancer to make decisions about our kids' future. Calling a good friend whose child died in a car accident. Loving someone who struggles with addiction. Getting promoted when being unsure of worthiness of it. Getting fired. Initiating sex with a spouse. Sending your child to school knowing they're struggling but letting them do their 'thing'. Taking responsibility for a mistake. It's the courage to empathize and be present with someone in a horrible situation.

* **Vulnerability is something I don't do.** Often times people give excuses as to why they don't deal with vulnerability. I'm a; man, lawyer, engineer, etc. Vulnerability is defined as uncertainty, risk, and emotional exposure. Everyone does vulnerability every single day. If you have someone you love, can you control whether or not they'll love you back? Their personal safety? Their health? Vulnerability can be ignored or embraced, but never removed.
Life cannot be lived without vulnerability.

* **I can do this alone.** Not asking for help as seen as a huge strength in our society. Being vulnerable takes much more courage than to isolate or hide ourselves. Most people shut down parts of themselves after dealing with the pain of shame in not being themselves. Ex: I'd like to quit football and join theater but dad won't like it. I want to quit cheer and join the Klingon club but mom won't like it. Later on in middle age it's much more difficult to reactivate these parts. 

* **The trust required to be truly vulnerability is easy to obtain.** Trust requires a number of gestures, large and small. Trust is like a piggy bank. Every time you share a little piece of yourself with someone and they keep it a secret, you put a coin in the jar. If they share it, you take out a coin. The fuller it get's the more you trust and can trust that person. The more empty it gets the less you can trust them. 

**Betrayal of vulnerability**

* **Betrayal of vulnerability with someone and they use that vulnerability against them.** Having a secret shared. Having been cheated on by a loved one. Blaming. Judging. and Shaming

* **Disengagement from loved ones.** When people stop being vulnerable and fully engaged with each other. Texting or watching TV during a conversations involving emotions. Ignoring a loved one's emotions or needs outright.

1365457913.0,13,self.infj,1by2b0,DAE struggle with the ability to receive comfort?,NoravAlis,16,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1by2b0/dae_struggle_with_the_ability_to_receive_comfort/,"Hello.  First I want to say, sorry for the wall of text.  I appreciate anyone willing to bear with me here.

I'm the oldest of three siblings, and my younger sisters always have and still do need a lot of parental attention for various psychological issues (OCD for one, ADHD and compulsiveness for the other.)  Our primary parental influence was our mom, who is very much a ""tough-love"" kind of person, (her father was a retired army general, and she was raised much the same way.) Her natural inclination is to encourage and favor strength and self-discipline, rather than warmth and comfort, and I take after her a lot in the sense that we both see ourselves as highly responsible people, and are both a bit awkward with comforting others.  Instead, we are more inclined to see stress-related behavior as symptomatic of problems that require logical analysis, and perseverance to resolve.)  

As an adult with a job that regularly becomes quite stressful (I work as an analyst in a call center environment,) I find that I've become very efficient at internalizing stress.  Logically, I realize this approach is unsustainable, and today I had my first panic attack in years due to the stress building up in several areas of my life (work, family, a recently-developed biomechanical imbalance issue with my hips causing a low-level but constant pain in my lower back and hips.)  

My experience of having a panic attack is interesting because as it is happening, it almost feels as if my perspective is tunneling deeper and further into my own mind until I'm so overwhelmed by the experience of anxiety, and so preoccupied with circular thinking and logically trying to resolve the issues, that I forget to breath.  It usually takes until I'm literally hyperventilating before I recognize the physical truth that I'm having an attack.  In that moment, my mind switches from this super introverted, hyperactive panic mode, to an acute state of calm, self-awareness where the presence of other people (even those I am close to and trust, such as my boyfriend,) causes a deep sense of shame and humiliation.  This only aggravates the physical symptoms of the attack until I can physically escape to a dark place where I can be alone to let my sympathetic nervous system take over motor control, allowing my body to self-comfort (e.g. rocking or shaking.)  I know I've always been very ""sensitive"" to the external world, and am easily over-stimulated, even in a state of relative relaxation.  

This has always been my MO, and it needs to change.  We were driving home from the office to have lunch today when I had an attack, and my wonderful boyfriend did everything he could think of to try and comfort me, but to my horror, my inclination to push him away took over.  Honestly, I have an intense discomfort with being comforted.  He is also an introvert, and cares for me deeply, and it broke my heart when he admitted that it hurt him to have me push him away, emotionally and physically.  I think my way of dealing with stress has carried over from childhood, and is simply, not to deal with it at all, but to internalize it and pretend it's not there until I can retreat to the safety of solitude, where I can regain composure in private.  My process has always been to hide the internal workings of stress and anxiety behind a smile and a positive outlook (I do tend to be a positive person in general, it's just that the cognitive dissonance becomes almost physically painful to maintain when stressful events or stimuli start to build up.)

So, in staying true to my own demons, which are very uncomfortable with the concept of comfort, I'd love to hear from anyone who can relate, or offer practical advice for dealing with stress in a productive, non-destructive way.  I'm going to call my health care provider tonight and see about making an appointment with a therapist who can help me develop some tools for dealing with stress in a healthy way, because today I think I realized that the loneliness and shame are killing me.

The comment:

http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/16e89y/famous_infjs/c7vg1w2

My response:

Most of this response is a personal philosophy but I hope it can give some insight into an INFJs mind and if not and INFJs mind then at least my own mind and I hope it has some effect on you all. Whether it's to agree with me or to disagree and try to not be me, all of which contributing to your personal view no matter how you look at it ;)

I'd think, as an INFJ, most of us here could identify with this feeling and understand it as a natural feeling in anybody. I feel relatively safe saying that. Although personally most of my true feelings are thought to be over the top but I would fight to my dying breath that I am, and probably most of you are, just strongly in tune with what we (humans) truly want as ""an individual versus the universe"" and have the ability to separate it from what would be considered ""normal"" attitudes as to avoid brow raising. Erasing our problems from existence would be ideal in any persons eyes but the majority of the population ""buries"" these emotions because it is only one step away from going on a killing spree most people would say. We all have the thoughts but we don't act on them. I embrace these feelings and I assume it's an INFJ thing. Either that or I'm a psychopath in the making or maybe it's normal and I'm high on my self/personality. In any case, I've never done anything like that and have no intention of doing so in the future outside of self defense in regards to killing. The fact that we embrace these feelings is what makes us able to ""read"" people so well. We know what we truly want as human beings so we can easily identify what others want especially when they try to cover it up, as that is sometimes our specialty. We hunger and envy. We want to fuck, eat, laze and feed our ego. We want to amass happiness and obliterate anything we disagree with. Some have better control of these than others, but control isn't the factor. Our closeness to these feelings is the factor and sometimes it's scary realizing that you literally could do ANYTHING you wanted in an instant by just taking it, as far as killing and most material goes that isn't under guard by fifty armed men. 

When it comes to ""If I ruled the world"" type of situation, you're not the only one with those feelings I believe. If one person got control, they would do what's within their power to eliminate what they believe plagues the earth in what manner they see fit. It's going to be the same story no matter who leads it. And since power is the topic, I think it's safe to say that immortality is of relevance in a reasonable manner such as no one objectifying you. No one trying to stop you when you say something is to be done. I guess, having an army to act on your will is a good way to put it.

Our time on this earth in a state of equilibrium and lack of power has humbled most of us. We see what it's like to be at the bottom and then at the top and back and forth your entire life. Pain and happiness we've experienced has bestowed empathy, caring for the downtrodden as well as hatred for those we deem ""behind"" in the life experience meter which usually consists of arrogance, ignorance, and luck. That empathy is what would stop some of us from obliterating things we disagree which that I mentioned earlier. Some of us feel that it doesn't have to be removed from existence and would actually ""better"" us if it were around and we learned to deal with it. My personal philosophy is that it doesn't matter what we obliterate or exalt. We are always in equilibrium. When one thing is is attained we are on the hunt for the next best thing. When one fear is buried, the next one rears its head. You may call it a type of fate. But 99% of the time, words fall short of meaning. It is more than fate if you ask me. I hope this helps in any manner.

I took the MBTI test, and for some reason this time I took it seriously. Finally decided to write this out with the hope that someone will be able to answer a question or two.

I feel like my interactions with other people are *always* contrived. In other words, I fake my own emotions and opinions in order to 1. gain acceptance, and 2. escape any rejection I'd take to heart - I won't reveal what I actually think out of fear that I'll be exposing myself. 


Probably because of this, even the classmates that I've hung out with since elementary school are no more than acquaintances (that I feel obligated to stick with). I've never had a best friend. There's never been anyone I've felt comfortable enough to open up to. I'm just there because I want to create the illusion that I'm not a complete outsider.

[this comment that I posted summarizes my experience pretty well](http://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/15f7q7/ive_started_to_realise_that_i_dont_actually_like/c7m010p?context=3)

My friends aren't bad people. I just wouldn't ever tell them anything. I went through a three or four year long family crisis and never even hinted at its existence. Anyway, about a year and a half ago I finally found the connection I'd needed for so long, and it was through the internet. I gave everything to this online friendship, and I don't think that's an exaggeration. In return, this guy convinced me to believe that I'm creative and intelligent and capable and deserve attention (kinda worked), and I discovered myself that I have considerably less trouble expressing myself through writing. He was also someone I was able to help. It's not true, but I feel like I've gone through almost every possible emotion because of him. We still talk.

Now, I'm in a confusing relationship with a boy who it's a struggle to have a meaningful conversation with. This is the first relationship I've had, and I have no idea how it happened so easily. The thing is, I liked him because he seemed genuine. Then he held my hand ! so there wasn't really anything I could do to prevent myself from falling for him, at least initially. But I'm a terrible conversationalist anyway, and although I don't feel particularly uncomfortable around him, there's absolutely nothing for us to talk about. It's just weird. There's nothing except physical attraction, but even that's dwindling because it's stupid if that's all that exists. I sense that he doesn't even have stuff that he wants to say, and neither do I.  It's a disappointment. No idea whether or not it's worth it to keep trying.

Everyone! I'm also an interesting person! I have a deep appreciation for art and I take advantage of that by creating it myself. I'm not hesitant to say that I have at least some degree of talent. I'm constantly amazed by the world around me. I have the *ability* to have great conversations and be spontaneous and sarcastic and fun, although so far I've almost exclusively been able to show that side of myself to my younger sister. 

* When I try to be at all introspective, people react to what I'm saying as if I'm speaking a different language.

* I like to think that I have the ability to fully comprehend? absorb? appreciate? the embodiment of a piece of art. I can 'be the artist' and understand exactly what they were doing. That being said, some things just don't work for me.
 
* I think I have a good sense of balance and organization, but I can't really explain it. 

* I only approach people I feel superior to. Don't get the wrong impression, though - I'm drawn to people who feel uncomfortable or need help, although I normally don't do much to help them. I also just really enjoy working with children.

* Since I was young, adults have told me that I'm ""the calm of the storm"". 

* Nature, school, lists, procrastination, perceived control, ambiguous gestures that actually mean a whole lot

* I'd like to think that I'm above being awkward. 

* I'm still not good enough. 

* I have a lot of trouble watching movies or television shows, so I rarely do. 

* On-and-off nervous habits, some harmful and potentially connected to causes apart from my personality

* I used to be (in my opinion) debilitatingly shy. Then when I started high school, I also had anxiety so bad that .. I could function even less. It literally immobilized me, and to add to that, my self confidence was so low that I felt bad for people who even had to look at me. I keep all of this to myself. Working through it is an ongoing process but I've definitely improved.

* I still get really, really stressed out about social functions of any sort. No further details needed, right? You know what I'm talking about.

* Also since I was young, I don't contribute to conversations. I listen and pretend I'm engaged through physical cues. I would never express my opinion, so it got to a point where I didn't feel like I had one. For a while, I only agreed with other people and acted like his or her point of view was coincidentally also my own. 

* I affectionately refer to the method of everyday interaction with people, i.e. small talk, as ""the art of conversation"". Ew.

* I hate being late, but I always am in order to avoid being the only one there. Intense guilt reliably precedes and results.

* I can't help but defend universities, pedophiles, and other beings typically characterized as evil.  There's also playing the devil's advocate, but that's different.

* I collect things. For that reason, I LOVE my room, although I wish I could escape the endless cycle of entropy that it's fallen into. 

* I cannot tell a lie when confronted directly. My failure to tell a good lie can be ignored. I can hide things. But even when I'm not lying people think I'm lying, which can get complicated.

* People never expect me to joke, so when I do, it isn't received well. 

* I'm patient.

* I like you.

* I probably think you're mostly nice.

My main goal in telling you all of this is to be understood. So if you do, please check 'yes' in the box below. Of course there are a million more details I have the urge to've included, but for now I'll let it go. :) I need a forum to let all of this out, so I sincerely apologize if a subreddit about people's personalities is an inappropriate place. On the other hand, this shouldn't be too hard to just ignore. I'm glad you guys are here, you've already helped me. 

My problem is that I don't know. I can handle anything, but what are my limits? What should I pursue? What would make me happy? Is anything wrong with me? The future puts me off and I absolutely hate to think about it, so I don't. Is that normal? Any insight?

Your stories will help!,Chessiecat,19,6,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/143dcv/infj_love_is_so_wild_and_i_want_to_keep_my_head/,"Alright, here we go.  I've recently entered a relationship with another INFJ.  Not a traditional relationship mind you.  We're both poly.  He has several friends and partners.  I have a few of my own.  

Our personalities mesh in some frightening ways.  This is a cerebral experience the like of which I have never had before, even in relationships where I was ostensibly 'in love'.  I tend to love deeply but without great bursts of emotion.  Showing too much emotion makes me incredibly uncomfortable though I imagine most of you will know the unpleasant sensation of being around someone who spills their feelings everywhere willynilly.  This person has flown in way under my radar.  I am emotionally attached.  I am /in/ love.  

Keep in mind, I have had my fair chunk of lovers and friends I was close to.  I've had 'decent' sex before.  I've had emotional connections that worked 'alright'.  Nothing in my life prepared me for what's going on right now.  He and I are CLOSE.  The sex is sloppy and clumsy and messy...and beyond belief.  It's the best I've ever had, up to and including the lovemaking with people who were professionals (One of my lovers is a dominatrix who is roughly twice my age.  No, I'm not paying for sex.  We're just FWBs.  Yes, we've had our STD tests.)

There's something in the American idea of love that says if you love intensely then you will love very briefly.  I really don't want that to happen with him.  

He has freedom with me, sexually and emotionally, to love who he wants to.  He must be safe with himself but he's pretty safe on principle.  I... /trust/ him.  Most INFJs will know what that means.  We usually only trust people so far as our intuition tells us we can and not one iota more.  Most people are only trustworthy until you give them a nudge from the wrong direction.  I don't own him and I would never want to.  That's part of the beauty of it.  Mutualism.  We've got honest to goodness mutualism.  


I realize a part of why this feels so intense is new relationship energies but I've had those before. They were nice but... NEVER this wild or powerful.  I want sanity.  I want independence.  I want freedom.  I have all of that with him and still, I have these intense feelings.  I don't want to poison this congress with those.

You want to do good deeds for the sake of them being good deeds, not because it makes you feel good to do good... If that makes sense. 

I get this feeling of guilt if I catch myself thinking later that ""I think it was nice to help that old lady with her groceries"" or whatever the action was.

(WARNING: LONG POST)",cheatingINFJ,14,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/y4vti/i_want_to_share_a_story_i_cheated_multiple_times/,"I wanted to get this off my chest, and at the same time, give a reminder that we are completely susceptible to doing things we know are wrong.

Some background is required for me to really begin. I was a loner in high school. I was the weird girl that always doodled dragons in class. I had almost no friends except for my boyfriend at the time (who was my best friend beforehand). He was the only person that had ever given me any romantic attention, and at the time, I believed he was the one. I thought in my idealism that we would get married someday.

My boyfriend (let's call him Sam) had a terrible case of depression. We had been dating for 2 years, and right after we started college, he broke up with me (he didn't want to drag me down with his depressive state). I was utterly, completely devastated. In my emotional instability, I desperately tried making new friends at college, joining clubs, *trying* to get my mind off Sam.

One of the first people I met at college was a guy I'll call Alan. Alan was one of those charismatic, touchy-feely people who just *loved* connecting with others. I quickly made friends with him and we started to bond at an extremely fast pace. He was the person whose shoulder I cried on. I told him all about my pain over Sam, about myself, everything. I was desperate for someone to listen to me, and it seemed like he was the perfect person to just pour myself out to. I wanted to date him, but it seemed at the time that he wasn't yet ready for a romantic relationship.

In one of my classes, I met someone else - I'll call him Rick. He was laid-back, easy to talk to... We connected very fast. We sat next to each other in class every day. Eventually, Rick asked me to come over to his place and hang out. After that, we went on a date and...he kissed me. Now, both of us established that we were *not* looking for anything serious yet. I liked him, certainly, but part of my desire to date him was due to wanting a rebound. He, too, had just been dumped, so it seemed to work out for us both.

We did not expect to fall in love after just 2 months of seeing each other. He told me he loved me, and sparks flew.

...And then Sam found out about my new relationship. This is where things get messy...

He wanted to meet up with me and talk, and I stupidly agreed. Now...my feelings for Sam had not disappeared. We had a lot of history together, and being as close to him as I was, it was extremely difficult for me to just throw our relationship away. He admitted that he still had feelings for me and that he wanted to try again. He was taking depression medication and was getting back on the right track. After all we'd been through together, I wanted to go back to him.

The problem was that my feelings were divided. I cared for Rick, too. I cared for him *a lot,* even though we hadn't been together as long. It made me feel extremely guilty to do so, but I broke up with him and explained why. It was a horrible, horrible breakup. We were both in tears. He was utterly devastated...because he found love after being dumped, and then I just took it away.

I continued talking to Alan about my life, what was going on...and he kept listening. He continued to be a good friend to me throughout the drama.

So I settled into an uneasy relationship back with Sam. We were together, but it wasn't the same. College had opened my eyes to so many new possibilities. Suddenly, I was making friends. Suddenly, I was getting *attention* that I had barely received before, and I craved more of it.

I still also talked to Rick occasionally. He still had feelings for me, and I for him (and he knew it, even though I tried to hide it).

On the last day of college, I hung out with Alan one last time before he had to go home many miles away. We were already extremely close emotionally. Before I left, he impulsively kissed me. Now, things were getting really bad...

I found myself really wanting to date him. To have ""fun."" To receive MORE attention from ANOTHER guy who was willing to connect to me, making me forget my insecurities. Alan and I chatted online and it was definitely implied that we would be getting together when we went back to school... I realized that I had to break it off with Sam if I wanted to do this. So...I told Sam one day that I wanted to ""explore."" That I wanted to try dating other guys, and - worst of all - *that I'd come back to him eventually.* This...was incredibly damaging, as you can imagine.

Well, I started dating Alan as soon as we went back to school. It was nothing serious. A ""fun"" thing, as I wanted...

But, my feelings for Sam still hadn't disappeared. So, guess what happened? We met up. And made out. Once again, I cheated.

So...this is the part where I start to feel extremely guilty about all this *shit* I've been pulling. I had been cheating, hurting people for the sake of getting attention from others. Well...I hung out with Rick one day. I tearfully told him *everything.* I told him about how I'd been cheating, how fucked up I was.

I don't fucking know why or how, but he still cared for me after all I told him. He didn't push me away. I expected him to be completely disgusted and just give up on me, but instead he told me to do the right thing: Admit to Alan that I cheated, and get some kind of closure with Sam too.

So...I did that. I told Alan the truth. While it was not a serious relationship per see, he broke up with me, rightfully so (it was a clean, amicable break). It was also at this point where I realized that I couldn't stay with Sam after all I'd put him through. So much had been broken between us, and it couldn't be put back together again. It was extremely difficult for both of us, but we completely separated. I learned that he had become a *much* happier person later on.

Well...Rick and I still had feelings for each other. Even though I should have waited longer to do it, I got back together with him. But part of my crazy, attention-seeking side still had not left me...

Alan invited me over and I moronically agreed. Because we were both still emotionally close, I wasn't quite ready to end our relationship... Well. He did not know that I was back with Reed...and I didn't tell him. I sat in his lap while we browsed the internet, like old times...and he started massaging my breasts. Though nothing else happened other than this, I had cheated again...on the person who kept on sticking with me.

I felt utterly horrible. How could I do it again? I never learned at all, it seemed.

So I told Rick what I did, fully expecting him to just leave after that. Again...*he didn't* (how does one STAY after being put through so much shit?). His trust was deeply hurt, but he somehow still loved me. I have no damned clue how, but he forgave me on the spot. I was in fucking tears. I was *amazed* at how he loved me despite what I'd done. I'm tearing up a little just typing this.

It was Rick's astonishing love and patience that changed me. I stopped cheating. I stopped wanting attention from other men. I learned that just because you're close with multiple people, you can't have them all and should *never* try to do that.

I ended up burning bridges with Alan. It just had to be done, no matter how close we were. There was no way I would continue that relationship after what I had done to Rick.

I have been going strong with Rick for 2 years now. He's graduating college soon, I still have another year to go. We're aiming for a truly lasting relationship and have committed to each other completely. There are still lingering trust issues with Rick due to what I did back in 2010, and I don't blame him in the least. But the fact that he loves me and wants to make it work is amazing to me. I don't deserve him and can't believe I'm as lucky as I am.

**So...my advice to young INFJs everywhere: *DO NOT* let yourself be overwhelmed by multiple, deep connections with people, especially those of the sex you're attracted to. It is very, *very* difficult to burn bridges with those you really connect with. It was especially bad for me, because I had almost no friends in high school - and when I got to college and experienced these new connections with guys, I didn't want to throw any of them away. Wanting to be with everyone just ended up hurting everyone in the process. DO NOT try to rebound. If you get dumped, HEAL before you try another relationship. It will take lots of time, but it's so much better than rebounding and hurting people and yourself. INFJs want, badly, to be understood. *Do not let this desire for connections turn into a craving for attention*. It will make you desperate, selfish, confused, and fuck up your priorities. Do not be so quick to get close to members of the sex you're attracted to. Learn to create boundaries and draw lines. Make friends - REAL friends, not potential romantic candidates.**",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_y4vti,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/y4vti/i_want_to_share_a_story_i_cheated_multiple_times/,

Well, maybe not sexual attraction per se, but we do have the capability to build really intense relationships with different people from different walks of life (who might be of the opposite or same sex). Idk, I feel this way.

For the record, I'm a gay guy. While I'm self-assured that I'm into guys exclusively (as far as sexual stuff goes), I've had experiences where I (think I) fell in love with girls--but purely for their personality and wit. Maybe their physical attributes as well, but only because I can appreciate a person's beauty for the sake of being good-looking. Never for their breasts or butts (I felt awkward just typing that lol). Funny thing is, people keep telling me I might be bisexual, but afaik that would mean I'd be interested in hooking up with girls, which I am not. (**edit: fell in love with girls**, jeez, major point missed)

So. uh. I guess my questions are:

* What's your gender? What's your sexual orientation?
* Have you ever felt any sort of attraction towards the same (for heterosexual infjs) / opposite (for homosexual infjs) sex? How did you react to it? Was it an uncomfortable thought/experience? If not, do you think you're able to feel that attraction?
* Do you think infjs are bisexual/biromantic on the most basic level? Do we really have a capability to fall in love with any person (granted they pass all the stages we like putting people through)?
* Regardless of our sexual orientation, do you think we could develop enough intimacy with someone to want to have sex with them? Even if it's not what we're accustomed to?


(Also I read this post on reddit about straight people and experimenting with the same sex, and this straight guy shared his story about his straight best friend and they were basically in love or something, but no sex, and someone summarized the whole thing as ""you fell in love with a person, not a gender"". It was really something to think about.) 

I'm sorry if I'm making dumb generalizations. This was just a random thought that bugged me the whole day. I apologize for any offensive statements/questions I may have made/asked.

1343972269.0,10,self.infj,xlvf7,I'm a tested INFJ wondering if I'm actually an INFP...,notsureifINFP,13,3,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/xlvf7/im_a_tested_infj_wondering_if_im_actually_an_infp/,"I've posted this before in a few places but got pretty much no feedback, so I guess I'll just try again...

After doing some research on the differences between INFJs and INFPs, I've become pretty stuck on which type I fit into more. Lately I've been feeling as though I'm half and half, but I've been told that people cannot truly be 2 types.

I've long considered myself an INFJ, particularly because I love it when people open up to me. I like connecting with people on deeper levels and being the person that others go to when they need a shoulder to cry on. Although I can't have all the answers to those who need advice, I still try my best to consider their situation and give my honest input on what steps they should take. I feel at my best when others choose me to confide in. I like figuring out how people's minds work, and make it a point to put myself in their shoes to better understand their perspective. I'm very intuitive, a pattern seeker, focused on the big picture and read between the lines.

I'm pretty selective about who I share myself with, though I'm not extremely shy either. When I first meet someone, I'll open up a little bit so they might open up in return. The things I tell others about myself are highly dependent upon their personality and situation. Here's an example: There was something I did a few years ago that was very wrong and I regret. Well, I recently made a friend who was VERY open with me about himself. Somehow, he was comfortable enough with me to tell me that he did the same act I once committed, and that he was guilty about it. Normally, I would never tell others about what I did (especially not someone I haven't known long), but I told him that I'd been in his shoes before. I felt the need to assure him that he wasn't alone, that I completely understood, and that he could learn from it and move on (even if he could never make up for it). So when I do reveal things about myself (trivial or huge), it's normally with purpose: I seek relation with others. I want to connect to people, and I want them to feel comfortable connecting to me. If there are similar interests, I jump on that. If there AREN'T similar interests/values, though, it's incredibly hard to connect.

So, despite enjoying listening to people...I'm not always in the mood for it. Even if I do connect with a person, I'm not ALWAYS ready to talk to them or be sociable. Depending on the level of dispassion I have in that moment, I might come across as distant and aloof. I often want to just be left alone, especially if I don't personally care for someone. It's a bit paradoxical. I like listening to people, yet...if I don't personally LIKE someone, I'll probably disconnect from them. And I feel really selfish for it; I feel like I SHOULD be there for everyone I get to know, even if I turn out to not entirely care for them. I WANT to care, but oftentimes I don't.

Now, in terms of functions, I'm really not sure if I utilize more Fe or Fi. While I do like connecting with people, I am also quite...well, selfish. I focus a TON on myself, who I really am, where I'm going in life (for instance, I'm just FASCINATED about which type I really am). I seethe inside if I feel that my values are being threatened, and if I'm pushed too hard, I'll either withdraw or blow up. If someone is angering me, I war with myself: Half of me wants to reach out, put myself in their shoes and try to respect them, even if I dislike them. The other half wants to either lash out or withdraw with indignation. While I want to at least UNDERSTAND others, it's always very difficult for me if it's someone I personally dislike (though I'm sure this is the case for most people).

And then there's Ni vs. Ne. While I believe I use Ni more often, I still definitely use Ne (especially if I'm not knowledgeable about a subject and require multiple sources before drawing an intuitive conclusion). While I am a judgmental person by nature, I often try to tell myself not to jump to conclusions about a person. This works only half the time though, it seems...

I'm unsure about whether I'm more Si or Se (could someone explain the difference?), but I THINK I'm more Ti than Te. I usually keep my thoughts to myself if I sense I'll start an argument.

Some other tidbits about me... I like categories, I don't mind labels (or being labeled myself). I'm probably more of a directing type than an informer. I take care not to offend others, especially ones I don't know well. I'm a TERRIBLE procrastinator; I know I should be working on my art portfolio (3D modeling is my specialization), but I'm constantly wracked by laziness. I have an innate desire to travel overseas and help people in third world countries. I think about the future all the time - the future with my boyfriend, if he'll still love me in the coming years, if my career life will be successful, if I'll have children, if I'll travel, if I'll do good in the world... I have a lot of trouble living in the here and now. I'm a worrywart. When I'm upset, I usually talk it out with a loved one depending on the magnitude of my distress (if I'm upset for a relatively short amount of time, I'll probably just burn it off while listening to music). I'm really bad with directions. I'm not fond of small talk (I much prefer deeper conversations), nor am I the ""hostess"" type who's constantly asking, ""Would you like a drink?"", ""Is it too cold in here?"", ""Can I get you something?"". I tend to expect people to tell me if they need anything. I have a really hard time ending deep relationships. Finishing creative things I start is extremely challenging for me. I don't mind deadlines (I probably wouldn't finish anything without deadlines).

I frequent r/infj often looking for answers how to cope with my personality, and I think everyone here has done an outstanding job in communication.

Often I feel that operating my personality is like navigating through a dark maze-- the only way of finding my way is feeling this ""path"", memorizing the path; recognizing patterns, similarities, noticing coincidences, etc. I feel like my consciousness lies in a galaxy far, far away, and that I'm not always the one in control, better put: I'm a third party observer to the beauty and chaos that is life. Do I sound like an INFJ to you?


Though life is uncertain, I welcome change, I ride the tidal wave of possibilities, and in the past this has excited me and perpetuated me forward. Yet, the past few months I feel like I've been observing life through a cloud, as if my ""maze"" is filled with a smoke, so to speak. I feel like I've lost my drive to pursue my arts (I create films). 


The weirdest thing is that I have a voice telling me that despite my mentality, or rather my interpretation of experiencing, that I will continue on to do what I'm meant to do-- I'll progress on. And, actually, this is correct. I haven't stopped making films, finding work, writing, exercising, etc. Considering that, I must look like I have my shit together from the outside world. But as many of you INFJ's know, the internal world is another story.


I feel as my intuitiveness is diminishing, and I'm not sure how to exercise it, to feel that I'm on the right path again. But perhaps all of this is spiraling doubt, and an illusion of uncertainty, because I'm certainly still pressing on towards my ambitions, but I don't feel as passionate nor driven towards it, if that makes any sense.


Do any other INFJ's feel this way sometimes, and is it something that will pass?

Something that INFJs seem to be better than most at is reading other people, with maybe one exception; INTJs. 

INTJs express things (especially emotions) somewhat differently than other types and everyone seems to have problems with these expressions (except maybe other INTJs). In my opinion, INFJs are not immune to this misreading of INTJs. So my question is, when dealing with an INTJ, how do you know when you are wrong about what you've ""read"" from them?  From an INTJ perspective, a well thought out, logical argument seems to do little to convince an INFJ that they're mistaken about an INTJ expression (as well as other things but that's a different story). Seems that in order for an INFJ to be convinced that they were wrong, they have to ""feel"" that they were wrong. Which seems like nothing short of time traveling to re-experience an event will give that feeling. It seems that even if an INFJ admits they were wrong, they do it to end the argument and not because they really thought they were wrong. I would like to get your perspective.

[Text Wall],pouncer11,18,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1h92zd/the_meaning_of_life_whats_the_point_to_all_of_it/,"I see a lot of INFJ folk posting here and discussing or worrying about the meaning behind life or their purpose. I think that yearning is a human thing, but I also feel like we spend more time on that thought than some other types. 

In all my introspection and soul searching I do believe I have come to an understanding that I am satisfied with. I dont really fear death or the dark and I dont believe that humanity can go down the wrong path for too long. I am sure that others have reached similar conclusions and some people on this Earth can probably take it a step further, but I aim to share in hope of helping.

I look at religion and dont really get anything from it. It all seems too petty and small minded and human. So tossing out religion I am left with Atheism and that leaves me with ""The world is shit and everyone is shit, and it doesn't matter anyways"". I dont think anyone could or should exist in that realm of thought for very long. It is pretty negative and ultimately small minded, but you're on the right track. That negative thought train combined with some shitty life events put me in a bad head space. 

In my bad space I begin to ponder. I stop to think about how crazy huge our universe is and all that good stuff. Then I move to our lowly planet and all its life. The bacteria in my gut, the tree scratching my window, my dog, myself all have life in common. We all aim to reproduce and better survive and we all work together to do so. 

Even if we dont have an understanding of how life started or a definite ""purpose"", we do know that we are all here trying to keep life going. You can spray pesticide down, pour a foot of gravel, and cover it with a foot of asphalt, but leave it for a couple years and youll have some weeds popping up in some cracks. You cannot stop it. Not even a meteor. 

Humans are at that point where laying our seed down isn't a primary concern. If we dont need to reproduce and we have access to basic resources, then what do we do (yes I know that not everyone does...)? We find ways to better preserve life. 


Technology doubles in speed and power every 18 months or so ( [moore's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law) ). Knowing this we should reach a point where discoveries are almost instant. That said, we are quickly approaching new technologies that you and I cannot fathom. 


Energy is the main source of evil as far as I can see in the world. Gas costs money, the truck that takes the bread to the store runs on gas, and the store uses coal powered plants to light the inside so you can see the bread that you drove in your car to buy. I could get more in depth with examples, but you get it. With technological advances so quickly arriving at our doors, free energy is inevitable even if the greedy bastards dont like it. 

You have an energy source that costs nothing and you then have people working an awful lot less to get what they need. This gives them the opportunity to learn more, experience more, share more. 

Say you trip acid and write a song. I am driving home from my shitty day at work all stressed out, and your song comes on. It inspires me to start my painting hobby again. My painting is hung in a coffee shop and it inspires someone to go to school for psychology. The psychologist encourages her patient to follow her dreams and go to school for bio medical engineering. This person develops life saving technologies. That is an exaggeration, but my point is that it doesnt matter what you do on Earth as long as you experience and exist and inevitably share. 

I've had a few friends pass away that were pretty close to me recently, and I realize that even in their death they have made an impact on so many people. It has altered my thought processes in ways that I may not even be fully aware of. So even in their death they make a change that I would say is positive or you can at least find a positivity in it. Causes people to look back and remember and maybe not take life for granted and go after what they love. 

Back to the free energy thing. Socialism and Communism in theory work well, but they dont in real life ? Why? Many reasons, but say everyone is treated equal and everyone drives a VW Beetle and lives in the same house. Well I want a fucking Porsche. Cant have it. 

Well say we have to work a lot less because we dont have to pay as much for things. I can work a little extra at my job and get that Porsche and so can my neighbor if he wants. Everyone would have a much more fair opportunity at life. People would have a much more level playing field because you dont have someone holding all the power, the energy and the greed and money behind that. I probably am not articulating my thoughts as well as Id like, but hopefully you get the point here. 


I think about the greedy fucks at the top and I wonder. You have to be pretty smart to get to the top of the world in terms of power. If you are there, then surely youve fucked over loads of people. So organized religion is probably not on your plane. Back to being smart and having it all, after you have it all what do you do/ think? I dont like playing games after I beat them. Being shitty to the world or limiting it by having everything has to get old. I would hope that in all their being intelligent and getting to the top, these people would come to a similar conclusion about everything. Maybe they are just messed up in the head, but I almost wonder if things arent being pushed by these folks into something better. I guess I dont understand all that. 


My whole point though, is that the point of everything would seem to be that we need to share and experience and not be assholes to each other. If we do this it cant go wrong. Even if it does life will continue. We as humans are at that teetering point where we have powerful and destructive technology and we are quite irresponsible. We have the power to wipe most of the planet out, but I dont think you could take out everyone or everything. I think that whomever was left after some kind of nuclear war would be able to retain necessary knowledge and rebuild things better. I think it would take a meteor to stop us. Even then life would evolve and something else would get where we are and try again. 

I think if we continue on our path though, we have the potential to evolve ourselves and plants. We are already sorta doing that, but obviously I mean in a more correct way and for the good of things. To spread life in the universe.

Perhaps some other life forms have done that and that is how life on Earth started. 

People talk about aliens and how they would bomb us and destroy our planet or take our resources if they found us. I don think this is the case. In order to come here, they would have to have technology far beyond anythign we can fathom. They would have to have already overcome the limited resource problem. We would probably be as ants to them and I dont think harming us or interfering would do much good for something that can traverse the universe. 


In our lifetime we will see some crazy shit and I think that everything is on the brink of a calm positivity. Probably not without struggle, but if things fall apart they will never go back to the way they are now. 

Okay, that is probably messy to read and it is more organized in my head, but I felt it needed shared.

I live in an area that is full of one-way streets. If I'm particularly stressed or frustrated (usually with finding just ONE parking space), it becomes harder and harder for me to be aware of which streets are one-way and two-way. I feel like I am going in circles (probably because I literally am) and I become more and more likely to make wrong turns and more desperate for a parking space, which in this case -- I'll spare you the details -- ended up giving me my first ticket.

I feel pretty out of control in many cases when it comes to driving and traffic signs. I always disappear when in a group when people ask for drivers, and my peers always seem to be in more control when they are in stressful driving situations. They are also quick to tease me when I get anxious or tense at the thought of driving. Though practice has given me much confidence, I still prefer to drive alone, and I try to avoid driving to places where/when I know parking will be limited.

Earlier in my life, when I was visitin a therapist, I talked about me and my group of friends. My group of friends is not much like me when is comes to tastes, whether we're talking about music, movies, internet, wtv. Of course we have some common stuff, but in most things I'm kinda the black sheep there. So my therapist said that it was odd that I would fit so well with them and was also odd that even having the fact that they have different likes I wasn't feeling ""bad"" neither was trying to have the same likes as them. 

So, do you somehow feel the same? You ""preserve"" your identity regardless of the people that you hang out with? Do you feel the need to be equal or do you usually stand out?

If you're strengthening your relationship with another country by trading secrets, make damn sure you take the *nuclear* secrets off table. And for the love of god, don't show them exactly where to strike. See if I'm talking with a close friend and they ask a personal question, I feel being disingenuous is pretty unsavory if you consider them a close friend. Lying in this situation would have been less painful but not nearly as beneficial in the long run than what actually happened. If given the opportunity to relive that soul crushing event over, I would do it the exact same way over again for that painful revelation.

What I learned about exposing yourself to close friends:

* Be damn well sure they are a close friend, in that they would never hurt you intentional.
* Inform them of your sensitivity on the subject and that if they wish to hear it, they mustn't use it against you. Provided they're a close friend.
* Or say ""No."" 
* What learned to say: ""Some people get embarrassed when talking about themselves. I can slide into a full-on, month-long, depression by simple recollection of things in my past. Hearing every little remark about the subject leaves an painful burn. And telling you would be giving you the ability to turn me into a burn victim. The people I tell would never commit such an act because they love and care for me enough, to not put me through that ordeal. Maybe one day in the future but not today.""

Anyone else expose themselves like this?

**Edit: The reason I share it under the right circumstances is that it feels better to physically tell someone I trust rather than post it on reddit to have it analyzed/ignored/ridiculed.

It's pensive and a bit sad but there's a hopeful quality to it at the same time. It helps that I love disco and late 70s funk so this is the perfect rainy day song.
[Something About Us - Daft Punk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOS9aOIXPEk)

Then there's **Kate Bush**, my biggest musical influence. I'm a songwriter and her lyrics are always very left field, she never writes a simple love song. This song is very introspective. A major reason I love her is for her storytelling, her songs really feel like you're reading a book sometimes. 
[Symphony In Blue - Kate Bush](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NRlQ0UfRRd0)

I really can't stand today's dance pop music. It's all about sex and excess. But I love some earlier 2000s dance music such as **Kylie Minogue**. It's funky and a bit sexy but still very wistful and longing, a quality I tend to love in songs. This was my favorite song when I was 10 years old. I used to listen to it non stop and it still holds up today.
[Can't Get You Out Of My Head - Kylie Minogue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZZiQ4KVj0k)

And I love a bit of good old cheesy 80s power pop sometimes. If you don't like this song by **Bonnie Tyler** then I don't know if we can be friends.
[Total Eclipse Of The Heart - Bonnie Tyler](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcOxhH8N3Bo)

I'll top off this post with **Breakbot**, a current favorite of mine. Like I said, I love disco and funk, so forgive my cheesy tastes in music. Again, very wistful and longing lyrics, that's a theme that tends to run through a lot of the songs I listen to.

Don't scheme. 
Open up, really it is ok. 
We follow the two is company, three is a crowd rule.
People drain us. 


When we interact with people it is a firehose of information. A lot of times we will look lost, won't look you in the eye, seem distracted. We are fully engaged and processing a plethora of clues, senarios, paths, and information.

We can usually tell when you are planning things or hiding something, and will be turned off if you are not up front or deceitful about them.
IF YOU PLAN AROUND US TELL US UP FRONT. 

We have a vast understanding of the human condition. 

We appreciate small things like compliments, and hugs more than fancy superficial things. That doesn't mean we don't like nice things every now and then. With us its more the motive that counts.

Be prepared to be deep. INFJ have incredible inner lives. What looks like stirring a cup of coffee could be a complex thought experiment.

If you ask us a question, be prepared for a candid answer. That includes, ""how are you?""

We are incredibly curious about the world around us.

We care deeply for those who we choose to be close to us. 

We can be brutally honest. 
We expect the same. 

Don't underestimate our love and humor.

We are highly protective and selective of those we choose to let in. Consider it an honor. Pray you never forsake that.

Any time I try to describe it to others it doesn't make any sense, so I wonder if it will make sense for anyone else here. I think it's practical to view it my way, less stress. 

In terms of my personal timeline- I have a very long way to go. 50, maybe even 60 years if I'm lucky and take care of myself. Potentially longer, even. As such, I'm not pressed- I don't 'hurry' when it comes to personal task. I frequently lose chunks of time(I.e. growing out a haircut, the time between health appointments). I'll be going for my post secondary after we decide on if we're having a third, at the moment it's not high priority. I'm a SAHM so my time sense is a bit skewed by that as well, totally admit it. I have to set reminders for playgroups etc. because otherwise I'm not sure what day of the week I'm on. Husbands shifts make for screwy time keeping as well, although he's a well oiled clock.

I take appointments/meeting times very seriously and am present 5-10 minutes ahead of time- the only time I was late to work was my ride never showed up and I walked. Punctuality= courtesy for me.

Then, there's real world time: everything is frenetic. Everything needs to be accomplished yesterday, if not last week. Hurry, hurry, stop, weekend, speed up again. It baffles me why everyone around me works their asses off to run away to someplace sunny for two weeks of the year- then the rest of the year is spent fantasizing about those weeks off. I know, vacations are nice. I just know too many folk that work themselves into this frenzy instead of being able to relax(gotta go sightseeing, try all the available activities/amenities) that frankly? Their vacation is more work than being able to process any one thing. If they are processing I have no idea how. Or relaxing. Don't get it.

Over the last couple of years, it's been dawning on me that this ""hurry hurry stop"" is very normal, very common, and was wondering if fellows of my personality type have noticed this as well? Or is my time sense just all kinds of whacked? Share how you process time too, please.

I've experienced this somewhat regularly myself (although sometimes it's less of ""sixth-sense"" type phenomena and rather a ""super-rational"" type thing.)

For instance, here's two rather bizarre ones in recent memory.

I went clothes shopping a while back, and I found a style of shirt that I liked, so I happened to buy two of the same shirt in the same color (just in case one should get ruined, yay, I'd have a back-up!). I work for an anime convention, so when I went, I packed up a bunch of clothes, and, for some reason, I decided to pack BOTH of the (identical) shirts. 

Now, I had a friend who also attended. Unfortunately, she had a bit of a costume mishap, and ended up with a rather noticeable hole in her dress. But, I remembered my identical shirts which were pretty much the exact shade of her dress. So, we butchered one of them (it was a cheap shirt, anyway), so that we could make a convincing patch for her dress. And then I got an assload of weird looks when I explained that I had, in fact, bought two identical shirts and just happened to bring them both with me, and so would not feel the lack of that particular shirt.


As for the other one - my boyfriend and his brother were supposed to go to a concert in Houston (we live in Dallas). But, I got a funny feeling about my boyfriend's car (which is, admittedly, not always the most stable mode of transportation). I told him to call me if anything went wrong with his car and I'd be more than happy to take him and his brother to Houston, and, even though I SHOULD have just gone home (after having spent the night at his place), instead I went and filled up on gas, bought a couple bottles of water, and was on my way to a nearby coffee shop to wait for his phone call, which I was sure would soon be coming.

I didn't even make it to the coffee shop before he called and asked if I'd still be willing to take them, and he was just amazed that I was all prepared (to the point of having packed for an overnight trip, just in case).


To me, it feels like being MORE than prepared, but I think to other people it looks like I know things before they happen, and it's sort of a weird feeling.

So, I guess I'm just asking, does anybody else have these weird little coincidences?

Lately Ive found I disagree with most everyone.  I am an atheist determinist, and the idea of no free will kind of dominates my thoughts.  I often wonder what motivates people to become what they are, and talk about it.  Apparently... NO ONE wants to discuss this, except people who are into philosophy and they are all tired of discussing it, it seems.  

Well when I see someone post on facebook I usually look at it from a different angle and like an idiot post my thoughts.  Some things can make basic logical sense, but people still argue against the idea.  

Just look at the idea of free will.  If we had it... why do people worry how their kids are raised?  Aren't they going to just turn out how they want to anyway?  And if you admit that kids are a product of their environment... how can you hate a kid who grows up to be someone following those environmental factors.  Science is proving this, it's not just philosophy. Neuroscience is proving that we do not actually have free will.   Im not sure if it is an INFJ thing, but if it logically makes sense, than I am fine with it no matter how unwelcome it is.  But.. it seems that every other human being is not like this, at all.  The idea of free will applies to so many ideas in society, it pops into my head in almost every conversation.  ""That guy is scum, he deserves to go to prison and get raped""  All I can think is ""damn if that guy was born in Bill Gates' household, it is almost assured he would not be where he is.  How can we really hate that guy""?

My favorite example: I read once about a woman who had trouble with relationships, holding a job, etc.  Very hard to deal with.  She found out she had a hormone imbalance.  Shey got medication... suddenly she has good relationships, friendships, and holds a job.  Well, what about someone halfway between that woman and 'normal'?  That woman just gets labeled a bitch, and written off by everyone.  But she is likely not having enough problems to get a test or think there is something really wrong with her.  And there might not be, she just has more of a hormone in her body than most people.  But, it makes her personality clash with others.  She drew the unlucky straw out of the gene pool.  Bad enough to cause problems, but not bad enough to stick out enough that we make medicine for it, or are likely to even look for a medical reason for the problem.  And no one cares.  

Anyway, apparently no one wants to hear this sort of stuff.  Since it pops up into my brain constantly, I end up blurting stuff out like this, and then I am the guy that ruins the party.  My dad is a thinker like I am but he avoids unwelcome truths like this, so even someone who seems to have a similar personality to me ends up getting irritated.  

Sigh.  Anyone else like this?  This INFJ forum is my only hope to maybe find someone who understands and can maybe offer advice.

I... feel like I'm losing sense of who I am. I'm operating at the bare minimum last 5% of ""me"" and all other systems have been shut down long ago, waiting for that vital, refreshing recharge from some alone time.  
He's an extrovert, we've been friends since childhood. I've learned I love being humble, I feel like it's something respect-worthy and even a bit noble perhaps, something to thrive for. He seems to not grasp this concept in any regard. I've always felt he's not as good of a person as I would like to be. I love helping, going the extra mile for others, caring, letting them lead if that's what they seem to like... but with him, if I let myself be this way even for a tiny moment he seems to instantly take this for granted, demand for even more and never once return any sort of similar courtesy.  
I feel like I have to be on full guard alpha male 24/7 while with him, otherwise he'll put me on a lower level, make me into some kind of follower in *his pack* (?!) and try to control and guide me. Me being kind is not a weakness, I'm just trying to be a good person and I *like* being kind. On the same time I'm feeling as above his level of intelligence, too. Perhaps he's feeling threatened? Everything is always a competition, or am I causing it myself by the very *""feeling above his intelligence""*? Can we never be just equals then, must it always be rivalry? If I ""win"" I would actually like to *let him win*, which I can't do, so instead I'll try to be as humble about it as possible, almost as if I ""won"" by accident... but if he wins, he'll be as if it's the normal, average state of how the world is, like it's to be expected that he's always above me... Perhaps precisely because I leave it as if it was an accident? He doesn't seem to be able to distinguish between this subtle nuance... So the only conclusion I've arrived at so far is to simply play the game and be more like a leader and mastermind of our little duo. This has lead to even more competition and recently it's like I might've actually pulled it off. However, on the same time I'm feeling as if I'm turning into a worse person because I can't utilize the good part of myself and by competing against him I'm essentially training myself to be more *like him*.

He has no problem farting whenever it's just the two of us (asserting dominance? :D), I spend long hours away from the hotel every day just to avoid him, but it's not recharging me because I'm spending it in public places. I want to be alone, just for a little while.  
Yesterday I didn't say a word to him during a 50 minute bus ride, just stood there hands tied, feeling mutually hateful both towards him for making irrelevant small talk (something that I'd usually brush off as unimportant, but after months of being the sole recipient to this vocalization of near constant stream of thought I've grown extremely annoyed at it) and also to myself for becoming such a person who's letting myself be annoyed by all this...  
One time he said I'm grumpy and bitchy like I'm on period, I don't think I've ever received a worse insult, not because there was anything wrong with being on period, but rather because it shifts all the blame on me, like I'm the weirdo and it's my fault feeling trapped, worn down and squeezed out. I'm not saying it's his fault either, I'm just looking for a way out of it. I don't want to start any kind of confrontation, I don't want to talk it out with him because this way I'm admitting there's something annoying me and again instantly I'm the whiny one with the issue. I feel like screaming ""shut the fuck up and let me be, I can simulate every single fucking reaction you make in my head and it's driving me insane because I could literally say what you're going to say next a second before you do because we've spent almost every minute of every day together for the last half a years and my head is filled up of *you* to the last drop."" Instead I keep my mouth shut and say something along the lines of ""ah fuck off what ever man."" 

He seems to effortlessly keep going, no need for any personal space or time alone, seems to regain energy from meeting people and there's no end to the chatter he's spewing out on any random momentary topic..., while I feel like an empty sack of a last endangered animal withering away having been pumped free of some odd sparkly juice. 

So what the hell do I do. There's still months before we can even hope to go our separate path. I'm really losing myself here, I'm doubting every reaction, analyzing every stupid small detail, feeling terrorized, trying to think my way into accepting the situation, searching for solutions while slowly feeling the core *me* changing into something I despise.

i have read up onthe cognitive functions, primarily from this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/mbti/comments/182ri9/comprehensive_mbti_post/

This was my thought process for narrowing it down to INFJ or INTP....

I know I'm an introvert. This is very very clear from tests, reading about introversion, and what my friends say. So, this narrows it down to the 8 introverted types. 

After reading up on the cognitive functions, I can identify at least to some degree with most of them, but I identify least with Se and Si. (Another way to look at this is that I identify with Keirsey's Idealists and Rationals much more than Artistans or Guardians.) So I narrowed it down to those types that do not have Se or Si as one of the first two functions:

* Ni Fe Ti Se (INFJ)
* Ni Te Fi Se (INTJ)
* Fi Ne Si Te (INFP)
* Ti Ne Si Fe (INTP)

Between Fe and Fi, I prefer Fe. So:

* Ni Fe Ti Se (INFJ)
* Ti Ne Si Fe (INTP)

**tl;dr I have read up on cognitive functions, and I've narrowed it down to INFJ or INTP. I would very much appreciate any advice, suggestions, or corrections to any misunderstandings/mistakes in my thought process. I would also appreciate an explanation of J and P (besides the stereotypical J's are organized, P's are always late, etc), Se/Si, and Ne/Ni.**

I can't even get around to tell my parents, friends, co-workers etc. In my eyes, my problem is just so minuscule, and I don't feel it's worth the bother to bug other people about it, so I just hide it.

I thought this subreddit would be the ideal place to ask for help in writing my master thesis, as we infj's are people who like to delve deep into our inner worlds, full of dreams, desires, fantasy and imagination. My fascination with the latter, imagination, led me to the idea of writing my thesis on it. I actually wrote a paper on the (re)discovery of a unicorn lair in North Korea, using the concept of imagination (in relation to both the idea of a unicorn and the concept of 'imagined communities' by Benedict Anderson), and it worked extremely well. In fact, I enjoyed writing about it so much that I want to further explore the concept of imagination, but here's the thing: the concept itself is so abstract, it even signifies 'the unreal', and I'm afraid of losing myself  in trying to tackle this concept. So I’m looking for concrete examples that relate to the concept of imagination. Think of cultural objects: art works that represent imagination, movies, books, news articles, commercials, cultural/social practices, videogames,memes etc. (I study cultural analysis, hence the concept/object thing). On a side note, I'm interested in issues of (national) identity and globalization. So anything related to that would be awesome!

What do you think is a good example of imagination? What do you think of when you think of imagination, of imagination in practice?

Looking for some advice on how to approach sex / make this good for him / make him happy / make us happy / open the conversation / how much of a lead should I take / etc etc etc. 

We're both 19. He's INFJ/virgin and I'm ENTJ/lots of sexual history. I've pretty much been ""holy crap how do I proceed"" since finding out that he's an INFJ. Normally, I would just be my straightforward self and talk about it a little beforehand but mostly just dive into the sex. But then I found out his typing and CRAP you guys are the hopeless romantic type (he definitely is for sure) and this super intense emotional intimacy doesn't come naturally for me. All my past sexual relationships have just been good/fun sex with zero emotional attachment so I feel like I might not be able to give him the level of emotional response that he might need -- at least not right off the bat.


We only started being together early this month, but I truly think we're going to be together for a good long while, so I just don't want to fuck up. Especially since he's a virgin. In a couple weeks, we're going to a ski resort for spring break and we'll have a whole room to ourself so this is when I'm hoping to start having sex with him.


In the meantime, we've made out and slept together so I think he's definitely comfortable with the whole intimacy/being in bed thing. However I think he might be a bit shy(or, god forbid, indifferent?) towards sex. For example, I attended a fashion show that included women modeling lingerie. I snapped pictures and texted him them with things like ""too bad you aren't here. these women are so hot."" or ""omg this girl's legs"" and etc but he didn't have any reaction at all and just texted back asking me about what clothes I liked on the non-lingerie lines... 

(He knows that I've had relationships with girls in the past and says he isn't surprised, so hopefully my texts didn't come off as too crude :/)

You know what I mean.

For background, I am a 26yo straight male (INFJ), and one of my personal struggles is the inability to find friends who I can *really* talk to.  I have many nice friends, but the conversations lack the depth I need.  About five years ago, I underwent some significant life changes that involved the sudden ability to lucid dream.  

Now, I know many people in the larger population have experienced some form of lucid dreaming, but these were dreams nearly on the level of Inception (the movie).  It’s common for people who become lucid in a dream to wake themselves up or do something fun like fly around.

Now, I’m an INFJ, so what do you suppose I would do?  I walk around the dreamworld and find people to talk to.  *Really* talk to.  I ask them questions about life, about myself, about anything.  Here’s the funny thing that I imagine you’ll appreciate: at least half of the dream characters I encounter have NO IDEA what I’m talking about.  Some blankly stare at me, some cry, some run away, etc.  For example, I might say, “Excuse me, sir.  Do you have a moment to talk?  Great…well I wanted to inform you that we are inside of a dream, and if it’s okay, I’d like to ask you a few questions about that.”  Crickets.  Sound familiar?

I have somewhat of an idea for the reason this occurs, but that would take up another post.  Anyway, the whole point of this is that I have had some incredible dream conversations that can be cathartic and help fill the void of what’s missing in real life (if you prefer to call it that).  Additionally, I believe some of the traits of INFJs – restrained emotion, composure, an interest in the esoteric – make us ideal candidates for lucid dreaming, given the right circumstances.  I have to be in a healthy routine and avoid too much stress during the day.  Yoga and meditation certainly help on that front.  If dreaming is not something pay much attention at the present, I would encourage you to give it a second thought.

On a final note, I’m in the process of writing several books that detail some of these dream adventures.  I hope that it will serve as a medium that allows me to open up and share my true feelings, fears and desires with a wider audience.  

Thanks for letting me share this experience with you.

",,13,3,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/180mhb/i_seem_to_be_irritating_everyone_i_know_and_i/,"Hmm, how do I make a tl;dr of this?  Right now i have my mother not talking to me because she feels we made a mistake not just forcing our kids to cry at night and sleep on their own, we co-slept, generally.  My son has very bad allergies growing up, and was really, REALLYL hard to deal with.  He would wake up at night screaming, stiff as a board, itchy with excema, etc.  He slept better when he slept with us.  

My father disagrees with everything I say.  Everything.  Politics, computers, iphones... anything we talk about, he thinks differently.  the other day he told me 'shane anyone can be a historian, even a drug addict'. 

The problem seems to be that i have ideas that are different from what most people I know think or feel.  this seems to fit the INFJ thing.  My dad wants to believe the regular view that the TV tells him about politics or history, and my mother thinks we should spank our kids because 'everyone does it'.  

I think that we should look at all option and make a choice.  Science shows us that spanking is bad, so I dont do it.  it is POSSIBLE that the studies are flawed, and spanking works better, but my argument with my parents is that they have ZERO evidence to show spanking is effective.  They say 'well I turned out fine, and I was spanked'.  That is just a correlation, what if you turned out ok *in spite of* the spanking?

I have had similar problems with friends too.  I ask them if I am doing something to irritate them, they never tell me.  I try to be open to the idea that I am doing something wrong but most attempts to talk to people end up with it turning into an argument.  I *think* that I am being mature about this, but EVEN admit I could be wrong, and want to talk to people... and all i get is people telling me I have 'extreme views' (mother).  

Im beginning to think that most people are just really, REALLY scared by someone who is open to other ideas and ways to live life.  Or it could be me of course, but I cant figure it out.

The best way I knew how to do this is draw names by hand, and it's easier for me to list matches by here usernames, and then you can message your match directly for their address.

Does that work for everyone?
Feel free to message me if you still need their contact info (say someone has been slow about replying or off their computer lately) almost everyone remembered to fill out that section on our online form.

Also, users who indicated they are mailing postcards only I matched with other users who are mailing the same, hopefully that way no one will feel left out of the exchange that way.

I'm terrible at things like math, computer science, anything that requires understanding of a logical system. I'm not very good at puzzles - I mean, it's not like I *can't* do them, but I get bored with them if I can't solve them immediately (they often take a lot of time for me) and I give up.

I posted here a while back, but I've done some more ""soul searching"" in recent weeks, and I've got two questions I'd like to put to you guys.

1) Nearly all the profiles and many self-descriptions say that INFJs tend to dislike conflict and to avoid it as much as possible.  For me, that's only half-true; I can't stand it when people around me are in pointless conflict, but I love a good fight about something important.  Going to one friend's house is very stressful because he and his dad get into truly unnecessary screaming matches nearly every time, but I have no qualms about getting into passionate debates about moral or political issues.  When I was on my university's SGA executive board, I was usually the person picked to defend the board's ideas when we took them to the floor.  This ""love of battle"" seems non-INFJ to me, but maybe I'm wrong.

2) After reading [this post](http://personalitycafe.com/infj-articles/68718-really-me-how-stress-brings-out-infjs-hidden-personality.html) on PersonalityCafe, I recognized a lot of the ""INFJ under stress"" behaviors as things I've been doing for a while now.  Obviously, I'd like to stop them and go back to being ""me.""  The usual method, and the one I would use if I could, is to separate from the situation and recharge in solitude.  Unfortunately, I'm currently living with my parents to help them take care of my grandmother, and the small house and nearly daily ""babysitting"" duty do not allow for much privacy.  For instance, I can hear my grandmother's TV from anywhere in the house, and she watches it nearly all day, so I'm constantly hearing repeats of *The Waltons* and *Little House on the Prairie*.  I also don't get much time to sit and get something done, because I'm constantly getting called to help her with something.  To be clear, I don't mean to complain.  I just want some advice on how an INFJ should deal with reducing stress when isolating himself is not an option.

I'm sorry if I got long-winded, but I wanted to make sure I included all of the necessary details.  I'd appreciate any advice on either question.

The girl I was dating ended up leaving me for her abusive ex boyfriend who had dumped her prior to us getting together, and it's really struck me deep. She spent the whole relationship telling me why I was better than him, and I actually built up a level of self esteem that I've never had in my life before, and then left me for the same person. I'm still having trouble getting over this, and I still feel so alone again.

Now, my introversion has reached an all time high. I'm screaming inside for meaningful personal relationships, but I don't have the motive to go get them. Any time I try to bond with new people, I end up holing myself up, and it leads to awkward silence's(especially during car rides... I don't know if any other INFJ's are susceptible to the awkward car ride silence). When the phone rings, I just look at it and let it go on. I get intrigued by the idea of parties and social gatherings, and then avoid them at all costs when they arrive.

I have a story for you. Its about my self perception of being an INFJ, why I thought I was an INFJ, and how it has impacted me. 

In my teenage years I labeled myself an INFJ. I cried a lot in my younger years. I thought I was an emotional person who was reserved. Sounds about right - I'm an INFJ.

As a result, I really learned how to get in touch with my feelings. Over the years, after hating myself for being emotional, I learned to really embrace it and develop strong empathy for others who undergo emotionally traumatic events. I learned to dig deep into myself and 'feel' the reason of the way I ticked.

Ten years after finding out what I am, I took the official Myer Briggs personality test at my local community college. It was proctored by my counseling professor. Results came back: ENTJ.

What?

Certainly this couldn't be right - I know I act extroverted, but I was shy for a long time as a kid. It is a result  of my 'extroverted feeling function.' Also, I know I can be a 'Thinker' in many ways, but how else could I explain my *emotional* childhood...?

Then, I realized, my emotional, reserved childhood and adolescence was not all me. Upon reflection, my tears and being shy wasn't because I couldn't make friends. Or that friends would make fun of me. Or that I wasn't good at school or that people hated me. 

I was an emotional reserved child and adolescent because I was emotionally abused.

It has been such a long time since I've thought about it - that stuff has been tucked away for over a decade. But all the times I've felt bad and cried severely was because my father would verbally abuse me. 

The abuse turned me inward. The abuse made me emotional. As a young child who only blamed himself for weakness, I sought solace in being an INFJ. I devoured other INFJ-like people's work and to this day, I still hold the words of Marcus Aurelius, MLK and Plato in high regard and are values that guide my life.

But in many ways, my true inherent nature has always been there. The hallmark word of an ENTJ is 'leader.' Looking back, before the abuse started, I was often called the ""Bossy kid"" on the playground. 

Teachers loved me, but also hated when I would flagrantly break their asinine rules. In High School, I took leadership of many clubs, and in college I became a club president and led a small group of student-veterans for the Occupy Los Angeles movement. In most classes in High School and College, I get to know at least half the people in a class.

Interestingly, I still get super nervous when talking to a large group of people. 

In everything I did, however, was always with the highest respect for other people. I learned to never think I was always right. I learned to look into myself for deep-seated problems. I learned to listen to other's problems earnestly. I never sought power or leadership simply for the lust of it. I learned the better part of valor is discretion. I did all that because I thought that's what INFJ did, therefore I should do it too. Nah, I was just developing my inferior functions. No wonder it was so hard!

I don't know if there really is a point to this post. If anything, I suppose it would be that hard times make for strong people in the long run. Learning more about oneself, how one ticks, teaches how to learn how other's tick. 

Now that I've been working on my tertiary and inferior functions for so long, working on my strengths should be a lot easier. :)

After taking several different online tests and heavily researching the cognitive functions, I have determined I am an INTJ. However, I still have this lingering doubt because I feel like I *could* be an INFJ. Maybe. Here are the things that confuse me:

* I *think* I'm fairly empathetic for an INTJ. I generally try not to hurt peoples' feelings. If my thoughts are going to upset things, I'll keep quiet because I don't want to be the one to cause issues.
* I get upset about stuff like such as womens' political issues (ex: rape cases), animal rights issues, etc.
* I'm emotionally expressive with people I'm close with and am able to analyze and clearly describe how I feel. I would describe myself as very in touch with emotions. 
* My feelings can and do get hurt, and I can be pretty sensitive, though usually if someone dislikes me or offends me I shrug it off because it's not worth my mental energy.
* I value sincerity and genuineness in people, and like people who seem like they have a ""good heart."" I dislike people who are unkind or thoughtless. For example, I dislike Republicans because I believe they are not compassionate towards the poor.
* I strive to be compassionate and believe it should be one of the highest values for all humans (this is kind of a religious/spiritual thing though).

My main theory as to why I'm like this is that I'm a woman, so I've been socialized to be more emotional and in tune with my emotions. I also have read lots of fiction since I was a child (supposedly this makes you more empathetic), and have struggled with depression, which forced me to observe my feelings. I also have taken plenty of shrooms and MDMA, which I believe gave me a mellowness about life among other qualities that other INTJs stereotypically lack.

However, despite this, my two best friends who are INFJs seem a bit too feely for me. One of them said that he once felt like crying because of all the bad things in the world. While I am upset by peoples' lack of compassion, I don't feel like expressing emotions over it because there's nothing I can do about it, and so it would be a waste of time and energy. I love these two, but from my perspective, they feel too much sometimes when they don't have to and could be conserving their mental energy.

Of course, individuals vary, so maybe all of this isn't totally out of line for an INTJ. My other source of confusion is the cognitive functions.

I know I'm very Te because I LOVE efficiency and planning and tend towards it even without thinking, but I feel like my Ti is developed as well. The thing about finding the right words to express an idea is VERY me, and I love determining sub-categories and sub-principles. I also enjoy determining nuances that differentiate concepts and LOVE having labels for things (such as sexualities or religious beliefs). 

I don't think I'm Fe because I just don't really care about people. I'm just not really interested in them unless I think they could be useful/interesting to me, and only after that, I will bother to get to know them further and eventually come to care very deeply for them. I highly value politeness and good manners, but I think small talk and the flirting/dating game are total wastes of time. I don't adjust my behavior to others unless it's a survival thing (ex: the workplace). The Fe characteristics apply to me when I'm with people I care about, otherwise it's not me at all.

The INTJ's Fi quality allows me to determine if people are fake or good or whatever, though to be honest, I don't fully understand what it is. I do know that I have very clear internal values and I judge everything I come across based on them.

Anyway, in conclusion, I am pretty sure I am INTJ, but my emotional life and the fact that I've got Te as well as Ti are things I'd like to explore further, and if you guys have any input or experiences to share, I would appreciate your time (also I'm thankful if you got this far, haha).

 I was wondering if you guys experience what I do when it comes to empathy... I basically do everything I can to understand and have empathy for others until I literally cannot anymore (I will keep on being there for someone until they finally do something that I can't make an excuse for or re-frame in a positive way) and then I finally snap and I place distance between me and that person... And I know that setting healthy boundaries is a good thing but I still worry... Doing everything I can to understand others is how I cope with what happens around me basically and that's something I have thought about a lot recently because I'm starting to think that it isn't actually helping me live a better life. Isn't this really just me needlessly worrying re-framed? Is there a better way? I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out.

 Has anyone else dealt with this kind of thing? How do you guys manage your intense (and eerily accurate) radar for reading and understanding others, particularly their pain? I end up worrying about people a lot, even though I know that they can take care of themselves (and they usually do), lol.

I didn't really start putting pieces of myself together until I was 17 when I met my core group of 3-4 best friends. Getting close to these friends was like a mental revolution to me as I was able to express all of the random and nonsensical thoughts that I spurted out.

I've been unemployed and living at home with my parents for the past year and everything in my life has just been wrong.  I'm constantly making the wrong decisions (logistic and planning skills are now nonexistent) and saying the wrong things and am easily irritable and hypersensitive (I'm convinced my friends hate me).  Usually I could fight the suckiness of my situation by working out, but for the past two months or so, I don't have the motivation to and I'm getting consumed by what feels like a perpetual grip.  Although my life has been stagnant, its about to change as  will be moving states for grad school (is this a good idea, or should I stay instate for school and void the stress of moving?), but the grip-like symptoms haven't left me.

How do I get out of this?  They usually say that the cure is to spend some time alone to recharge, but I have been really isolated from my friends this year and my parents only talk to me to criticize me, so I try to shut them out.

I am also left handed. But I'm so wierd when it comes to that because sometimes I'm not sure if that's how I should classify myself.

I write with my left hand, I ain't bad with my right hand either.

I eat (I hold the fork/spoon) in my right hand. But when I'm eating something like bread with nutella I have to hold the bread in my left hand.

I shoot the basketball with my right hand (I can't do shit with my left, I look like a 5 year old) but I kick the football (soccer ball) with my left leg and trying to kick it with my right leg results in complete fuck up and probably tripping myself.

I've always been bad in art classes... Drawing things just is not my thing. But my handwriting was always praised as being too beautiful for a man.

Math and physics.. my nightmare. Geometry? I fucking loved that.

I can go for weeks being mostly alone and isolated. But then come days when I need to talk and party my ass off.

I love when things are in order but then again when stuff is laying everywhere in a huge mess I know exactly where the thing I need is! My mom sometimes comes into my room, sees the mess and fixes it. Then I feel totally lost and confused. Few days later I hate it when mess starts appearing again and few days into the mess I am used to it. Cycle repeats.

My friends turn to me for relationship advices and they praise me for being so good but on my end, my love life sucks.

I just can't hate on different genres of music and movies. I have a music player on my computer playing all my songs in shuffle mode. It goes from trance to rap, house, heavy metal, country, folk, soundtrack, dance, classical, 40's &amp; 50's music all the way to 90's and 00's. Oriental music? No problem. Some old school french bal-musette? No problem! Listening to scottish bagpipes or soviet red army choir? Jazz? Funk? Soul? Reggae? Harder styles of electronic music? I just can't hate a music genre. If a song is good I'll listen to it, even if it's a Justin Bieber song. Hey, Rebecca Black's friday was so bad it was actually good in some way. And then I'm off to listen to some Sabaton, Armin van Buuren or Rakim. 

That's why I hate questions like ""What music do you listen to?"". And when I say everything they imagine like pop and rock. No! I mean literally everything!

It's same with movies. I can sit through a tear jerking drama (yes, I'm emotional), heavy war action, horror, cartoons, comedy, old classic movies... It just doesn't matter!

And because of all this, I've been called wierd, unique, unusual, etc. by people. I don't mind.. maybe I even like it. Maybe that's why I can't find a girlfriend.. I'm looking for one who shares all this... One I can listen to everything with. Watch every movie. I dont' like it when people are narrow-minded.

I'm not the kind of guy who shoves you his CDs into your face yelling ""LISTEN TO THIS, AWESOME ALBUM!"" But if someone asks about a particular song or artist/band/movie, I'll gladly show and explain them.

Despite my introverted and social shyness personality I chose an interesting profession. Ambulance nurse (it's an european thing). No problem with seeing tons of blood, severed limbs, shit, piss, puke and awful smells. But seeing an animal hurt or being tortured? Can't stand it! Fills me with rage!

I've posted some on here about it, but for the sake of my own mental health I won't go too deep into it. I've had to deal with a deluge of negative feelings, including betrayal, fear, and confusion, and I'm beginning to come out of some of the more difficult parts of depression.

Unfortunately, the situation isn't as cut and dry as I would have liked it to be and my initial response to the news was erratic. I acted on a lot of emotions that, in retrospect, I realize I shouldn't have and that caused a lot of added stress. Even so, I've begun to realize how little I understand about my emotions. This sub has helped me quite a bit (especially posts like [one](http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1eweue/does_anyone_else_feel_like_there_is_this_demon/), [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1evn75/anyone_else_here_obsessed_with_the_reasoning/), and [three](http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1etwxm/hi_first_time_posting_here_i_sometimes_have_a/)). So thanks, I guess.

Today, I stumbled upon some research done by psychologists about a subset of the population they call Highly Sensitive Persons (HSPs). While I want to pause and remark that I'm not into labeling myself, it's pretty ludicrous how well I fit into that category. According to some of the articles I've read, around 15-20% of the world are HSPs and they basically have a predisposition towards being very sensitive to both external and internal stimuli.

I've realized that many of my characteristics as both an INFJ and as an HSP affect my life in drastic ways that I often don't understand. I know now that I need to work towards understanding that. I've been blessed with the opportunity to go to a therapist through school for the next few weeks, so I have been trying to take advantage of that and it is a habit that I would like to continue.

Looking back, I'm not entirely sure what my purpose was in posting this. More than likely, it's a cathartic exercise and a hunch that I'm not the only one on /r/infj that this may help. At least for me, it's nice to know that I'm not broken and may have something to say when I'm told to ""get over it"" or develop a ""thicker skin.""

I am more self aware and I try to be as much as possible. I can talk myself away from things most of the time, but even so, worry and anxiety show through. It seems to be most prevalent at work because I dont have too many outlets. 

I spend most of my time in my office working on electronics and occasionally have to go into the world with other people which is fine. I consider that an outlet. 

My problem comes when I have situations of uncertainty and I start to over analyze things and I get negative and spin down into a state of anxiousness where I feel like I might explode. I cant sit still, or work, or  function well sometimes. My only solution right now has been to take off on a drive, but I shouldnt do that all the time. Occasionally I will lay down on the floor and sort of meditate for a minute, but that could get me in trouble too. 

Note that this is not all the time and I dont think I should be put on anti depressants or whatever. I dont want to be on them at least. 

I will say that since I have ""figured myself out"" or rather learned that I am an INFJ and what that means and understand why I do and think what I do. My life has changed a bit. I used to take naps every day after work because I was so exhausted, but for some reason I do not now. I am definitely able to keep the anxiety down, but sometimes its still inevitable. 

Again Im sure I am preaching to the choir, but if you have tips I would love to hear them. Otherwise Ill have to call the Therapist and actually follow through this time. 

I think perhaps today is one of those days where I am working myself into a hole. You know. One of those days where youve been going good and you tell yourself shits gonna be alright and then you remember all the shit that isnt alright and then you freak out until youre not sure about anything.

For the past few days I've been having violent outbursts. I'll punch a wall or slam a door or throw just about anything I can get my hands on and scream until my throat burns. I've also taken to punching/slapping myself in moments of extreme duress.

I've been grappling with the disintegration of my very small family unit, the erosion of many close friendships and a tumultuous romantic relationship, on top of all of my regular worries and stressors. 

My normal state is one of alleviation, mindfulness and trying to help everyone I come across. I've adapted many Buddhist principles into my life, and I love to clean and cook, I don't honestly want to break my things or hurt anyone. But I know an hour or so from now something that I'm stewing over will flare up in my mind and I'll try to destroy something.

Does anybody else have these kind of reactionary tendencies? What does one do to keep these explosive feelings in check? How can I find some semblance of solace to make it through this weekend?",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1c8j6c,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1c8j6c/explosive_outbursts/,

It's helped me in so many realms of my life, not the least of which being the romantic relationships I've been blessed to find myself in.  I can ""get"" what my partner is trying to say and understand him deeply.  And there's almost nothing better than feeling that kind of connection with another.

But there's (at least) one aspect of this that I struggle with: I sometimes can't separate my own feelings from the feelings of a guy I'm with.  This is especially problematic when I'm seeing someone who's more into me than I'm into him.  I feel I am simply a mirror, reflecting his own affection to him.  Or that I am drowning in a sea of his emotion, and I have to fight, gasping, for a breath of my own.

It's gotten me into trouble before.  Like the guy from Kentucky whom I started talking with online, and who eventually flew down to see me.  I realized partway through his visit that he was putting a lot more into this than I was, and that I was being dishonest by reflecting his affection back at him.  It scared me to realize this, and when we had that conversation, he convinced me to try a FWB situation.  Like so many other INFJs I've read about here, FWB does not work out for me.

I just found this subreddit. A classmate of mine was interested in finding out everyone's type, and thus I recently found out I was an INFJ. Over the past week or so I have been reading more about the personality type and I am amazed at how well people have described things I have a hard time describing myself. I even sent some descriptions to my boyfriend so that he would ""get"" me a little better haha.

Back to the question at hand. I have noticed that I have started to have anger issues over things I think should really be trivial. The only reason I bring them up now is because there is a chance you all may have advice to help, and maybe you understand. Basically, I have issues with people constantly correcting me, especially when what I said wasn't wrong to begin with or doesn't really warrant said correction.

For example: you say the sky looks really blue today. Someone chimes in with, ""Well, actually, it is more of a periwinkle."" Is that really necessary? Was I really so wrong I needed to be corrected? It may be who I hang out with, but I feel like I am constantly told I am wrong. People say things all the time that are incorrect, or they use the wrong word for something, but I GET what they mean and I just don't think pointing out to someone the subtle differences between what they said and what the mean is really helpful or productive. If you understand me, can we just move on? Also, why do people feel like they are such authorities on everything? No one knows everything, I'm the first to admit that.

Anyways, I know this has devolved into a rant-like post. I feel like people are so free with their words that they don't consider all of the things tumbling out of their mouths. I, on the other hand, rarely contribute to a conversation unless I know what I am talking about or can back up something I am going to say. So, when someone ""corrects"" me, I can't help but feel slighted, especially when the correction really isn't adding anything or the correction is wrong to begin with. Another example is I will be studying with friends, I say something, they tell me I am wrong, I doubt myself, then I come to find out that I was in fact correct. It is just such a mindfuck for me. I start doubting myself and feeling stupid for saying something incorrect, then come to find out these confident people are the ones that were wrong. Then I feel angry because how dare you correct someone if you aren't sure yourself?

The second half of my title deals with me not liking advice. Of course, if I am asking you about something, I want to know. I hate it when people feel like they have to constantly give me advice or tell me what to do. I am a very considerate person and I think of all options before I make a decision. I guess I feel like there is a lack of confidence in my ability to make a decision soundly. I especially hate when people give advice in the form of a command, like their way is the only way. 

Sigh, maybe the past few weeks have just been long because I was studying intensely. Maybe I am dealing with some other issues I have yet to identify. I know this isn't the first time I have had these feelings, so I need to learn a way to handle them the next time the show up.

Anyone else relate or have advice? I'm so frustrated about being frustrated. ",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1bnh8c,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1bnh8c/unnecessary_corrections_and_unsolicited_advice/,

Don't get me wrong, I'm a pretty happy guy, I've got a small group of really good friends, I have a number of serious hobbies, and I'm holding down a good job; it's not a ""help I never get out"" sort of thing.  They're all married or close to it so they don't always have the random blocks of free time that I do (I'm single) and don't always share my creative or expressive impulses.  

So, how do all of you, especially those of you with a more extroverted bent, get out there and see some of the amazing variety of people?

Perhaps I just feel like this is similar to horoscopes in the sense that everyone can relate with any of the categories as long as they initially go into it with the preconceived notion that they **will** fall into said category.  Confirmation bias?

At the same time, though, I think to myself ""well, does it even matter whether I am well categorized relative to the other types as long as I find some other people who can identify with some of my ideals?""

Sometimes I pretty much feel like a fascist dictator when I've reached an opinion about something- bad art, insane restaurant decorating, you know what I mean... In fact, I think I've straight up pissed off my INFP (EX)-boyfriend for even having the gall to *have* opinions....

 Maybe it's because we depend so much on the mysterious processes of the iNtuitive iNtuition, and, I think probably also, because we as INFJs put so much effort and consideration into the opinions we do form?

Anyway, feel free to share your experiences with humility, I for one, think sometimes my strong opinions, or my strong extroverted feelings, have probably drowned out other peoples...which is ironic because as INFJs we're so freaking preoccupied by others' emotions...

There was a lot of conflict within my immediate and extended family ever since I was in the womb and, looking back, I can clearly see that my heart was soaking it all up like a sponge.

That is not the first time people complain that I don't care about them anymore and they just don't understand I feel bad like hell. 

It is like I am not allowed to have feelings. (one friend actually told me I am not more as a pet when I show my feelings)  Sometimes when it is really bad the people complain that I retreat myself to recover and complain I don't care about them and try to force me to help them. 

And I can't help selflessly anymore, because I think it is meaningless. For the worst I completly desintressed in people in the real world. Actually I don't care whether I hurt them or not and always say what I think and I think why should I care when they don't care.

Now I thought I could deal with this. I thought I had internalized the fact that she's just one of those interrupting-types, and that she never really means to hurt my feelings or be disrespectful, and indeed, she probably really doesn't mean to.

But somehow even with all this, I still find myself incredibly offended and frustrated to the point of pouty-silence (Ah yes, I am not above it...).

Right now I've all but completely detached from her, but obviously I **must** deal with this situation if we're going to remain friends, and considering that tomorrow is our new move-in date, I have to, or I *feel* I have to, provide her with some explanation for my aloofness...

What should I say, what do I do? Should I just bury my resentment at her behavior and try to convince myself she doesn't mean to hurt me?
And if I talk to her, how do you tell someone you feel like they've been rude socially, especially when you know that the problem at hand arises out of your own incredibly high standards for yourself?

It occurs to me that this happens much more when she drags me out to do things with groups of people, and maybe I'm just an inept recluse who doesn't remember what socializing in a group is? 
Then again, these are all new people and new friends, so I don't exactly feel like I can relax entirely and I don't know, necessarily, that what I'm saying is understood or appreciated...

Finally, do any of you other infjs feel this **self-conscious** in social situations? I pretty much anticipate coming off as the eccentric or the weird-thinker, and I don't know if it's being the 1% of the population, or what...

There are ideas sloshing around and emotions getting carried away at every turn.

Progress is only made to the extent that I can slow down the never ending churn. It’s temporary. The current picks back up with whatever is there and makes a mess of thoughts and emotions again and again.

I try to catalogue and put away some of these things but something always leads them back to the whirlpool.

It’s probably because the whirlpool is inherently negative. The faster it pulls things in, the more negative it becomes. When I can slow it, I feel the happiest—the safest.

It’s my brain naturally behaving like it does but it conspires against my long term plans.

My long term plans are formed miles from the whirlpool with no regard for its needs and strength. The long term goals (marriage, career, etc.) don’t make time for dealing with the mess created by the almost magnetic pull towards the center of swirling thoughts. But I am constantly called to tame the current; to prevent it from getting out of hand and taking over.

Of course, since I haven’t set aside time to do this maintenance, the only time I’m called to tend to it is when it’s already stronger than it should ever get.

I try to fix the broken cycle of negativity but it’s so strong. It pulls me in as soon as I think I’ve fixed it. It’s negative and a trickster. It makes me think I’ve won and lets me feel that for days on end before showing its ugly face and reminding me that I can’t kill it.

But maybe, just maybe, I can change the current. Instead of counter-clockwise and counterproductive, I need to find the balance and flip the switch. I can use the churning thoughts and emotions in the productive and positive clockwise motion. It can help move me towards my future goals rather than winding me the opposite way away from them.

Of course, this will be a constant effort. But it will be fruitful. Instead of cleaning up a Chernobyl sized atomic meltdown, I will be gently stocking a wood stove—careful to keep it going but not to let the fire get out of control.

I performed a quick search in your subreddit with ""religion"" and ""religious"" placed in the query, and did not come up with much.

Personally, I am a member of the Rationalist temperament (NT), and I believe it is pretty well established that most our population does not follow any organized religion; many are atheists, agnostics, pantheists, some buddhists (who are more attracted to the lifestyle) here and there, etc.; and those few that do happen to follow an organized religion often seem to have their own interpretations of it. I want to make it clear that I am not trying to start one of those annoying typical atheist shitstorm circlejerks seen at r/atheism, but rather am simply curious to see if there is a common underlying theme to the spiritual beliefs of your personality type.

In addition, I would like to add that I am very fond and often get along well with people of the INFP and INFJ personality types. We often experience the same difficulties of being pariahs in a superficial and deeply flawed society; and you are generally intelligent and caring people, who tend to share similar world views as me, albeit reached from a more humanist pathway vs. the scientific/logical pathway that I often take.

I manipulate them slightly, but they mostly have a life of their own. It's like dreaming while awake, and after a while in this trance like state, this vision gets really clear and reality seems to fade into the darkness of my mind. I become aware of the air surrounding my ears and I feel a presence float past them. My mind clears up and my head feels refreshed.

I enjoy reading about physics, black holes, astronomy, 4th dimensional geometry, sacred geometry, etc. Recently my 'visions' have involved molecular structures of common day things and made up molecular structures.

TL;DR I daydream when I'm bored and I find what I day dream about interesting.

In the folding of space and of divine glory I was sitting in that beautiful place between places, The Journey...just being.  I inhaled and was satisfied by the chill air full of star-dust, rushing into aching lungs that had since birth choked on ghosts. 

 I knew what it is to Be.

Does anybody here have a history of mental illness in addition to being an INFJ? How do you think mental illness has affected your expression of different cognitive functions? 

I'm particularly interested in bipolar and autism-spectrum disorders, but other experiences are most welcome*. Bipolar seems to lend itself pretty naturally to the high-voltage emotional build-up/release of INFJs. I certainly feel like I am much more open to overload when I'm on a manic swing, as much as I gravitate towards others for emotional fulfillment.

Autism spectrum (particularly high functioning or Asperberger's) would seemingly contradict INFJ's emphasis on empathy. However, there's recently been a push to understand autism as based in empathetic overload that is too difficult to express, instead of disassociation from empathy. I see autism-spectrum symptoms as lending themselves to a disproportionate reliance on INFJ's tertiary introverted thinking function (as opposed to auxiliary extroverted feeling). This is because masking INFJ tendencies with hyper-analytic, INTP-like observation can help us learn the patterns of our social systems well enough to adjust for autism-related social difficulties. 

Anyway, any experiences with mental illness are most welcome. I'm interested in this because it helps reveal the gradations between the binary MBTI types. It also could offer insight into how differential _use_ of functions can shape the way our cognitive tendencies continue to develop.

So for a quick introduction -- I'm new here and I just recently got into personality profiling. I've taken the MBTI personality tests in the past and I've always gotten INFJ, but I'd read the short descriptions at the end and say, *okay yeah that's me, but I want to dig deeper and no, I won't pay to learn more about what I already know about myself.* 

Then, a few months ago I stumbled upon [this INFJ profile](http://personalityjunkie.com/the-infj/) that not only told me what I'm like, but *why* I'm like that. This completely took me by surprise and was incredibly exciting. I felt as though I'd found the owners manual to myself and how I operate. Since then, I've started to become more aware of what I do in my day to day life and how I feel in my interactions with others. 

This brings me to how I felt when I was shopping yesterday because I was reminded of how I used to really hate shopping in my teens (which, as a teenage girl, was very weird to most people). And I suddenly realized why I hated shopping so much back then -- if I was shopping and a sales associate helped me, I would always end up buying something I **didn't want** because I felt like they'd be hurt if I didn't buy whatever it was they were helping me with. Now this person didn't have to be the best salesperson in the world, they just had to be nice &amp; kind and I'd feel bad if I didn't buy anything. Obviously, I've grown a lot and now I can say that it isn't exactly what I want and walk away feeling okay, but when I was younger I could've never done that. 

So I'm wondering if any other INFJs out there have experienced similar feelings while shopping. Did you feel compelled to purchase something you didn't want because you didn't want to make the salesperson feel bad? I guess I'm wondering is this an INFJ thing or just a me thing?

1371755068.0,7,self.infj,1gqu08,INTP wondering if I could be INFJ,dpitch40,8,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1gqu08/intp_wondering_if_i_could_be_infj/,"To make a long story short, I have pretty much always tested as an INTJ. (Though I have taken the test I use so many times and know it so well that I don't trust its accuracy too much) A few months ago, I starting thinking I was more of an INTP; this type seemed a better fit because I really didn't see myself as highly practical, hard-nosed, or competence-focused as INTJs are often described, and I realized I seemed to resemble an INTP more in many ways. I'm highly intuitive and good at solving problems--reasoning nonlinearly about, and making sense of abstract systems, and drawing many conclusions of varying certainty levels from limited data while keeping my theories open to new evidence (if that makes any sense). But the problems I solve are more often abstract than practical (theology especially) and I'm not naturally inclined to share my thought process with anyone else unless asked, much less impose it on anyone for the sake of efficiency. It seemed like a textbook case of INTP to me.

Then the other day I was looking at descriptions of the [cognitive functions](http://www.the16types.info/vbulletin/content.php/213-MBTI-Descriptions-of-cognitive-functions-from-various-sources) linked from /r/intp and realized that though Ne did resemble me, Ni did far more, better than any other function, even my Ti. Funnily enough, Ni isn't supposed to be one of the functions of an INTP. I took a cognitive functions test that confirmed my suspicions and asked on /r/intp for advice. The three biggest lines of suggestion were:

* You're an ISTP. (I think I can pretty safely rule this one out; N is the descriptor I am most certain about of them all)
* You're really an INTJ. (Same problems as before)
* You're an INFJ.

This last one took me by surprise as I've always thought of myself as a T, but it is the only other type besides ISTP that has both Ni and Ti and it started making increasing amounts of sense. Assuming this is the case, I think I've been prevented from seeing it by some stereotypes I've believed about INFJs and Fs in general: that they're soft and mushy, overly sentimental/emotional, outwardly warm and compassionate, totally focused on feelings (theirs and others') over facts, etc. I'm sure you could explain why these are false. Because of another long story, I've largely denied my feeling side and focused on rationality for the past few years, resulting in a more developed Ti function than Fe, but in terms of how I make practical decisions and relate to others I tend to be more structured and person-focused than I usually think in my cloud of introversion.

As I considered the possibility that I'm an INFJ more, I realized I'm not interested in ideas for the sake of ideas, as seems to be the case with INTPs, so much as I am for the sake of people and how these ideas or concepts affect them either by their implications or simply by their being believed (this can be a big deal with theology). I'm interested in understanding ideas *in the context* of the people who hold them, not in a vacuum. Does this sound more F to anyone?

I want to share some ideas about life with you to think about and see where you stand. These aren't so much life-lessons because well, I'm only 24 and I have a lot more living to do before I can consider myself possessing life lessons.

Nevertheless, being aware of what we talk about from different perspectives is for me something creative, energising, and leads me to great insight.

To that end, consider not so much:

""What is the meaning of life?"" but instead ""what meaning is my life unfolding into?""

""INFJ"" as a static label, but instead as the first point of further development towards wholeness. Consider personality as a spectrum, and you possess far more potential than you may realise at this present moment.  

As a very quick reminder, 

* I-E is where we get our energy from

* N-S is how we perceive the world and take in information

* F-T is how we prefer to make decisions (do we go to the head or the heart space?)

* J-P is our orientation towards the external world. 

All of these energies are available to us. Strange, isn't it? But very few personality theories are static. 

Not so much ""high esteem"" or ""low esteem"" but instead ""esteem"" towards yourself. There is no need for labels, just awareness. Let other people attach high or low. When that happens, they can't give you low esteem, because you already have esteem which opens up the gateway to others.

That you don't need to put what you know and see deeply into words. It is fine as it is. You know in your knowing. Sit with it. Hold it. The opportunity to voice those deep answers come in their own time, not ours.

There is no either/or but instead both/and. You have both logic and intuition; both mind and heart; both analysis and synthesis; both order and creativity. Each has their place, and you have the opportunity to develop what has been underdeveloped, and then to bring all of who you are into a balance greater than the sum of its parts.

Life is in the living of it. There is pressure for a plan, for a schema, but a balance of knowing what you want and stepping into the unknown world unleashes a strange strength - living your life allows you to grow especially into things uncertain to your inner logic: You cannot think your way into a new way of being.

From what I read online this is pretty typical ""INFJ"" thing to do. That is great. Let us all be miserable and talk about how we look like cold, heartless bastards. OMG my feelings are so deep etc, etc. I dont have time for all that. 

My girlfriend / the girl I am talking to (we dont have a specific title) is an INTJ. She and I talked about 2 years ago and things didnt work for a lot of reasons, mostly because we werent really mature enough to understand each other and have a healthy relationship. This time around we are a lot better with things. One of the problems she cited the first time around was that I did not show enough emotion. 

At the time I was completely shocked. ME? I DONT SHOW ENOUGH EMOTION? I have more emotions than anyone else I know. How the hell is this possible? I am crazy about this girl and she thinks I dont like her. Upon looking at things I was pretty reserved, not very affectionate at all, and didnt even verbally express things. This caused her to shell up and myself even more so. 

This time around I decided to make a better effort at saying what was on my mind and not thinking about it or worrying about it. That has gotten me further than I anticipated. 

Anyway, the other day she took me to Whole Foods for the first time. I had never been to a store like that and it was pretty overwhelming. The restaurant-type area, the fresh produce, new products, just everything was pretty cool. I was having a good time taking everything in and following her around for grocery shopping. 

I told her to ask me any time I was outwardly confusing or looked upset. She asked me how I was feeling at lunch and I take that to mean that I look troubled. 

So after we get food and were in line she apologizes for putting me through the act of grocery shopping. I am pretty confused. She said I didnt look like I was having a good time. That I looked a bit miserable. I understand thinking I am not excited because I never get excited about much of anything, but I most certainly wasnt upset! I was having an excellent time. 

At that point I just felt bad and awkward. Trying to think about how to show how I felt on the outside. It seemed kind of impossible to do without seeming completely fake and wrong if even then. 

I brought up the whole situation and said that it made me worry I dont show enough emotion all the time / unintentionally give her the wrong idea about ""US"". 

She said she feels like this about half of the time we are hanging out. That I am just completely unable to be read. I asked some of my friends and they said the same thing. 

I know that sometimes I shell up intentionally, but not with her. I do have a difficult time expressing how I feel about her sometimes though. I explained it like this.

I will tailspin when asked about how I feel sometimes just because I am expected to put words together quickly about emotions and emotions are hard to explain. More than that, say we have a feels scale of 1-10 and I feel at a 10, but I accidentally explain it as though I am an 8 or 6 or something. I really dont want to explain my emotions unless they are going to come off accurately. I know she gets frustrated with this because I will stall and dance around trying to articulate things. She feels like I am being insincere or holding back from her. This is NOT the case. 

That hyperbole and a half comic that came up the other day pretty well explains myself for the past couple years. I never really looked at life as being depressed, though. I just figured I was blah and that was it. In the last month or so I figured out my proper type and learned a lot about myself in searching for answers and whatever. I figured out what I want out of life. I figured out that a lot of what I do is normal as an INFJ at least. I found her. 

Lately I have been feeling some pretty strong emotions. The first one would be anger. I get REALLY angry pretty easy now. I have almost no patience for bullshit and inconsiderate people. I get hypersensitive to everything around me even the guy punching numbers in the ATM. Every little number tone makes me angry for instance. 

The next would be just a feeling of calmness. I am not depressed about the world, or life, or whatever really. I am okay with being home and just cleaning or doing mundane tasks (mind you I have to be doing something productive) and I would say I am generally at peace. 

I find it easier to get up for work in the morning, easier to put effort into things (cooking food and doing work around the house, etc) I dont take naps after work any more, but I dont get any extra sleep either. 

The past couple days especially I have noticed myself laughing pretty hard. Two occasions I caught myself laughing probably too hard at things like a youtube video. I dont really emote much even when something is hilarious, but I was kinda worried that I was laughing so hard. 

The last and most notable feeling is probably the bond I feel with her. I would say this is most definitely love. I promised her I would try to get things down and explain them to her, my feelings that is. I guess that is why I am here. 

I have never felt so deeply for anyone person in my life. I am absolutely crazy about her. Not in an unhealthy way either. I tried to explain things last night, but I am pretty sure that is how things came off because she told me to be myself and quit trying to please her, but that is exactly what I am trying so hard at. I feel like I finally have myself figured out and I feel like I can be just myself with her. I have been trying to be open about my feelings and explain them to her often. It seems to be doing somewhat okay because she asked me the other night after drinking if I was in love with her. I told her that yes I was. I told her later that I did mean it ahd she said she knew that. She then asked how I knew. I have never been more sure of anything in my life and I tried to briefly explain how I knew, but how am I supposed to sum that up? I wish I could give her a box with my emotions in it so that she could be blown away with understanding (actually that might be a bit scary, but fuck it.) I do know that in some of our  harder times I could feel this welling inside of me as I held her that felt like an indescribable mix of excitement, fear, care, and just raw emotion. A totally new emotion that I can seriously only describe as love. A feeling that at that moment she was all that mattered and that she cared about me and that everything would be okay because we had each other. 

I could probably go on and on, but my point is that I am pretty sure I feel things inside much more than I reciprocate, and it surely doesnt show on the outside. I figure there are probably times where I am looking into her eyes feeling something and she thinks I am having a bad day &gt;__&lt; 

A lot of the things I feel with her are new, and I cant say I have really ever had to express my deeper feelings to anyone before. I need to figure out how to do that. Not just the deeper ones, but the basic ones too. I am overwhelmed in a good way, but I really dont want to fuck things up with her. I cant. 

Sorry for the novel; and even if nobody reads it, I at least sorta got it out and that helps a bit. 


Edit: I feel the need to add that she is quite good at understanding me. We are on the same page most of the time. We have similar thought processes and reach the same conclusions and if I am really troubled about something she ""knows"". This is about the times where she doesnt know. She is a thinking type and I am a feeling type and I think that is the issue here in addition to us just being tough to crack.

- I feel like a better person around children. They're not so self-conscious yet. That's good for people. 
- I'm very organized and love planning things. 
- I need to be around people to be happy. I am extremely introverted, so I'm wondering how it would feel to be around so many people all day, but it seems like you'd be kind of separate while still interacting, because you're in charge. I like that.

NFJs are perfect for dedication towards the growth and betterment of another human being, (i.e. the counselor that doesn’t give up hope). However, a strong penchant for single minded focus paired with powerful  emotions and deep inner dreams can leave NFJs at a bit of a loss when they find it hard to pin down exactly what they want, make complex decisions,  recognize how to achieve what they need and have inner stability. This is where the NTP comes in.

  NTPs are the playful geniuses of the world. Everything is an experiment, a new possibility to be explored and with quick judgment, they can solve complex puzzles and piece together new theories about life. Keirsey’s description of the INTP and ENTP as the Architect and Inventor, respectively, seems very apt when describing these optimistic system builders. This optimism isn’t without great cause though: An NTP may see a single flower growing on war-torn dead land and feel hope, because they know a flower could repopulate the lands as opposed to the symbolic joy an NFP may feel.

  NTPs have the power to teach and show an NFJ how to utilize this ability to evaluate new situations fairly and accurately use their logic to make good decisions. NFJs strong dedication to cause may be revealed to be misplaced and better warranted elsewhere. Many NFJs fail to realize their sense of what they want and need to realize goals is often as weak/under-nurtured as their critical thinking, and how the individual interprets it will gradually grow with time and self-understanding. The quick witted NTP offers an out to misguided thinking with confidence in thought and choice exploration.

  So how can you start? Try to start your day with a different perspective, a new set of goals, or think of your everyday conventions in a different manner. Perhaps emulate any NTP friends or characters you admire. Active imagination – becoming the star of your own story – may help you find out what the toxic choices in your life are in the meantime while you build your skills, through the symbolism NFJs seem to grasp. If something makes you uncomfortable there, chances are it has a real life parallel, or a change in perception is required. I recommend sitting down with relaxing music on and letting your mind wander; visualize yourself in a different world and explore.

I'm going to get right to the point. I want to know how many of you are ""spiritual"" and have had experiences that some people would call ""supernatural"" or ""psychic"".

I kind of resent the tern ""supernatural"" because there isn't anything supernatural about it. It's perfectly natural. It's right in front of you.

My thoughts? All iterations of material reality and consciousness are inherently linked. In that realization a door opens, and you can go as far as you wish... Consciousness influences and is reflected in material reality at all times. It's simply a matter of degree in regards to how strong that influence is, and how much a person realizes it at any given moment.

Some of you have probably experienced precognition, synchronicity (can be understood as ""serendipity""). There are many other tools by which a persons scope is expanded though.

I also want to be a professor one day, and I love being in an academic environment with the rest of the profs. I love learning from them and engaging them. Everything here is great so far, apart from a few inter-personal issues that are starting to get under my skin. 

My office consists of two different departments sharing a suite, one of which I am the official admin for. When I interviewed for this gig I was told that I would be working mostly alone, and that the office was  mine to run and organize as I so chose. This excited me terribly, as I really hate being subject to conversations if I'm not in the mood.  However, now the other department has moved another admin, the same level as me, into my office. She's the sweetest girl I've ever met, she's totally nice and helpful and really good at her job, but here's the thing. SHE TALKS ALL FUCKING DAY. I mean everything that pops into her head comes out of her mouth. I can't focus on any tasks, because she's always saying something, regardless of whether it is related to our job.  I can feel myself getting anxious before I even walk in and start the coffee. By three o'clock, I am starting to feel murderous. I am so stressed out from the constant chatter that I don't know what to do, and I don't want to put myself in a position of hostility in a new job.  Like I said, I really like her, and I feel this need to empathize and discuss all of her issues with her ( like we do) but I can't help but really really hate that she just won't stop talking.

I was reading the profile of the INFP and i felt that a lot of things with it resounded with me.. Mostly the yearn for knowledge to help make patterns and the intense Fi emotions..

This also links up with the fact that in both tests I took, I only scored 1% into judging on one and like 2% onto perceiving on another.. Looking through profiles I do feel a much stronger resonance to INFJ, I think that the tests may have swayed me more towards to P because I'm too lazy to plan things.

Is it possible to be in the centre of the spectrum? To have the intensity of the Ni that I feel so strongly, and yet the thirst and widening of the Ne? But still having the Ni take the Ne and converge it to a single point but from a wider opening? Or to have Ne that thinks and theorises aloud but.. About Ni aspects, my dreams, my creativity, my depth, my alienation, my differences, my understanding of my surroundings.. 

Is it possible to have both the understanding of how everyone around you is feeling, to work around that, to want to help people, to see two people in everyone, and yet feel so intensely yourself, and to have your decisions funded by past experiences that were personal to you? 

I honestly feel very uncategorised because I feel that I genuinely identify with all 4 functions, in a weird interconnection, as though they all work together to achieve my result... Although, I do have a completely absent Si, but I even get the tug of war between Se/Ni or Te/Fi... Like.. I feel both of them!? 

Honestly I'm at a loss. Help :(

EDIT:: I may have misunderstood this for Ne: *INFJs utilize their Fe to express their thoughts, feelings, opinions, and grievances. Fe gives voice and shape to INFJs’ feelings and intuitions. In many cases, INFJs do not know fully understand the nature of an Ni insight until given the opportunity to verbalize it. They may have a hunch or a gut feeling, but the content of the intuition can remain somewhat nebulous until it is expressed via their Fe. Assuming they have not been severely censored in their upbringing, INFJs are generally happy to share their feelings and perspectives. In fact, given the right opportunity, INFJs will often talk at length about their feelings and intuitions. Unlike FP types, who generally prefer a more dialogical format, INFJs are inclined toward monologues, which allow them to fully flesh out their ideas on a certain topic.*

She agreed and we got lunch and wound up talking for two solid hours! We clicked quite well and I would like to be able to spend more time with her and maybe actually become a real friend to her.  


The problem is, I have been initiating all contact with her! Every text, fb message, whatever, has been sent by me first. To be honest I find this frustrating, I am usually very passive when it comes to socialization. I have been reading about the infj type in order to better understand her actions (I am guessing on her type here, but I am quite sure that it's accurate) and thus far I have gathered that infj's don't like to initiate social contact, which certainly seems true in my case! 


So given all this, what are some things that I should do to befriend this girl and show her that I am trustworthy? How do most of you go about making friendships? How would your ideal friend act? What are the most important qualities you look for in a friend? Also, what are some things (as a Te) I should try to avoid?

-Low jealousy

-Pan-sexual

-Gender-queer/trans/gender fluid.

-Very distant relationships with biological family.  Prone to taking care of them.

-Financially capable.  Tends to build up large sums of money rather than shopping.  Needs few things and prefers a more ascetic lifestyle.

-Uncomfortable receiving gifts, charity, or comfort from other people.

-Keeper of stories

-Saved lives of other people, usually suicidal persons

-In conversation and fantasy, zero boundaries.  'Shocking' to converse with for most people in any authentic or honest way.

-Tendency to become what your partners desire.

-Sado-masochistic.  Can be either incredibly gentle sexually or extremely violent.  

-General distaste for psychiatrists and psychologists, stemming largely from them never having been able to improve life in any positive way for you.

I could use some help understanding whether I have underdeveloped areas or if maybe I'm not quite as INFJ as the tests indicate.

How I relate to INFJ:

* I'm always paying attention to the emotions of the people around me. The Fe in me feels pretty strong even though I have a rough time articulating.

* I crave meaning in my work. Sometimes this means I have to invent meaning. Other times it means I have to work by proxy (I'm doing this now because it means I can do that later.)

* Definitely an introvert who feels weird a lot. While I enjoy manifesting a little weirdness in front of close friends, the socially awkward or random displays are not what feels weird about me. It's that I feel like somehow my thoughts are completely nonlinear and so far deviated from the norm as to be certifiable. Since no one knows my brain, I can pretend to friends that the weird I show is as deep as it goes.

* I've noticed I have a tendency to fall in synch with all my relationships. While the ESP I feel is not as intense as those experienced by many of you, I certainly ""get on the same wavelength"" as those close to me. I don't have singular occurrences of extraordinary perception. Rather, mine are regular occurrences of *better* perception. I'm somehow a half step ahead all while following right along. (It feels like two places at once and I really have a lot of fun with it.)

* I do not live in the ""destroyer of worlds"" mindset, but I know it very well. Since I feel a strong pull to help people, it seems wrong to scorch the earth. Still, there are times it feels like a blissful alternative ...

How I don't relate to INFJ:

* I don't trust my ability to think into the future. Whether it's a manifestation of upbringing or what, I taught myself not to trust what I expect to happen. I tend to think people will react poorly or that a situation will prove intractable. If I do think about the future, I become afraid that I'm doing it all wrong and have ruined any hope of being happy. The ideals also tend to crowd in and turn my thoughts of the future into something the rational side of me sees as entirely impossible. Also, if I think about a situation too long, I tend to dwell and let it fester. I end up so upset in the contemplation that I'm derailed.

* I feel like an open book ... except I don't. This one is a little harder to explain since it's the area where I'm really unsure. I have an incredibly difficult time suppressing emotions. You'd know if I don't like you. Also, just about every emotion engenders a need to cry. The catharsis of shedding tears lets me leave the emotions in the expression of them. I have to get them out to move on.  Since being in a relationship with an INTJ, these displays have followed a pattern that he has formed into a system. While that's helpful for navigation and learning to glean what's important, it tends to be reductive. I feel as though my emotions are being simplified - but I wonder if the problem before was that I was inflating them. In short, are there really layers or am I complicating things in hopes of creating personal depth?

* Then another part of me feels like any of this simplification is done as a function of the Fe. I know the feelings of the people with whom I'm discussing emotions. So when they offer advice or insight, I can apply it because I know what they mean and where they're coming from. Still, it feels like part of the whole. These pearls of wisdom are just pieces of the necklace, not the whole string.

I'm having a hard time sorting this out and trying to make it as brief as possible (yeah, I know that's a bit INFJ of me) but I would appreciate some feedback in trying to understand what might be going on.

I don't want to be deluded in thinking that I'm a complex and special snowflake just because of a few tests and feeling some connection to what a lot of your posts have said. I'm fascinated by INFJ and how it can implode through the sheer force of its own gifts. And if I really am INFJ, I don't *want* to implode.

In complete openness, I only have a single true friend, and I've never met him. Our relationship (although extremely strong) is based through a computer as we're a country apart.

This is something that feels correct to me, but that I might have some trouble articulating.

As an INFJ, I am often motivated by my emotions... or rather, without a conscious knowledge of why I feel I must do what I must do. I feel guilty unless I do a specific thing that I view as ""what good people should do"", so on and so forth. But where does this guilt come from? 

Often times, I think it comes from my introverted intuition. At some point, I learned that good people do X thing, and, if I'm not doing it, I start to feel like I'm not a good person. I'm not formally thinking it, but that knowledge has become an essential part of who I am. My brain, without my knowledge, makes all of my decisions within a framework that contains and considers the many facts and judgments I have obtained. 

So, I have begun to abuse my Ni by deliberately seeking out knowledge that will force me to adjust my behavior into the direction that I would like to move in. In essence, I am doing my best to re-socialize myself, and I'm finding it surprisingly successful.

The first example that comes to mind involves leadership. I've always been reluctant to take on a leadership role, and I'm not sure why. I'm a tall, big male and I often get the sense that people are looking to me to make decisions. But I've always sorta felt obligated to be a bystander, or to really sheepishly lead if forced. Perhaps because I had the knowledge that other people, NOT like myself, desire leadership, I should just leave it to them to enjoy. I perceived leadership as something desirable, so denied myself it.

Then, I happened upon a bunch of reading about how leadership is the most stressful position in a group... basically, I read a whole lot about how leadership is something that actually sucks, and is not at all desirable. In fact, most people prefer being led and being told what to do (within reason/decency). This is, of coursed, based on reading which I considered to be factual and scientific. 

Because, I think, Ni can't help but confront and assimilate facts, unless you reject them, my brain redid my associations with the concept of leadership. Instead of being something that other people desired, and that I should let them have, I began to view it as a burden to be taken up for the good of others. And, therefore, good people take up leadership when in situations where others do not appear to want it, and where, logically, you can assume that you taking on the leadership role will be in the best interests of other people.

Now, obviously, any person could walk through this thought process and begin to think ""okay, hey, maybe I'll be a leader more often"". What I think makes this sort of thing especially powerful for us is that... I never tried to logic myself into taking on a leadership role. Ever since I made these new associations, I've felt emotionally driven to take on the leadership role when I should-- I feel guilty for rejecting the burden, and so I must take it on in appropriate situations.

So, through manipulating my Ni, I have changed myself into someone who is emotionally/illogically driven to perform differently than I have in the past. The mental framework that I am not consciously aware of, but that I believe makes up the most of who I am... has shifted.

Is this true for you? Is it true, but in a different sense?

I can't always read the emotions in a room, or of the people I'm speaking with if they are attempting to hide it. There could be a few reasons for this, but it makes me feel less secure in my identity as an INFJ. A couple of these reasons are my significant social anxiety (I'm often overwhelmed by social experiences) and my slight bipolar nature (most people are more emotionally stable than I am, leaving not as much to sense as often). I *do* have immense empathy when I'm told someone is feeling something. Edit: Sometimes I do get strong automatic impressions of what others are feeling, but tend to dismiss it as uncertain and have trouble knowing what is obvious to everyone or just me.


However, I am very good at reading people's personality; not in terms of classification, but more 'an impression of their essence'. It's difficult to place into words, but it's as if I know the nature of someone quickly after meeting them even if we don't speak directly. These impressions are usually pretty strong and immediate, and as a scientific-type I'm very reluctant to trust intangibles, but these impressions have yet to prove inaccurate (though I attempt to disprove them). But, I don't know if this is also considered common for INFJs, or perhaps just common for people in general! In which case, I feel painfully foolish. :(

The turmoil, tedium, gad-about.  

I lock my door upon myself,

Self from myself, most loathed of all?

Who craves for ease and rest and joys

My hollowest friend, my deadliest foe,  
My clog whatever road I go.

About a month ago, I had my finals, and I had a break up in the middle of them with a girl I thought I would marry. It was my first serious relationship, but I didn't mind once that it could possibly be my only one. Anyway, we broke up and I pushed through finals; it was the toughest month of my life. 

This whole summer, all I've been doing is studying MCAT, working at a lab, and working out. In the break up, I lost all my best friends, so I have no close friends here I can talk to or go to for support. I have friends I can hang out with, but it's not the same. No one quite understands me like my INFJ best friends used to. 

I've read tons on /r/breakups, and even posted a guide myself which has helped many people, and so I have been able to keep myself together. But today I almost completely broke down. I keep missing her so much, and wondering how she is doing. I recognize the mistakes we both made and as much as I want her to be a part of my life again, I really wish I could just move along and let her live her life (I haven't contacted/facebook stalked or anything), while I live my own. I know it's not true, but I feel like I'll never anything that matches up to what I had with her. We clicked on every level, from our basic interests to politics/religion/sexuality. I never really got a proper closure either, so maybe that is why I'm still hung up on it. I'm trying my best to move on by constantly engaging my mind in other things, but it's still very difficult. I see the potential for what this relationship could've been. I had tons of amazing plans for her this summer, and I know she would've been delighted. It's just so hard for me to snap out of it, especially with no support system available nearby. 

I feel so pressured for my MCAT, and I feel so upset that I have no close friends here. Further, I'm moving away alone to a completely new city for university (transfer) in the fall, and I'm really afraid of what I could find there. I know the experience can be amazing, but what if it's actually horrifying? All that money would be going to waste. There's no guarantee for medicine there or anything.

My parents would be disappointed in me, again. So much has changed in these past two months, and my summer is *nothing* like I thought it would be. I lost almost everyone close to me, and my life almost did a 180. Today, I cried for like an hour after coming home, but I could feel the tears welling up when I was at work, too. I have a lot going well for me, but I'm unable to see it. I just feel very lonely sometimes, probably because my expectations were completely different from what is reality. 

I'm just feeling so numb because I don't know what is right from wrong. The uncertainty of future can be exciting, but I'm freaking out at all the change that's occurring so rapidly. I don't know what to think of my ex and the relationship, I'm trying actively to let go of as much as I can. I don't know where I'm deluded and where I'm seeing the truth.

The first time I played Passage (on exhibit at the MoMA) I was floored. I felt like I'd swallowed my heart with every detail I would discover. I walked away with a jarring clarity and sadness that I've never been presented so poignantly by a work of art before. 

From MoMA's description:
&gt;During the span of a five-minute video game, a player encounters an entire lifetime of obstacles and choices. Jason Rohrer conceived of Passage as a kind of memento mori, with a character that begins as a young adult, ages, and dies, all the while moving across the screen from left to right through different phases into the future. Points are earned from rewards in treasure chests, but many of the chests are empty; Rohrer notes that, as in life, “not every pursuit leads to a reward. . . Over time, though, you can learn which pursuits are likely to be rewarding.” Players may seek points alone or in the company of a life partner. Neither way is more correct than the other: travel and treasure gathering are easier for the agile solo player, but couples can earn more points, although they face more obstacles and one will eventually be slowed by grief when the other dies. When a player dies, the game is over; unlike other video games, there are no multiple lives. “Your score looks pretty meaningless hovering there above your little tombstone,” Rohrer notes. “You die only once, at the very end, and you are powerless to stave off this inevitable loss.”

While on my side, I know I personally have been going through a rough period because I am struggling to find work and am not in school at the moment, but through talks we have had before this one, she helped me understand what simple pleasures I forgot or put away to make room for work work work and since then I thought things were looking up. I think of her as a sister, a soul mate, a friend I want to keep around for the rest of my life, so to hear her say  these things with no pause or hesitation, it is both  shocking and unnerving.

To her, now I lack receptiveness, I lack camaraderie and companionship and we talk about nothing. She claims that when she comes to me about something she is excited about and is not met half way, she looses all steam and does not care anymore. Understandable, yes, but I don't recall ever doing anything like that! I always encourage her and stick behind her whenever she is in a tough situation or is emotionally in need. She always tells me that only I and a few other friends of hers understand her, so right now I am confused, hurt and scared of losing her.  Now she says she feels apathetic to it all and does not want to deal with it, while I am stuck here to pick up the pieces and try to figure out how to repair this now stale friendship.

I'd say that, about a year ago, I enjoyed posting a bit to /r/intj and whatnot, and I found the MBTI to be a really interesting, ah...well, let's face it, I didin't think it was so much a valid tool as a kind of very vague way to describle similar people. It was fun, though!

So, I got curious today and decided to take the online tests again (as part of a healthy and balanced breakfast of procrastination), and I got INFJ.

Here's the interesting part - I know that, since about two or three years, I've become a bit more of a socially, emotionally ""in touch"" person. I'm still not a very outwardly cathartic individual, and as much as I love cute things and sharing emotions online I have a hard time doing that in the real world. Something about not being connected to others enough, feeling like I'm excessively different and not many people seeming to understand. 

Anyhow, the point is that I'm somewhere in the middle of T/F, depending on the situation. I'm naturally very reserved, neutral and thoughtful with regards to many intercations and situations - but I'm a music student, and good stories, entertainment or works of art are things I find excessively cathartic, both to experience and talk about (Yeah, they make me cry often). I guess there's somewhat of a duality concerning my personality in that regard. I find it quite odd, actually. I have many INTJ traits, many INFJ traits as well - and a few from other types here and there. That seems to fit in with my perception that the MBTI isn't something you take very seriously.

1356935895.0,6,self.infj,15poo1,So. I've just been thinking a lot of 'I don't know' and 'what am I doing here' lately.,AndTheHawk,8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/15poo1/so_ive_just_been_thinking_a_lot_of_i_dont_know/,"First off, some background, if you'd like to get a feel for who I am. I am sixteen, female, and did not exactly have the best upbringing. I'm a middle child with moderate middle child syndrome, in my opinion, and OCD (no, I have not seen a professional, but I really don't see what else my compulsions that I've had since childhood could be). My relationship with my parents is strained and interacting with them causes a lot of stress, anger and just all around bad feelings. I hate my younger brother with a passion and have hated him for most of my life. My older brother is okay but I'm not close with him.

So. About my sort-of existential crisis.

I go through periods of happiness and depression, and optimism and pessimism quite often. There are days when I feel like, oh, hey, I can be normal and happy like everyone else, then there are days when I feel like, there must be something wrong with me, what am I even trying to do. The moods can switch from happy/optimistic to depressed/pessimistic in only a couple minutes, though it's harder to do the opposite. Right now I'm feeling a lot of the negative end.

I recently joined a community where I meet up with other high schoolers and a couple adults a few times a week, and I've gotten close with some of them. Well, when I say close, I mean I consider them my friends. I don't dare to try and unload the stuff that fills my head just yet. However, there's a lot of things that happen with these people.

1. There is this one person who is supposed to be my mentor. I've looked up to him and almost idolized him for a while, but this person seems to be the worst person for me. He's very intelligent but also very strict/rough with his words and aggressive. I'm always very sensitive to the undertones of people's words and no matter how many people tell me that he really means well, I can't shake the feeling that what I read into is true and that I'm some sort of disappointment and burden on him. I *know* he means well but I *feel* much more than that and I'm left feeling sick and hopeless and a waste of space when he's trying to tell me something.

2. The people in this community are VERY nice people. Or at least the ones I care about. So I know they won't tell me if I'm being a burden on them. So I worry and I worry and I worry that this whole time they're thinking, I wish AndTheHawk wasn't here. And when anyone so much as hints of that thought, I crumple on the inside and dig a hole for myself until something pulls me up.

3. No one in this community, or no one that I know, actually, is an INFJ. No one can understand me and that frustrates or confuses them sometimes. Or, it just slides off of them and they don't sense it at all and they do something that just hurts me further.

So all of this stuff together just makes me think like I'm kind of not supposed to be here, and I just think, what am I doing here? I don't know what the heck is happening. Maybe things would be better if I just wasn't here.

I don't think about the act of suicide, of shooting myself or such, but I think about the it-would-be-better part quite often.

1348951053.0,8,self.infj,10ojgk,"How seriously do you take typology? How do you use it, view it, and on how deep a level do you identify as your type?",Valkyrian,10,2,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/10ojgk/how_seriously_do_you_take_typology_how_do_you_use/,"This is a rather broad topic for discussion (I may crosspost it to /r/MBTI later). After reflecting on how much I myself have gained interest in typology, I wonder what everyone else's experiences with it are, how you use it, how much credit you give it and how important it is to you. I'll begin with my own story.

When I was younger, the concept of symbolic identity was something I was highly concerned with. I felt like I was different, and I took pride in that. At the same time, I didn't fully understand who I was. It was a time where I was trying to figure myself out, but simultaneously, I had an *ideal* of who I wanted to be, which was really nothing like who I am at all. It's kind of hard to explain, but this ideal was something that I *thought* I was like, but it wasn't actually true. For example, back in middle school and early high school, I liked those silly personality quizzes (""What element are you?"" ""What animal would you be?"" ""What is your superpower?""), and instead of being *honest* while answering them, I'd pick the ones that sounded coolest and got me the type of result I wanted.

Eventually I grew out of that, but identity was still a very important thing to me. I had a better idea of who I was as I aged, but I didn't know how to describe my own personality, and I wanted to. Note, I was not the type of person who hated labels; while I was aware that the human mind is an extremely complex web that goes far beyond ""typology"", I also believed that there had to be certain ways to categorize common thought patterns and mannerisms. I noticed similarities between people as well as differences, and I was interested in these similar tendencies.

A friend of mine had me take the MBTI test; I'd taken it a few times before, but it was for school and I didn't really understand what the results entailed. When I came up with INFJ and googled the results, I was *disturbed* at how well the descriptions fit me. I'd never really been able to put my personality into words before, and all of a sudden, I'm reading articles all about myself - no bullshit, things that *actually* fit. It was an extremely interesting and strange sensation, discovering accurate descriptions of your mind when you've never been able to describe it yourself, and gaining a better comprehension of your thought patterns and how they work.

I like identifying as an INFJ, because I feel that it's so fitting; however, at the same time, I am aware that it isn't *all* of who I am. It describes many things about me accurately, and that's what I find really interesting, but I remind myself that type is not what truly defines a person. Because I'm a person who loves categories, I'm more prone to boxing people in, but I've been trying to not fall into that nowadays. Identity and authenticity are things I will always still value, but I've been trying to keep MBTI at a safe distance of study rather than treating it as the Human Mind Bible.

Nowadays, I see MBTI as a starting guide: A gate of discovery about people, rather than the end-all, be-all of one's being. I think it's a fantastic way to start learning more about yourself and gain a deeper understanding of why your mind might function the way it does. It can offer explanations for why people think in certain ways. There are disagreements I have with some of the deeper aspects of the system and how functions are ""supposed"" to work, and there are many other things I don't quite understand either. It's flawed, no doubt; but it still offers many interesting concepts that I find really fun to speculate about. Am I obsessive? Well, most would probably assume I am from this super long post and the frequency of my activity here. I guess I just like talking about myself, and INFJ characteristics are parts of me that I can more easily discuss with those of a common mindset.",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_10ojgk,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/10ojgk/how_seriously_do_you_take_typology_how_do_you_use/,

Throughout my life I've found that the people I date, or who I close friends with are usually ENTP or ENFP. (I'm borderline between T and F so it depends on how I relate to them). I have almost without fail found that the people who I am most attracted to are ENXPs. I'm aware there is some room for confirmation bias in this, but I usually have very quick chemistry with these people before I get a good grip on their personality. 

Also I found it funny when my parents took the test my dad was INFJ and my mom was ENFP.

I read awhile back an article on a psychology study that demonstrated that the most stable and fulfilling relationships were NOT opposites attract but rather ""likes attract"".

Lets face it. The ENTPs and ENFPs in my past are exes now. So maybe while opposites are more exciting, going for someone more like oneself is better?

Of course thats going to vary on a person to person basis so I don't think we can make sweeping principles on the subject but I'm interested in hear ya'll's experiences.

This story was about a sweet girl who was given to live for thousands of years to save the lives of everyone on her world.  Her friends and family weren't.  They died around her of old age.

I don't know about you but I spend most of my days quietly hiding from inevitability of this kind.  We are in the most interesting century in the most interesting eon that there has ever been.  The Singularity is breathing down our necks.  Total social collapse could happen at any moment.  Financial ruin is coming this year. 
Transcension theory says that within what could be our extremely long lives we might develop technologically and intellectually to the point we're no longer bound by space and time.  

We might exist in almost endless security living in inner-space.  We could become product of our own will rather than the whim of physics.  This nebulae wherein we have been birthed from star-stuff might be womb and cradle for a new collective of entities breathing neutrons and dancing with quarks. 

I find this at odds with so much of conventional wisdom.  Death is inevitable.  Change is always for the worse.  Pain is part of living.  

Why?  We have but one life and therein we're told these things are permanent and unchangeable yet the car has existed less than a hundred and fifty years.  The cell phone, a magical device which allows god-like communication between two sides of the world, is barely twenty years old.  The internet in it's current form is less than a decade.

Why should I have been told so much to fear impermanence?  Why this insistence on accepting death or escaping it through 'divine favor'.  Pray and God will make sure there's a happy ending.  

Fuck God.  

Why can we not make this ending ourselves?  We may live to transcend.  You and I, sitting at our desks behind our computers today with all of our worries may exist in that moment when thought shrinks to a point too small for the universe to contain and too diverse for it to control with it's petty amalgam of physical laws.

What will it feel like?  What sensation will there be?  

Will we fear?

Will that be the end?

A lot of the time we would have deep philosophical conversations that you just rarely get to have in real life.

What started online transitioned to real life, it became clear that I was the type of person you could talk to about pretty much anything and as time went on people just sort of naturally picked up on this and would seek me out for this purpose.

NT's are known for their ability to navigate the world in a detached way. Whereas NFs are known for their emotional reactions. This of course is a simplistic view that when examined in more detail, yields different conclusions. INFJs, as reported by many, can easily detach from their emotions. How do we do this? Fe-Ti seem to work in conjunction with this detached state. Ni is a perceiving function that takes in sense information that gets synthesized into a big picture/vision/vibe etc...There is no judgement just an openness to what IS. I may have an emotional reaction to what my Ni perceives and this is Fe. However Fe is also putting myself in their place and as I use Ti to further analyze, I find myself detached from my emotion. So Fe (putting yourself in another's position) and Ti, (a subjective speculation of another's reality), I believe to be the functions most responsible for this detached state. 

Fe/Ti for the intuitives are used by NFs (INFJ, ENFJ) and NT's (INTP, ENTP) alike. What might be the difference between our detachment and the NT detachment?",,False,,t5_2r39a,False,,,True,t3_1jmxhq,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1jmxhq/nf_detachment_vs_nt_detachment/,

My father pays my child support to me (19F) rather than to my mother. This hasn't been an issue until about four months ago. He sent a check a week late once. Not a huge deal, but I sent him a text message about it. I like consistency and I'm a college student. I depend on that check.

He berates me over text message, pointing out my personal flaws and being overall really immature. However, he begins sending the checks on time. The last contact I received from him was a text message that said ""It was your choice not to send it to me in jan  I ask 5 + time sorry""

I haven't heard anything since. I call him once a week. I don't know if he'll ever answer. I love him, but I hate how he treats me.


Bonus Poem! This was written as a song, so the rhyme scheme is way too perfect: 

You’re 49 today
It’s cold and raining and you’re a thousand miles away
But it’s still your birthday

And I’m out of town with friends
They’re joking and laughing and thank God I can pretend
Because this is harder than expected

You still won’t answer my calls
I’m not naïve and I don’t want to be a know-it-all
I just wanna know what I did wrong

I have tried to be smart
But in this case I don’t even know where to start
You’re breaking my heart

Daddy please call me
I’d forgive you, I promise I am not angry
I just want to be family

Most days I act like I’m fine
I grin and laugh and I live a life that is truly mine
But I’m just buying time

March 26th
That’s that last time you spoke to me or contacted
Do you care that I exist?

I’m your only child
I’ve tried to be good and never considered going wild
I’ve tried to make you smile

But now I’m out of plans
I have loved you, and I have done all that I can
I can’t make you into a new man

So this is goodbye for now
If you decide I’m worth my salt I’ll be around
But I can’t let you hold me down

Happy birthday
You don’t miss me, even all those miles away
And that’s gonna have to be okay.

I’ll be okay
It’ll be okay, it’ll be okay
At least that’s what I’ll say.

So I'm hoping that someone out there can tell me if they've ever experienced anything like this: 

This part is background: About a year ago, I graduated from college with no definite plans for the year, started studying for the LSAT and was seeing a boy who was also taking a year off of school with no plans for the year.  We were both pretty emo and worried, but his company and attention made me happy and I think talking to me was a relief for him (he got to be pretty needy and I kind of thrived on his dependence).  About a month before the LSAT, he asks for space (he's an INTJ), and the relationship and friendship ends just like that.  He eventually comes back and rejoins my group of friends, but still ignores me and somehow my life fell into ruins.  I had to move in with my parents for the year (and had zero structure in my days, which was extremely stressful for me-i took up yoga and went to the gym daily), he got to stay on campus close to our friends who were still living there, so they are all really close and I was on the outside although I would go visit them pretty frequently.  I have had contact with him on several occasions, some times we can be friendly towards each other and at other times I can tell that he wants me to not be there. I have also seen him get a lot closer with one of the other women in the group.

This is the issue at hand: I became really needy with my friends, especially in the month leading up to the LSAT and I'm usually not a needy person, I like to think through my problems alone, but this one I didn't know how to handle and I broke down. 

I feel like I lost my sense of self in the process and have spent the year alternating between being overly emotional and insensitive and feeling like the friends I turned to for support hate me.  My friends can't handle how emotional I am, but also point out how insensitive I am.  I feel like they see me as a selfish bitch and that I am losing them (this group of college friends was the first time I had a niche, as an introvert, this is indispensable to me).  I feel like I've lost my INFJ-ness. How do I become the person they (and I) used to like again?

If you've seen any of my posts around on here, they're about my recent break up. As INFJs, I'm sure you've all noticed how deep we love. I have a question about when that love ends. 

Some days, I fear that I will never be able to love another, or will be turned off to the idea of ever wanting to feel so vulnerable again, since that's when I was hurt the most this time. My relationship was only eight months, but I can't even fathom how people aren't crushed for life after an eight year relationship's end. 

It's been about two months since the break up, she initiated. I've actually been doing really well. I've taken up lots of new hobbies, surrounded myself with people I love, and just been busy and proactive. 

So how do I move on from feeling like I won't want to love another, not because I'm in love with my SO (in fact, I deleted her photos and removed her from facebook without much regret), but because I fear being this hurt again, or possibly much more hurt? 

Maybe today's just been a very rough day, but I guess I need some convincing that I'll find someone who loves me just as truly and deeply.

I am an INFJ who has no problem putting on an extroverted shell, being outgoing, and meeting people.


However, while I have friends - some for nearly 20 years that I still keep up with - I am not very good about actually hanging with people.


This is both by myself and ""couples"" friends with my wife. It would probably be good for me to do so more often, but I am not very motivated to. Issues:


-Not a lot of people appeal to me. I like a lot of people... but not everyone is worth spending precious time with. 


-I honestly do not even think about it, and then I realize it has been a while since hanging with anyone. 


Spending quality time with other people is something I find valuable, but I am not necessarily excited about it. It is worse now that I am married and hanging with my best friend every night, but she thinks it would be good for me too.

I do of course understand some of the good qualities to come out of my INFJ personality (very compassionate and understanding, patient), but my brain views my good traits with less weight then it views what I hate about myself.

I hate that my brain wants to desperately fit in and be friends with people but sucks so bad at doing it. Id honestly feel like I would be ok if I didn't want to engage in social interaction but my brain unfortunately does. It's like knowing you are allergic to peanuts but compulsively trying to stuff your face with them whenever you get around them because you find them irresistible. 

I feel like I have to continuously talk in a conversation in order to not feel awkward or out of place in the discussion circle. If I try to be silent I come off as rigid and appear strange to others. This is probably because my brain actively thinks about me being silent and almost ""counts"" how long I have been silent. It's torture.

For what it helps, I know he is an INTP, and we both do share a little bit of a similar family background, in that he and I both never had dads, and both of us had pretty emotionally unstable moms. 
So...I can say that he understands emotions and tough times, but...how am I to interpret this confidence he has??

Another thing we do have in common is an early disdain for authority and useless rules and a real sense of not fitting in. Except for, in his case, as is pretty typical for INTPs I understand, he realized pretty early on he was smarter than a lot of adults, disliked school because it didn't get him, and developed a real love for rebellion, but also an independent learning habit and spent a lot of time reading lots of books.

 I, on the other hand, learned early on that I was ""weird"", never wanted, and really couldn't, adapt myself to fitting in, and being more extra super sensitive than anybody else I knew, instead developed a real love of reading and learning, and looked for teachers to idolize and saw books and learning as a way to access better and more interesting and more beautiful worlds...

So you can see that we have some of these critical experiences in common, I consider natural curiosity to be one of the most desirable traits in a partner,  and yet....some part of me is afraid, like I don't know if I can *depend* on a person who doesn't, or says he doesn't, struggle with self-esteem...

My therapists and psychiatrist believe that I have amnesia of roughly 10 years of my life due to constant trauma caused by my anxiety.  Nobody really noticed my anxiety because, as you all know, we like to put on a good show for people, and who was I to be putting my troubles on others and giving them a bad day?

This all culminated several years back after I attempted to hang myself and my boyfriend had to cut the rope after I jumped and drag me to the bank of the stream.  Eventually, after experimenting with antidepressants, my therapists and psychiatrists discovered that my apathy for life and general depression was caused by my anxiety over every little detail that I took in about people (the thing that makes us so intuitive).

During the experimenting with antidepressants, there were a number of other things discovered.  I had been having roughly 300 petit-mal seizures per day since I was born, and I did have a little bit of depression and ADHD (though they give those meds out like candy, so I'm not convinced).  Life had become livable, but after several years, the realization of the severity of my anxiety came to light.

I was prescribed a rather high dosage of an anti-anxiety medicine, and I've been on it for probably about a year now, my sense of time isn't great.  But since I started taking it, I'm not sure that I'm as intuitive about people as I used to be, and I'm worried that my morals are slipping.  Sometimes I'll have a bad day and I'll actually show it a little bit without meaning to because my anxiety about causing someone any inkling of discomfort doesn't always stop me anymore.

I worry that this may be a slippery slope, as my feeling of connection with nature and the world has also waned.  I don't want to become just another face in the crowd of people who go about their day and cause pain left and right, but I don't want to talk to my psychiatrist about lowering my anti-anxiety meds either, because they make life so much easier, and guilt no longer defines my every action.

Basically if I think my personality is drifting, so I can access if I like the change, or if I want to proactively and conciously counter it.


I had been spending much time trying to understand people's motivations, and emotional reactions.  One thing you may or may not know about intjs is we have pretty strong emotional reactions, but we don't actually understand our own, or other people's emotions well.  So we tend to learn at an early age to act with very subdued emotions and we have to ""think"" to understand how other people are feeling, why what we say might be considered rude or something.


Anywho, I got sick and tired of not understanding, and so spent years thinking, watching, reading etc just to get it.  I think in all of that I learnt to express my F more than my T.  I don't mind, it does seem to be simplier to interact with people now so there's that.  I'm not as supprised when someone says they'll do X by such and such a date, and yet they don't.  I no longer think they are evil, it's just that most people don't keep their word, and/or they say what they think you want to hear pretty much just to shut you up.  It seems that that's the way most people interact.

I hope to be a writer. I had an assignment for one of my classes that allowed me to complete any project I wanted. So, I outlined a book series I plan on writing... along with the rationalization behind it, largely founded in psychology and an analysis of science-fiction/fantasy/myth. That is the genre :P

When finished, it will be about 10 pages, but in a light, conversational easy-reading style.

Basically, this is my life's work thus far. I'm young and still learning, so I can deal with hearing if its bad. Mostly, I'd like to know if I'm barking up the wrong tree so that I can save myself time and effort. Or, if someone else has put the same amount of time and thought into similar things, and come to different or better conclusions-- that helps too.

Why am I asking INFJs? I think you'll follow my thoughts more easily. I tackle very big ideas, very casually, in a few paragraphs, leaving a lot of details unsaid. I think other INFJs might be able to picture the world I hope to build in their heads with the minimal detail I've provided thus far.

I'd only really like to send it to a few people, and receive back any thoughts, criticisms, or suggestions that they feel.

I normally wouldn't think that much of it, but the same thing happened to the intj as well.  

 All would be well and good had it ended there, but the infj (18) is now enamored with this guy (25).  Inviting him to other events and trying to include him as much as possible (apparently she has had older boyfriends in the past).  The infj seems pretty blind to the whole situation and is acting like nothing is amiss.

The man with the subtle smile:

There once was a man with a subtle smile and kind features

His only priority was the help and aid of all of god's creatures

He would bend over backwards and deliver his best

And many a time would hinder himself for the good of the rest

He never lacked for company or hoards of good friends

He enjoyed drinking and merriment and a good roast now and then

He made sure everyone possible would be having a good time

He heckled and chortled and knew perfectly all of his lines

He was sweet and emotional and was coined a ""nice guy""

He pretended to be tough, but you knew he enjoyed a good cry

He was loyal and honest and would do anything for those close

Friends and his family loved him, and he was more apt than most

But underneath it all brewed a stormy interior

Far away from the laughs, the smiles and fake exterior

He longed for passion, the intimacy of one

But alas everywhere he looked he was met with none

His face would never say it, but he was screaming with pain and 
misery

His soul cried out for someone to help and relieve him from this tyranny

But his outer shell was as masterful and thick as could be

It was impenetrable, a fortress of facades, as grand as a tree

He contemplated death often, but hated the consequences

So many people would be confused and angry with this unforeseen happening

So he continued to live, mentally exhausted and imagining

A world, perfect and wrought with no borders, hatred or fences

He lived each day like the last, helping all those he could

He wished more than anything for death, because he understood

More often than not he sat by himself in the bleachers

I'm a 26 year-old INTP male. I've recently started seeing a 19 year-old INFJ female whom I've really started to care about. 

There are differences between us obviously with the greatest difference being our experiences leading up to where we are now as well as my continual introspection as well as mind-set changes since the age of around 20. 

I feel at times there are so many things I should be telling her, or teaching her but have times expressing myself fully. I feel I can also come across as patronising or condescending when I do start trying to explain a concept of growth or perhaps a slightly different way of thinking and approaching a problem. 

What would the best approach to this be? How does your personality type adjust to new information? Critical thinking? Paradigm shifts? Devils advocate arguments? I'm just not sure of the best way to present new information or if I should be mentioning it instead of possibly letting her come to her own conclusions. 

Further, I'd like to get her to read a little bit more. She mentioned she loved to read when she was younger but felt that the form of escapism it provided may have been destructive to her eventual personality growth (paraphrasing here). Could someone explain this to me if you have an inkling of what she could mean in terms of whether she would read again? Should I be encouraging her to read or should I rather take that as a request to not bring up reading(My choice of literary poison: fantasy, sci-fi, philosophy, astronomy, auto-biography, personality typing, psychology and business). 

I know that not all INFJs are the same and that I may be in the wrong subreddit for this, but I'm pretty curious about your personality type in terms of your willingness to learn/be taught/deal with ideas.

hi /r/INFJ, my ""shadow"" function, Ni, has been exploding/imploding for hours. though its usually standard for INTPs to suppress this type of intangible perception, the overwhelming response is not something i can ignore. i'm not really sure why I'm even posting here, but this isn't something i can share on /r/INTP with much credibility. 

to begin, there has been a persistent sense of dread that has waxed and waned throughout the day. i keep searching for causes of this anxiety but there's nothing tangible i can find. the closest is the internet black-out news of Syria. however, i didn't hear that story before this sensation started and such news isn't enough to prompt this response anyway. i regularly read both positive and negative world news and much more serious events have not prompted this feeling. its the kind of emotion i feel while expecting a horrifying event in a movie/video game due to the musical score. the issue is i haven't been listening to anything unusual— just the same old electronica and classical stations i've had on my pandora for years.

one thing that should be noted: my mental state has always been rather robust. aside from a period of depression during my teenage years, there have never been mental disorders that afflicted me. bipolar disorder, asperger's, ADHD, and other common complaints from INTPs are illnesses i have researched in detail. i do not suffer from the symptoms outlined in these and other disorders. as evidence here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGsFCvq0cMg) of me from march where i talk about being an INTP. 

___

anyway, there isn't really a response i'm searching for. all i know— this is definitely Ni. there is something seriously wrong going on right now. [*aside from the standard death and agony going on throughout the world*]. i don't know where it's happening, i don't even know what it is, **but i know there is tremendous suffering**. the worst part about this knowledge is knowing there isn't anything i can do about it right now. sigh.

We met in college a few years back, I think I initiated, don't remember anymore. She was dating someone at the time (I've hung out with the two of them when they were together) and they had been together for I'm guessing 5 or so years. It was whatever, but as we spent more time together in classes and outside of class, I started developing feelings for her. She broke up with her boyfriend, and 2 months after, I decided to tell her (stupid decision on my part), but anyway she rejected me nicely and we're still really good friends. I moved on.

We have ZERO mutual friends, so everytime we hang out it's just the two of us. She's invited me a few times to meet her friends but I've always declined (don't like drinking, and don't like bars). Mostly at around 1 in the morning when she's already kind of tipsy but I don't go, so it's become this thing where we see each other 2-3 times a month and it's almost always scheduled in advance.

We don't talk daily (I like it like this), but sometimess she'll leave me a message on facebook with something to read or listen to, and sometimes I reply back, sometimes I don't. The times I do reply, the conversation lasts for HOURS. Don't get me wrong, I love our conversations but sometimes I need to sleep to wake up for work. We've talked about anything and everything. Animals, space exploration, philosophies, religion, politics, future goals, etc. We agree on alot of things. I do much better online and I'm sure she sees it too, I'm way more talkative. When we're together I'm kind of awkward but that's whatever. We've gone out for dinner and trips to the museum among other things, but majority of it is spent in her apartment drinking beer, watching movies, and other low key stuff.

It's a cycle with her. We don't talk for a long time, and then we talk, click again, and talk for consecutive days sending stupid stuff to each other, and then we'll go cold again with no conversation, and repeat.

She kept busy with herself, and we just shook hands when she left the party.

Anyways, I found out about her through her Facebook page, and want to ask her out (send her a private message). But I know as an INFJ myself I would find it somewhat personally intrusive if someone I don't know about came to me and asked me out.

I don't know if I can meet her again. But I really want to know her and see if she's someone I would enjoy being with. What should I do here?

Felt awful and I wanted to share here because I think you guys would understand,twlife10,6,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/infj/comments/1csjp1/completely_withdrew_at_a_social_gathering_today/,"Today I spent the day with my SO. Spending time with him is always great, and I've hung out with his friends many times before. I even did a camping trip with him and his friends which turned out great.

Today was weird though. It was 4/20 so we were having a bbq thing at the park. I smoked a lot and I think that was part of the issue. I started to get really quiet and started to feel really weird and alone. Everyone there was really nice but I didn't know anyone except my boyfriend...I can't really use that as an excuse because I've been in social situations like that where I was totally fine and even made some friends. But this time was bad. I started to feel really withdrawn, kept going to the bathroom to be alone. It got so bad that I felt like I was having a panic attack on the way to the bathroom--I started breathing rapidly and couldn't stop. 

It reminded me of high school, which also triggered some bad emotions. It reminded me of it in that I would get way too stoned and get really quiet and start to feel totally alone in a room filled with people. That's gotta be one of the worst feelings I've ever felt.

I'm still trying to make sense of it, but I think smoking a lot had something to do with it. I don't think I should be smoking that much around large groups anymore. What do you guys think? Ever had really bad social anxiety out of nowhere? How did/do you deal with it without getting too into your own head and too emotional?

Luckily my SO is awesome and knows me really well--he knew something was off immediately and we went and got some awesome mexican food and hung out at his place after because he knew how hard that was for me. He's had his fair share of social anxiety so he gets it.

So we've all dealt with this at some point in all of our lives. We first meet someone, and from their first impression of us all they can say is that we are ""quiet"".  
  
I don't need to hold a poll to know how frustrated that makes everyone in this subreddit.  
  
The problem is that I'm trying to move to a different department in my company, and I was told that I have the problem of being too ""quiet"". There will still be a second round of interviews, so I do have some time to work on changing my presentation. 
  
First of all, I've heard this phrase my whole life, and have yet to figure out what people actually ***mean*** by it. This is not a helpful interview tip at all, since all it does is confirm the same thing I've been told my whole life: *something* (god only knows what) is wrong with me. 
   
Does anyone have any advice to impart about how to present yourself in an interview? Has any INFJ had a similar thing happen, and did you get the job?  
  
There are tons of expletives I could be using here, but I think everyone here shares my frustration to the point where using them is almost pointless.

Until I found that some of my insanity was just me thinking differently (I owned an Apple computer in high school).
 
So I was reading posts on this forum like it was a support group. I loved it. I felt like I belonged, albeit with a group of people who feel they don't belong. 

However, I continuously read about how many people are mistyped. So  I took many more tests and consistently tested INFJ. Is there any way to be certain? I want to know if I am INFJ, or if I just wish I were.

I would hazard to guess, at least in my case, that it has to do with a combination of things.  For one, I automatically empathize with individuals and morph my central traits into behaviors which allow for more fluid and specialized interaction with different individuals, based upon their needs and thinking patterns.  There are more reasons I feel complex, reasons I have identified intuitively, but I have not spent the time to suss them out enough to write about them coherently.

It's been suggested numerous times to me to start hobbies/clubs etc. to meet new people try and gain new friends, but here's the point: I don't want to meet new people. I don't want to go through the beginning ness of meeting new people, having to deal with them, know that they've prejudged me - more often than not, negatively. And hen having to break through that.

The energy and emotional toll it takes, I feel is just not worth it. I've done in over and over and over again through my life due to moving countries and changing schools and moving across the country and things, and I've only found one person who has stuck with me. 

Now I'm not trying to invalidate that one person. Due to each others personal lives and geographical locations we don't see wah other nearly as reguarly as we want to/need to. 

I've no idea if any will get this, or if I'm just being a whingey bitch or whatever. But just thought I'd put it out there.

We met at a mutual friend's party this year and I've forced myself to initiate contact both in-person and over FB, text, etc. because I find her attractive and mysterious. We've been out for coffee twice (I asked her to go to dinner after the first coffee date but she said her nights were all booked up) and we have a few classes together at school but I'm having trouble gauging how fast to move forward with things... She makes a ton of eye contact, asks future-oriented questions, remembers lots of tiny details about previous interactions and brings them up when relevant, and carries conversation during lulls (thank god). We also have very similar moral and value systems which is excellent. However, I feel like I'm not getting much deeper with her conversation wise and I don't know how to gauge progress. We've started to talk about career focuses and five-year-plan sort of stuff as well as surface religious topics but I feel like I would be so much farther along with most other girls in talking about deeper subjects by now. I don't know if we she keep doing coffee dates or if I should press for something bigger. Initiating is so challenging for me :(


Three Questions for you lovely INFJs: 

**Would an INFJ bother getting this far with someone not connected to their close friends at all without the possibility of dating? (I wouldn't as an INTJ)**

**Is it possible she's avoiding confrontation by always agreeing to go out together?**

**How do I foster deeper conversations with an INFJ?**
