The shitposting, price commentating, 12-hour rule-breaking, and smurfing stops here. We've been far too lenient.

Read the [rules and guidelines] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/). 

- If you shitpost or offer unsolicited price commentary, you'll receive a week's ban. This is almost unconditional, and I'm not defining the conditions now. You will receive a week's ban, as defined in the rules.
- If you hijack somebody's trade, you will be banned for a week.
- If you break the 12-hour rule, I'm no longer warning you. First ban is 48 hours. Second offense is a week. There's some bit of leniency (for instance, submitting a thread 11 hours after your last thread) but that's about it.
- If you use a smurf to circumvent the 12-hour rule, shitpost, hijack trades, or blatantly (and stupidly) attempt to manipulate prices, I'm banning the smurf. And when I find your main account, I'm banning that as well.

From my end, a ban first, ask questions later approach will be employed. If you want to appeal a ban, message the moderators--link is on the right hand side, near the ""moderators"" box.

I don't care what you think the price of a Golden Greevil should be. I don't care if you think somebody is asking for too much (unless it's absolutely ludicrous, such as ""[H] GG [W] Hook"" or too little--""[H] common [W] GG""). Be polite and civil. Instead of flaming or ***offering price commentary***, just report instead.

Quit with the ""upvoted for fair price"" (unless it genuinely is) and ""LOL GOOD LUCK"" shenanigans as well. If I see those posts, I'm just going to remove them.

Again, [read the rules and guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/).

Blah blah upvote this for visibility and whatnot.

Last week they said Crystal Rift frog was 15-17 keys when no one in all of the trading sites would pay more than 6 keys for it.

I just met this Mr.Ham guy earlier, I pointed out how wrong the price on the Sunfire Wardog was and linked him to 5 threads in playdota.com showing people's c/o's for it and how wrong other prices also were. He said he couldn't take those trades seriously because they were 4 days old and they weren't straight b/o's, he then accused me of trolling and ignored me. More people in the dota2traders.com chat also pointed such things out and he called us trolls and left.

These guys have over 1000 keys in their hidden inventories. For a proof of this, just add Mr.Frenky (you can find his profile through D2P) and tell him you're interested in buying keys. They'll show up.

They try to sell bad low tier items for high prices, and buy real high price ones for low, quoting that horrible list. 

There was this guy who was BEGGING to sell his Sunfire Wardog in tf2outpost.com for 18 keys because he thought it was its price, a dota2prices.com follower.

Every single time I see someone quote dota2prices.com in my trades, it's a shark who knows what he is doing. Last week I was selling my BA red demon and I got 30 people offering me their Crystal frogs quoting its 15-17k prices in dota2prices.com. Now that all the sharks got rid of their CR couriers, price plummeted in the list?

I'm not posting this to troll anyone, just trying to prevent naive traders who follow that site when they try to sell their items, like that guy who sold his Sunfire dog for 18 keys, or all of those people who bought CR frogs for 15 keys. Don't fall for it, people. If you see anyone quoting that site it's a shark for sure, and do your own research before you sell any of your items, you might be getting scammed for your valuable items.

The only reason he doesn't just trade you and wants it by e-mail, is that he will try to login with your gmail / whatever account, just after you send him the invite, since he now knows what your e-mail adress is.

I have also seen people trying to do this in lounge. They look for expensive items (TI2 couriers etc) and make a post like : ""this is my email XX, let's talk there, mail me""

Many people have passwords like 1234abcd... and many people use the same password for email account and steam account. If someone logins with your email account, your account won't be protected by steamguard anymore.

So :

1. Never send anyone an email from the account connected to your steam account

2. If you have a weak email password, you better change it.

3. In gmail (not sure about other providers) you can connect your email account with your mobile phone. Everytime someone tries to login from an unknown computer, a message is sent to your phone with a code. Without that code, noone can login. Activate this service..


I got 2 adds today from people trying to do that, so I thought I should warn you, if anyone is not aware of this.

* harass other users? If so, **have some manners!**

* manipulate market forces? If so, **stop right now.** Most people see right through it, and you create a lot of work for the moderators.

* post speculation as fact? If so, **cite your sources.**

* hold grudges? If so, **get over it.**

* generalize and point fingers at entire nationalities? **If so, that's called xenophobia, and it is STUPID.**

* fight regularly with other users? If so, **it makes you look petty and reflects badly on you as a trader. Stop it.**

In game chat channels became overrun with bots and highballers, and this was a refuge for fair, accurate prices, and friendly people who enjoyed the in game economy.

As of late it's been people ready to fight to death over their investments, and there's been a lot of hard feelings that are ruining the atmosphere of our sub community.  Speculation is one of the fun parts about trading, but I prefer to do it by myself because that never turns into a ""HAHA suck it you early adopters, you lost some profit!""

Why do we feel the need to attack others because of shifts in pricing of volatile items?  This is NOTHING new to the community.  

I remember last year during TI2, all I wanted was a Smeevil.  I unboxed probably 100 Champ/Challenger crates, and didn't get one.  Before that I had unboxed a ton of Sithil's chests trying to get a Sunfire, and I ended up with a bunch of Tb's and Hooks.  Back then hooks were mythical and went for about 3-4 keys, Tbs were uncommons and they weren't worth shit because they were ugly before they got updated and became the first Immortal.  I had Greedy Greevils when they were worth 40 keys, and I had Kantusas when they were worth 50. I didn't always come out ahead as things appreciate and depreciate and yes, I occasionally made some bad trades. 

TLDR; My point is, I've lost a lot, and I've gained a lot through trading.  But never before did I feel the need to shove it in the face of other people.  This sub is supposed to be one of the best places you can go to trade with likeminded people, instead everyone is behaving like children as of late.  I'd really like to revisit the feeling of community and brotherhood that we used to have here, but everyone's being a Greedy Greevil.

I proposed on /r/dota2 that Valve makes available any TI3 merchandise online.  We all know that Valve watches these sub-reddits, and does make changes based on community feedback.  (Just take a look at the Cauldron and Mace)  

Please go support this post (http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1jf4bw/q_should_valve_have_an_online_sale_for_all_of_the/)  

Let's see if we can get Valve to listen to the community once again.  

(To the mods, I'm sorry if this does not follow the proper usage of this subforum, but I know a lot of people on here who would like to see this happen based on recent posts here.  Please allow this post to stay up as it only benefits the community, thanks!)

### •°º0(Helpdesk)0º°•

Description: Often I am asked ~~what does a hero truly need~~ questions about trading, determining an item's value and other few things. A few common details about trading that I follow are as follows. Also a FAQ.

***

## Quick Guide on Trading (for Beginners)

__» Determine an item's value by asking yourself the following questions__

+ _Does the item look good in game?_
+ _For a hero equipment item, how popular is the hero?_
+ _How much value does it hold in [the Official Dota2 Store](http://www.dota2.com/store/?appid=570) or [Steam Market](http://steamcommunity.com/market)?_
+ _Can the item be obtained by a drop?_
+ _How rare is the item?_

__» More tips on Determining an item's value__

+ _For items that drops in game, the new items are more rare than the older items._
+ _Buyers usually prefer to purchase complete sets or the items that will help them complete their set._
+ _A Tournament Item's value is immensely affected by the Item's description._
+ _Items that are classified as Immortal can no longer be obtained by purchase or drop. Therefore the total quantity of a immortal item will never increase._

__» Trade Currency__

+ _As with any other trade market, there is a common currency here that is accepted by all traders: [Treasure Keys](http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/57939770)._
+ _[Treasure Keys](http://www.dota2.com/store/itemdetails/57939770) do not drop in game. They can be purchased from store or traders. If you are looking forward to liquidate your items (ie, convert your items into hard cash or something reliable that will allow you to purchase items by trade) you should try to get keys by trades._

__» Safety Issues__

+ ___Steam Trades:___ _It is always safe to trade items using Steam's trade option. Any item addition (or removal) to (or from) the trade table will be displayed on the chat log. Hover your mouse over the items to check item details (this is very important when trading special items). ""All trades are final"" according to Steam, it means Steam Authority will not return you your items if you are scammed. Please read [Steam Trading Policy](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9958-MJDG-3003) for more details._
+ ___Steam Guard:___ _Steam Guard must be in Enabled state for 14 days prior to trading._
+ ___PayPal Trades:___ _It can be made safe by trading with trusted traders. Also, a trusted middleman can ensure that you receive your item after paying the money. However, the possibility of a chrageback can not be prevented._
+ ___Scammer Database:___ _[Steamrep](http://steamrep.com/) website holds the database of known scammers. It is like the bible for steam traders. I would urge you to report any scam you encounter on Steamrep website._
+ ___Finally:___ _Always take your time to assess a trade. If you're in doubt, do not trade._

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

__Q)__ I have `this`, `this` and `this`. What can I get?  
__A:__ _I will estimate your items value (credit) and tell you. You can pick up any offered games/items that matches your items value (credit)._

__Q)__ I want to get `Keys` for my items. Can you do that?  
__A:__ _I generally do not offer `Keys` for your items. However, if you need `Keys` for a urgent matter, let me know and we will work something out!_

__Q)__ I have noticed a `change in prices` of some items, why has it changed?  
__A:__ _I usually decide the price of an item based on its demand and supply while keeping a reference to its price on [The Dota2 Store](http://www.dota2.com/store/?appid=570). If I have adequate supply of an item, then it is likely that the price will drop. Alternatively, The price may rise if there is a sudden demand of an item that has a limited supply._

1354656595.0,90,self.Dota2Trade,14a6wp,[PSA] How to safely trade Dota 2/Steam-tradable items for currency over Paypal or Moneypak!,musical_hog,98,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14a6wp/psa_how_to_safely_trade_dota_2steamtradable_items/,"In this guide, we will discuss the safe methods by which to convert your Dota 2 (or any Steam-tradable) items for cash over Paypal or Moneypak.

I will assume you know how to find a buyer/seller and list your items. That information should be obvious, if you're using this community. I will also assume you have set up a Paypal account. Verify it!

Full disclosure: **selling items for cash over Paypal is never 100% safe. Chargebacks can and do happen, even with users who have a lot of rep. The best you can do is minimize your risk by following these steps OR using Moneypak (USA residents only, but read on).**

*****

***Step One: Rep rep rep!***

When selling or buying an item over Paypal, the #1 most important thing is reputation. Without it, you will have a hard time buying items of significant value because it's unclear whether you can be trusted not to incur a chargeback. It's also important as a seller because you will attract more business if you have a lot of +rep.

*Update: It is highly encouraged to check if your buyer's Paypal account is verified. [Follow these steps!](http://redd.it/19youv)*


**[SteamRep](http://steamrep.com)** is your *best friend* when determining whether someone is reputable or not. SteamRep is a scam report database, wherein users submit proof that another user is a scammer. Under no circumstances should you trade with a scammer because you are putting yourself at significant risk to get the scammer tag passed on to you.

* [Here is what a community admin's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197975564454)

* [Here is what a scammer's profile will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198039183046)

* [Here is what a person with no special tag will look like.](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197964482358)

*Special note:* You should Google the other trader's SteamID64, which is their **permanent profile link**. As /u/varrogath points out, there could be a scam report filed against them that has not yet resulted in the scammer being marked. This is a great suggestion!


**Reputation threads** are used to keep track of purchases/sales made over Paypal/Moneypak, and it's highly encouraged to set one up. There are only two websites that house rep threads that I recognize as legitimate (though more may exist):

* [SourceOP.com](http://forums.sourceop.com/forum/) is the birthplace of modern Steam trading. For reasons unknown to me, people came here originally to sell TF2 items, and it quickly gained fame as the most heavily trafficked trade site. Many thousands of rep threads are hosted there, [such as mine!](http://sourceop.com/modules.php?name=Forums&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=76672&amp;highlight=)

* [Dota2Traders.com](http://dota2traders.com) is a site created by some users of this community and others who wanted to set up a home base of their own. It is now officially affiliated with SteamRep, so you can host your rep thread there and even file a scam report with them. They even have middlemen.

When examining someone's rep thread, you need to take into account the following things:

1. How old is the thread? If it's brand new, that may be a warning sign. If it's months or years old, that's probably a good sign.

2. How many +reps does this person have? If only just a few, I would avoid doing a large transaction with them. If there is any -rep, read it carefully and determine if it's worth the risk!

3. Is the person you're talking to *really* the person in the rep thread? Double check by asking them to PM you from that forum account with a secret phrase! I've been impersonated about a dozen times by people who link to my rep thread with a spoof account on Steam. Be careful!

If the person's rep checks out with you, move forward. If not, walk away! You have no reason to feel guilty about saying no.

**In the event someone doesn't have a rep thread, but you want to work with them anyway,** look at their Steam profile. Consider the following things:

* Profile rep means nothing. It can be deleted by the owner of the Steam profile, so you won't see any -rep if the owner doesn't want you to.

* If the profile is extremely new with *few* games and/or friends, you should probably walk away.

* If the account is old (think *at least* one year old) and the owner has many hours (think hundreds or thousands of hours) of game play, then they are more trustworthy than Joe Random, who has a sketchy profile. Still, a rep thread is best!

*****

***Step Two: Finding a middleman***

The use of a middleman when dealing with Paypal/Moneypak transactions is *imperative*. It significantly reduces the risk for both parties, since neither will have to ""go first"" when trading. There are many great and trustworthy individuals who offer their services for free, but some may charge a small fee. Tipping is entirely optional, but it is considered polite to tip the middleman if it's a large or time-consuming transaction.

* /r/dota2trade moderators can and do middleman on a regular basis. [Message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if you need someone! I have middlemanned for well over $10000 in goods over two years.

* [SteamRep middlemen](http://steamrep.com/list/M) are community admins who volunteer their time, and can be trusted 100%.

* [Dota2Traders](http://dota2traders.com/pages/middleman/) has a list of middlemen. I recommend Leon!

If you can't find one, wait until you can! Do not rush a deal, or you might end up getting scammed, and there's nothing anyone can do about it at that point.

*****

***Step Three: Completing the transaction!***

Once you have found a middleman and all parties are online, the transaction should go as follows:

1. Group chat is opened with all parties involved.

2. Check everyone's profiles to make sure that there are no impersonators or fake middlemen.

3. Seller then sends the items to the middleman. [Beware the middleman injection scam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/13072o/psa_trading_reminders_be_careful/) Check the person you're trading with before accepting.

4. Buyer then sends a gift payment over Paypal to the seller. Gifts aren't protection against a chargeback, but at least make it more of a pain to accomplish. Some people also request that the buyer includes a link to the buyer's Steam profile in the notes section and a bit claiming that they won't chargeback. Again, this won't save you from a chargeback, but it's good form to complete anyway.

5. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected. If there is a dispute about the amount, fees, or whether the payment has arrived, the middleman holds the items until a resolution has been reached.

6. Middleman then sends the items to the buyer.

7. Exchange +rep on rep threads and/or profiles and/or reddit threads.

8. Tips are optional :)

It is at this point that you may all part ways with the transaction complete.

Please read on for how to complete a Moneypak transaction!

*****

***Step 3.1: Using Moneypak instead of Paypal***

[Green Dot Moneypak](http://moneypak.com) is a service that allows buyers in the USA to put an amount of money (usually up to $500) onto a pre-paid card. This card has a code on the back, which can be redeemed for 100% safe Paypal funds through the Moneypak site. This is a great alternative to straight Paypal, because even if someone has no rep, they can buy items using Moneypak with no risk to the seller.

If the seller is not located in the USA, then the code on the back will be irredeemable, meaning you will need a middleman (again, USA resident) to redeem the code and send the cash from his account. I have personally done this for two golden Baby Roshans.

*Note:* it is polite to accept a smaller amount to compensate the buyer for the extra effort of this process.

Follow these steps to complete a Moneypak transfer:

1. Buyer charges a Moneypak card at a retailer such as Walmart, Walgreens, or any other participating store, with the desired amount. 

2. Upon returning home, group chat is set up with the middleman and the buyer/seller.

3. Seller sends the middleman the item(s). Again, beware the [middleman injection scam!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/13072o/psa_trading_reminders_be_careful/)

4. Buyer then sends the seller the Moneypak code from the card. If the seller is non-US, then the code goes to the middleman (who also must be US-based). Seller or middleman redeems the code on Moneypak's site, which transfers the cash to their Paypal account automatically.

5. If the middleman redeemed the code, he then sends the seller the cash over Paypal.

6. Seller confirms that the cash has arrived as expected.

7. Middleman sends the buyer the item(s).

8. Rep is exchanged, drinks are had.

9. Again, tipping optional :)

I will create a 3d rendered image of your description*[1] in return for any International courier (Lockjaw, Drodo or Smeevil).


**So that you know this isn't a scam:**
Here is the most recent image I created. It's a version of ursa with slightly customised armour. It is the level of detail/quality you can expect from the final image if you wish it to be a realistic portrayal.
http://tadmod.deviantart.com/art/Ulfsaar-the-Ursa-Warrior-348179977


Feel free to look at other images I've uploaded to deviantart as well (keep in mind many of them were created years ago!):
http://tadmod.deviantart.com/gallery/


**Details:**
-The image will be rendered at a resolution of your choosing (up to a maximum of 2kx2k*[2])


-The image will contain one hero/character/item/whatever in an environment and pose of your choice (e.g. pudge on a cliff throwing his hook out*[3])


-We will use a middle-man to hold the courier until the purchaser is satisfied with the quality of the image.


-I will give status updates regarding the completion of the image to the purchaser (they may be accompanied by images which will have a watermark on them*[4])


-I will put a scaled-down (resolution) version on my art portfolios, but will not sell it.


-I will retain distribution rights, but will also extend them to the purchaser, so that they may choose to sell the image in any form if they wish.


-I will deliver the image in a week. If I do not, the purchaser may choose to have the courier returned to them.


**Tid-bits**
[1] Within reason. I aim to keep my integrity and won't make a topless female hero. Other than that, pretty much anything is game.  
[2] If you pick a standard desktop resoltion up to (let's say) 1680x1050, I may be able to provide you with multiple renders from other angles.  
[3] You may also choose to have your name tatooed on the character or something of similar description. After all, it is your image!

+ i agreed to buy him the naga siren set in exchange of 5 keys.
+ i asked him to confirm again in the final minute before the purchase and with his confirmation i bought the set from store.
+ he changes his mind during the trade and offered me 4 keys + ward.

Although this may not appear as a scam to some of you, I wasted $8.99 usd for a trade that didn't happen. and i will not get back the money from Steam.

* **ALWAYS** make sure it's me you're dealing with. That means cross-reference my Steam profile with the one listed on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197975564454) to be sure.

[Summary]

I'm offering a service to anyone who has an unusual courier they would like to sell. For the price of nothing, I will make a gif of your courier in action so your potential buyers are even more willing to fork over the keys! I shoot in 720 but gifs are obviously compressed to all hell. I'll ask you how big you want it though, in case you want a mammoth but beautiful file.

//

[Procedure]

Whoever it is that wants the gif done can simply friend me and invite me to a lobby. If I have previously made the same gif and you don't want anything special then I can just give you that (Will not have a ton done right now though). If you want something different like it flying/running across screen that is fine too. You don't have to hand me any of your items or whatever; all's I need is a few good seconds of video, and then 15-20 minutes later you have a screaming hot picture of that sweet sweet item carrier.

Yeah, I'm charging nothing. If you like what I do then you can send me something, but I will definitely not think any differently of you if you don't :P.

*Few notes about Couriers:* 

The Event colour (255,255,255) gets used for specific event couriers that were unboxed before 14/6/2013:

| Number | Name |
|:----|:----|
| 1 | Defense 2 War Dog |
| 2 | Sunfire |
| 3 |Diretide 2012 |
| 4 |Frostivus Frost |
| 5 |Trail Of The Lotus Blossom |
| 6 |Crystal Rift |
| 7 |Cursed Essence |
| 8 |Divine Essence |
| 9 |Trail Of The Amanita |

- **As of 14th June 2013, The Tegu, Baby Roshan, Prismatic Drake, Cluckles The Brave, Nimble Ben, Porcine Princess Penelope, Kupu The Metamorpher and The Llama Llama can have ALL the Unusual Effects (This includes both Standard and Event)** However if they roll an Event effect, the colour code will not be 255,255,255. A noteable exception to this rule is the Navi Weaselcrow, which can only unbox Crystal Rift, Trail Of The Lotus Blossom, Cursed Essence, Divine Essence, And Trail Of The Amanita.

- Itsy, Snowl, Snelfret, Captain Bamboo and Mok got their first Unusual Modifier from Quirt's Summer Stash.

- Please note that event couriers cannot be painted, i have added notes to the affected couriers.

- An Unusual courier will have a purple border in your backpack.

- Stumpy Natures Attendant and Trusty Mountain Yak were recently made Immortal. These couriers come in the Standard Unusuals and Event Unusuals (Up until Trail Of The Amanita) They have since been removed from the loot tables.

- Any courier with a Match ID will contain a unique right click option to watch the replay associated with it.

- Baby Roshan is currently the only standard courier to have a Seasonal tag (Diretide 2012). This was unboxed from the Diretide chest (Series #17).

- There is a Frostivus 2012 Tag, for any courier unboxed from the Frostivus chest (Series #21) This however did not spawn standard couriers like the Diretide chest did.
 
- Wynchell The Wyrmeleon is the first courier in Dota 2 to gain levels.  Levels are obtained for watching a replay of a Premier League match, or joining a match that is live in progress.  As it gains levels the unusual effect get stronger. (Level 25, 50, 75 and Max 100)  If you are going to trade the Wynchell, the current level it has will not be reset. Also if you have multiple Wynchells in your inventory and you watch a replay, all of them will update to the total amount of replays watched.

- The Star Ladder Grillhound follows the same principles however to increase its viewcount you must watch Season V matches or replays.

- Inky The Hexapus follows the same principles however to increase its viewcount you must watch G-1 League matches or replays.

- Maximilian The Beetlebear follows the same principles however to increase its viewcount you must watch Raidcall Dota 2 League Season 3 matches or replays. These couriers however, do not have a unusual effect.

- Cyril The Syrmeleon follows the same principles however to increase its viewcount you must watch The Defense Season 4 matches or replays. These couriers however, do not have a unusual effect.

- El Gato follows the same principles however to increase its viewcount you must watch ANY game that is casted by the BTS (Beyond The Summit) Studio.  This can be with any tournament as long as the BTS team is casting that game. This courier however, instead of having a particle effect has a style unlock system (akin to smeevils) The first style is unlocked at 60 views.

*Some terms that most people use for their couriers and would see on the subreddit:*

**Paintable** - Used for colours which were released in paint form, and can still be unboxed as of this day.

**Unpaintable** - Used for colours which were not released in paint form, and can still be unboxed as of this day.

**Legacy** - Used for colour codes which will be the only one in existence or have a one-of-a-kind code. (I.E Pink, White, Grey) These were only obtainable pre-RGB patch.

**Unique** - Used for colour codes which will be the only one in existence or have a one-of-a-kind code, but will look very similar to a paintable code (I.E Green SE Boar 81, 165, 80) These were only obtainable pre-RGB patch.

**Genuine** - Used for couriers which are purchaseable via the valve store or redeemed from promotional codes (Dolfrat, Braze, Ramnaught, Wynchell The Wyrmeleon [TPL] Starladder Grillhound [SLV] Inky The Hexapus [G-1])

- The Unusual Paint item is a single use item, and once it has been used, cannot be reversed.  

- The Unusual Paint was given out back in June of 2012, due to the removal of the random colour generator producing some less desirable colours. 

- Currently there is very few Unusual Paints in existence, and it is unknown if it will be released again.

- Legacy and Unique are very similar but Unique tends to be used more for a colour that is very close to another but in a different shade. (I.E a Light Red Vs. a Dark Red Vs. a Paintable Red)

The table below is a listing of the most commonly used colours when it comes to trading Non-Legacy couriers:

| **Paintable** | **Unpaintable** |**Unclassified**|
|:--------|:-----------|:----------|
|Red (208, 61, 51) | Violet (130, 50, 207) | Old Blue (50, 166, 207) |
|Gold (207, 171, 49) | Teal (74, 183, 141) | Magenta (196, 57, 198) |
|Orange (208, 119, 51) | Indigo (61, 104, 196) | Persian (41, 36, 203) |
|Blue (0, 151, 206) | Event (255, 255, 255) | |
|Purple (130, 50, 237) | TI3 Effect ( 0, 0, 15) | |
|Green (81, 179, 80) | | |
|Light Green (183, 207, 51) | | |

**Smeevils**

Smeevils were given out as an incentive to buy the 2013 International Compendium. If you redeemed a Compendium on an account, you were given a Smeevil.

- Smeevils gain views similar to tournament couriers for viewing The International 2013 matches and gain a particle effect maxing out at 100 views.

- To unlock a new style, you need to Right click your Smeevil, choose Select Style, cycle to the style you would like to unlock and pick the style you would like. When you select a style that is locked it will tell you what is required to unlock it. Once you unlock a style, it can be switched to at will and is permament, you will not need to reapply any items each time you switch style. Also when you unlock for instance the Purple colour, when you want to make the Dyed Crab, instead of needing 1 Smeevil Treat, 1 Edge Crab Lure and 1 Edge Crab Dye, you will now only need 1 Edge Crab Lure and 1 Edge Crab Dye. 

- These couriers have different styles that can be unlocked using various items that were given out/awarded in various situations: 

1. The Three different colours (Red Yellow and Purple) require 1 Smeevil Treat each.

2. The Mammoth requires the Red colour to be unlocked and a Mammoth Bait.

3. The Bird requires the Yellow colour to be unlocked and a Cleft Hawk's Call.

4. The Crab requires the Purple colour to be unlocked and a Edge Crab Lure.

5. The Dyed Crab requires the Purple colour and the Crab to be unlocked and a Edge Crab Dye.

*The following items are needed to unlock the different styles:*

**1. Smeevil Treat** - Obtained in various manners. The first one was given out when you completed a Compendium Matchmaking game. The second Treat was given for stamping one complete team in the Compendium. The third and final treat was given out for completing five teams in the Compendium.

**2. Mammoth Bait** - Awarded for creating and completing a Fantasy Team in the Compendium. (Found on page 23)

**3. Cleft Hawk's Call** - Awarded for filling out all of the predictions for the Main Event.

**4. Edge Crab Lure** - Awarded for stamping eight teams in the Compendium, this also had a specific ruleset in which you had to complete two of the challenge teams that the book assigned to you. 

**5. Edge Crab Dye** - Awarded for stamping ALL of the teams in the Compendium. (Your progress can be checked on page 31 of the Compendium)

The table below shows each style that can be unlocked and shows the particle effect of each level: (It should be noted that the Mammoth and the Bird currently do not have a particle effect associated to them)

[Bonus Youtube Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpI4wZpvsik&amp;feature=share&amp;list=UUIwpZBbFeoHJKPnwIcS3-rA)

**Disclaimer: All of these Greevils have been made using 3 Unusual Essences.**

Greevils were a part of the Diretide (Halloween) and Frostivus (Christmas) events.  Everyone was given a Greevil Egg, and a custom map was made to collect Essences to fill the egg.  Using the option to rename your Greevil will give it the stock standard ""Greevil"" title.

There were 5 different types of essences:

| Number | Name | 
|:----|:----|
| 1 |Quas Essence (Blue) |
| 2 |Wex Essence (Yellow) |
| 3 |Exort Essence (Red) |
| 4 |Shadow Essence (Black) |
| 5 |Unusual Essence (Not A Colour) |

The different levels of each Colour can be found below:

| Colour | Level and Name |
|:-------|:--------------|
| Red | Brutal = 2 Exort Essence |
| | Merciless = 3 Exort Essence |
| Yellow | Eager = 2 Wex Essence |
| | Spirited = 3 Wex Essence |
| Blue | Resolute = 2 Quas Essence |
| | Determined = 3 Quas Essence | 
| Green | Covetous = 2 Quas + 2 Wex Essence |
| | Greedy = 3 Quas + 3 Wex Essence |
| Orange | Ravenous = 2 Exort + 2 Wex Essence | 
| | Voracious = 3 Exort + 3 Wex Essence |
| Purple | Cruel = 2 Exort + 2 Quas Essence |
| | Wicked = 3 Exort + 3 Quas Essence|
| White | Blessed = 2 Quas + 2 Wex + 2 Exort Essence |
| | Seraphic = 3 Quas + 3 Wex + 3 Exort Essence |
| Black | Dreaded = 1 Shadow Essence |
| Natural | Imbued = 0 Essence
| | Imbued = 1 Quas Or 1 Wex Or 1 Exort Essence |

The type of bodypart you receive was dictated by what essences you used and what amount was placed into your Egg.

| Essence | Bodypart | 
|:---|:---|
| Quas | Nose |
| Wex | Tails |
| Exort | Horns |
| Quas+Wex | Ears |
| Wex+Exort | Teeth |
| Quas+Exort | Hair |
| Quas/Wex/Exort | Eyes |
| Quas/Wex/Exort | Wings |
| Shadow | Feathers |
| Unusual | Particle Effect |

| Level | Ears | Hair | Horns| Nose | Tail | Teeth | Wings | Eyes | Feathers | 
|:------|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|:------|:-----|:---------|
|01   |Perky  | Short | Stubby | Modest | Thin | Simple | Barely Functional | Googly | Shaggy |
|02   |Pointed | Long | Wicked | Hooked | Balanced | Sharp | Functional | | |
|03   | | | Massive | Horned | Spiked | Toothy | Elaborate | | |
|04   | | | Demonic | | Evil | Jagged | Gothic | | |

Note: Level 4 Bodyparts (and Level 1 Feathers) can only be obtained by a Dreaded Egg.

The effect modification was dictated by how much Unusual Essence you added:

| Level | Naked | Merciless | Wicked | Spirited | Voracious | Determined | Greedy | Seraphic | Dreaded | 
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:------|:------|:-----|:---------|
| Name | Naked | Exort | Por | Wex | Flam | Quas | Vas | Sanct | Corp |
| 01 | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air | Air |
| 02 | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience | Ambience |
| 03 | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura | Aura |

1. Air = Slight Aura Colouring

2. Ambience = Eye Modification

3. Aura = Unusual Modifications

Since I moved to dota2, I always had problems loading profile pages,trade windows and other pages and guides through steam browser, since I have a very crappy connection.. I used to load pages much faster on normal browser than the steam one.. So i thought of finding a way to fix it.. 
While searching for solution to this problem I stumbled upon a piece of info, which basically boosts up steam browser loading speeds very drastically and instantly.. 

The Fix is as follows: 
___________________________________________________________

**TL;DR** Control Panel &gt; Internet Options &gt; Connections Tab &gt; LAN Settings &gt; Uncheck Automatically Detect Settings
___________________________________________________________

Windows, for compatibility reasons, has Automatically Detect Proxy settings enabled. It unfortunately adds a significant lag to loading web pages in Steam as well as other internet dependent applications. Nearly no one needs this compatibility feature anymore, worst case if something goes wrong simply re-check the box. To disable this option follow the **TL;DR** at the top.

But I notice now that many users in this subreddit are being silly again.

Making this short and simple. I'm reposting this PSA every 24 hours (or close enough to it) so nobody misses it.

[This] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/182j89/psa_cracking_down_day_3_with_a_few_short_updates/) is now coming back.

The shitposting, price commentating, 12-hour rule-breaking, and smurfing stops here. We've been far too lenient.

Read the [rules and guidelines] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/). 

- If you shitpost or offer unsolicited price commentary, you'll receive a week's ban. This is almost unconditional, and I'm not defining the conditions now. You will receive a week's ban, as defined in the rules.
- If you think somebody's price is bad, ***do not post***. Message them instead through Reddit. This market is capitalistic, so in the end it's still a case of ""let the buyer(s) beware.""
- If you think somebody's thread sucks phenomenally, ***report*** it.
- If you hijack somebody's trade, you will be banned for a week.
- If you break the 12-hour rule, I'm no longer warning you. First ban is 48 hours. Second offense is a week. There's some bit of leniency (for instance, submitting a thread 11 hours after your last thread) but that's about it.
- If you delete a thread to try to bypass the 12-hour rule, you are getting four days.
- Blatant upvote manipulation (scammers or friends) earns you four days.
- If you use a smurf to circumvent the 12-hour rule, shitpost, hijack trades, or blatantly (and stupidly) attempt to manipulate prices, I'm banning the smurf. And when I find your main account, I'm banning that as well.
- SCAMMER, IDEA, and PSA tags are always allowed, as long as it's *actually a public service announcement*. Bad PSAs will be removed, and depending on the severity of infraction might result in a ban. 
- Q and PC tags are tentatively allowable, though abuse of the PC tag (as in an attempt to say ""accepting offers!"" in the PC thread) will result in removal and a ban if the 12-hour rule is being disobeyed. As with Q tags... let's just not ask dumb questions and there shouldn't be a problem. Oftentimes Q tags will just be price checks. Questions ***not related to trading*** will be removed.

It is occuring with tournament items, just earlier on in the day someone was selling off a fake tournament invoker headpiece and he himself had not noticed he ahd been scammed. A lot of people have been making offers on it without really noticing the finer details.

Please be aware of the description of any tournament item you are bidding or buying because Description Tags have a character limit.  Just because it has orange letters does not mean it is not a fake, if you use a tag on a tournament item the text will still be orange.

Steps to Prevent:

1. Always check the Match ID, if it does not match the event being talked about, it is clearly a forgery. (Bugged IDs no longer exist)
2. Carefully check the spelling and grammar of the description.

Example:

##[Picture of a Fake Tournament Item](http://oi47.tinypic.com/23wl05u.jpg)
##[Picture of a Legitimate Tournament Item](http://oi50.tinypic.com/2quugx4.jpg)

##[Picture of a Fake Tournament Item In-Game](http://oi48.tinypic.com/sqrz38.jpg)
##[Picture of a Legitimate Tournament Item In-Game](http://oi48.tinypic.com/jj1abb.jpg)

- NaVi.Dendi scored amazing ULTRA KILL against Pulse in game Starladder IV Dec 1 (Bad grammar, no time tags, no tournament tags)
- Navi.Dendi [Na'Vi] scored an amazing ULTRA KILL against Pulse in a game of #DOTA_Item_Star_Series_Season_IV at 11:33 on Fri Dec 1 05:25:13 2012 (Better grammar, includes teamtag, timestamp, and tournament info)

***

Name and Description tags were recently changed so that you could use them on couriers.

Two potential scams that could arise:

1. Normal Dogs being tagged as Defense 2 Dogs.
2. Roshans being tagged as Golden Roshans.

In order to save yourself from any embarassment if you see someone selling a golden roshan or defense 2 wardog, please ensure you do the following:

- Check the Tags in the backpack
- If the Dog is not Ancient, it is not a Genuine Defense Dog. 
- If the Golden Roshan is not Immortal, it is not a Genuine Golden Roshan
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. (Eg. HAVE GOLD ROSH WANT EF COURIER 1:1 FAST TRADE)
- Check for Visual differences

##[Picture to Illustrate the differences](http://oi45.tinypic.com/29o1j4m.jpg)

TL;DR Please check items before purchase, and be very careful!

Read the [rules and guidelines] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/). 

- If you shitpost or offer unsolicited price commentary, you'll receive a week's ban. This is almost unconditional, and I'm not defining the conditions now. You will receive a week's ban, as defined in the rules.
- If you hijack somebody's trade, you will be banned for a week.
- If you break the 12-hour rule, I'm no longer warning you. First ban is 48 hours. Second offense is a week. There's some bit of leniency (for instance, submitting a thread 11 hours after your last thread) but that's about it.
- If you use a smurf to circumvent the 12-hour rule, shitpost, hijack trades, or blatantly (and stupidly) attempt to manipulate prices, I'm banning the smurf. And when I find your main account, I'm banning that as well.

Please read -- very important!!,musical_hog,74,8,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/19jnya/psa_reminder_flair_bot_is_coming_soon_please_read/,"This is just a reminder that mandatory Steam flair via the SteamBot is coming soon. In fact, we are about **one day away** from being ready to launch.

Below is a copy of my last PSA regarding this issue. **PLEASE READ IT VERY CAREFULLY!**


&gt;***How does it work?***

We will be using a new bot called SteamBot. By visiting the start page at http://trade.redditgaming.com/start (NOTE: VISITING THIS PAGE FOR THE TIME BEING WILL DO NOTHING FOR YOU ON THIS SUBREDDIT; IT WILL ONLY MAKE YOU AN APPROVED SUBMITTER ON /R/TF2TRADE), you will be able to link your Reddit account to your Steam account thanks to the web APIs for both sites. Upon completion of these **two simple clicks**, SteamBot will make you an approved submitter for the subreddit. This link is permanent and cannot be changed, so you are only allowed one registration per Steam account. We will be using a modified subdomain of the link above, so please watch for this announcement when it is time to launch.

&gt;***Why does this subreddit need to enforce Steam flair?***

We need it because, right now, anyone can create any number of accounts and horribly abuse the upvote/downvote system and/or post anonymously even when marked as a SCAMMER on SteamRep. We need this transparency to eliminate these problem users. Impersonation is also a problem on this subreddit and others, and this system will almost entirely eliminate that problem.

&gt;***I already have flair. Do I still need to do this?***

Yes. You will be forced to link your **one** reddit account to your **one** Steam account. This will be mandatory to post ***and*** comment on this subreddit.

&gt;***When can I expect this system to roll out?***

Within two weeks, but likely sooner. **Update: we will be launching within 48 hours.** Users here will have 30 days from the launch of the bot on this subreddit to set up their Steam flair until approved submitter status will be **required** to post comments or threads.

&gt;***Who can I thank for this dark magic?***

/u/drkabob is the coding wizard behind this bit of code sorcery. You are encouraged to tell him how big his muscles are and how handsome he is.

Details inside.,musical_hog,76,7,311,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14gaas/psa_community_vote_transparency_should_we_enforce/,"So the issue of enforcing Steam flair on every trade post has come up a few times, most recently with [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14ewtm/q_can_we_please_mandate_flair_or_steam_profile/), and given its relative popularity, I've decided to move forward.

Enforcing transparency is going to be a difficult task, but it will benefit the community as a whole because it will cut down on the number of alt accounts being used to 

1. manipulate market prices, as in the case of hooks and unusuals

2. streamline the trading process so you need only click a button to add someone or check their pack

3. force the lurking scammers out into the open or further into hiding.

I understand that not everyone will be in favor of this motion, because not everyone wants to be pestered about every item in their inventory all the time, which is why I am going to leave this to a vote.

I was hesitant at first, but decided to go ahead and do it, as long as the money was sent as a gift for virtual goods with no charge back. So he ""sends the money"" and tells me to check email for paypal verification. 

I was already at the paypal website waiting for the funds to arrive, and he said it might take a couple hours for it to go through because he is in germany and the currency is different etc.

So i check the email and find this:

The Vintage Season 2 Defense War Dog :) I've had him for quite some time now but wanted to wait for the right time to put him on the market. Statistic wise this dog is one of two that exist, The other vintage is owned by zoid who i believe is a developer.   
  
 This auction is not open to just everybody, As it is unique the price is high and the scams wont be happening so **the only bids that will be allowed are bids by exemplary traders with fantastic rep**.   
  
If the price of this courier gets too high then we will need to discuss an alternative way on how i'm going to get the money. We will be using Moneypak **not** paypal. I am looking for **MONEY ONLY** not other couriers or tb's or anything of that nature. If you feel that you need to offer me a lesser item then i will undervalue it. What i mean by that is i dont plan on selling a ton of items to get a good amount of money so if i accept an item trade it will be sold for much less then you would normally sell it for so it could be sold quickly.   
  
This Auction will last until april 5th (Two weeks from now) and will have a middle man by the name of Hammy http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197975564454  I will give hammy a good amount of cash and as i expect you to be a good trader i can assume you will also throw the man something nice as well. He is the /r/dota2trade admin and here is his rep thread  
  
 http://forums.sourceop.com/threads/71062-Hammy-s-rep-middleman-thread  
  
If the trade is greater then 6000 then we will need to talk other possibilities because thats a serious chunk of change. I live in texas so high bidders in texas, Oklahomos, and Louisiana   are encouraged to bid.
  
Lets see this beauty of a courier shall we?

For example put in: rampage into search field on community market and currently there are 4 items. All of them are fakes. 

Sellers simply change low tier tournament items with bad teams and double kills to something like this: 

&gt; NaVi.XBOCT [NaVi] scored a legendary RAMPAGE, killing every member of [IG]

[Here is example - click to go to community market with ""rampage"" as search](http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?q=rampage)

However if you check match ID in game - it either not resolve at all, or will show you real game ID which will be something like FOTA vs 3Dmax double kill and stuff like that.

&gt; **DO NOT buy any tournament items before you actually check them in-game and make sure they are what they are. Or you can see below for alternative method.** 

Here is how you can check it: in dota 2 open WATCH menu &gt; then click filter &gt; then enter match ID number you find in items description &gt; click APPLY. That's it. If it doesn't show you team and players that are on description then the item is fake. 

I already reported this to steam, perhaps they can make it so descriptions don't work(I did not try if they work now, but I don't see how else someone can change description then). 

*Thanks and due diligence anything that you are buying.*


&gt; **update**
&gt; AONomad:
&gt; MUCH EASIER WAY TO CHECK: a real tournament tag will include the name of the tournament and the date of the drop, for example:
dignitas.@Aui_2000 [dignitas] denied his ally dignitas.TidesofTime [dignitas] in a game of #DOTA_Item_The_Premier_League_Season_4 at 16:41 on Mon Mar 18 13:53:10 2013.
This cannot be done with a description tag as there are not enough characters to include all the information. If the tag of something you're buying has names/teams + tournament + date, it is unaltered and real.

**2) [Pegleg Of The Cursed Pirate](http://i.imgur.com/HDXgg5Y.jpg) (Kunkka)**

While this is merely a very old common item, it actually has a custom walk animation.  When he walks with the pegleg he walks with a limp (As you would expect) This isnt listed anywhere on the item!

*Summary:*

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_RUN""

**03) [Ancestors' Pride Set] (http://i.imgur.com/Ww2vFee.jpg) (Phantom Lancer)**

This one is pretty simple in that it has a Custom Loadout Stance (Someone was pestering me to add this one!)

This one is not as uncommon as the others, as people know about the different loadout stance and the death animation. But its also the only item to have a custom Victory animation. (He will throw one blade up into the air and catch it)

**07) [Sparrowhawk Set](http://i.imgur.com/78BiPKl.jpg) (Windrunner)**

It is common knowledge that there are custom animations for her attacks, and skills when using this set (Hell, its even noted on the items itself).  What is not noted is that there is also a custom death animation (She will fall backwards and drop her Bow)

**08) [Slim Blade Of The Tahlin Watch](http://i.imgur.com/x3Rlj1H.jpg) And [Whip Of The Subtle Demon](http://i.imgur.com/OAj7cZR.jpg) (Riki)**

It is known that the Subtle Demon set has a custom Loadout Stance (or is it?)  What may not be known is that for these 2 tail weapons they will create a custom attack animation.  Sometimes when he attacks he will do a spin flick with his tail instead of using the blades in his hands.

**09) [Armor Of The Sanguine Moon](http://i.imgur.com/Ba4y67k.jpg) (Lycanthrope)**

This one would not be common knowledge at all.  Whilst this set gives a Custom Loadout it also does something else! When wearing this eyepatch the animation for summoning wolves changes.  The default animation is for him to throw two arms out (Similar to wolverine when he unleashes his claws)  However when using the Patch, he will just throw out his right arm.

*Summary:*

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_LOADOUT""
					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_1""

**10) [The Dead Winter Soul](http://i.imgur.com/sVmRJef.jpg) (Lich)**

This one also would not be common knowledge.  When wearing the Soul item, the animation for his ultimate changes.  The default animation is for Lich to throw the ultimate out using his right hand. However when using the Soul, he will throw it out using both hands (Similar to Goku throwing the spirit bomb).

*Summary:*

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_4""

**11) [The Instagib OSP](http://i.imgur.com/lpL7yjr.jpg) (Sniper)**

This one is more commonly known as its a new item.  When wearing the Instagib the animation for his ultimate changes.  The default animation is for sniper to stand still and aim through the sight before shooting.  However when using the Instagib, he will lay down to the ground and aim like the true sniper he is.  This is actually a bit of a giveaway for less experienced players to know when hes ulting (Veterans will just use the debuff to know how long before youre being shot)

*Summary:*

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_4""

**12) [The Silent Ripper](http://i.imgur.com/S2yO6sX.jpg) (Slark)**

This one is also more commonly known.  When wearing The Silent Ripper the animation for his Pounce ability will change.  The default animation is for slark to do a flip towards the target.  However when using The Silent Ripper, he will spin around in a circle (Getting dizzy anyone?!)

*Summary:*

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_SLARK_POUNCE""
					""modifier""		""silent_ripper""
					""frequency""		""1""

**13) [Scythe Of Twin Deaths](http://i.imgur.com/QcHAeWh.jpg) (Necrolyte)**

This is noted on the item but is hard to tell whats going on.  The default animation is that he swings his scythe towards them before the cast goes off.  However when using the Scythe Of Twin Deaths, he will spin in a 360 degree circle before the ult casts.

*Summary:*

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_4""

**14) [The Corpse Maiden Set](http://i.imgur.com/CLbi52b.jpg) (Death Prophet)**

This one is noted on the items but doesnt list exactly what its changing, each item changes different things! The Scarf changes your Silence Animation (She holds her hand up to her face in a hush motion) and the Collar changes most of your attack animations.

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_ATTACK""
					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_ATTACK2""
					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_4""

					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_2""
					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_ATTACK2""
					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_CAST_ABILITY_4""

This means that the Collar by itself gives a custom attack animation, but if worn in conjunction with the Scarf, gives another secondary custom attack animation! Woowee, two for one! 

**15) [Stinger](http://i.imgur.com/q0tbAHc.jpg) And [Lyraleis Breeze](http://i.imgur.com/qoDVX5x.jpg) (Windrunner)**

Both of these bows say they have custom animations, but also they have attack animation changes!:

What is the ""Attack Event"" string about you might ask?  I dont know, do you? :(

**17) [Sacred Bones Set](http://i.imgur.com/P9FsAla.jpg) (Huskar)**

Custom loadout stance and custom death animation! When Huskar dies he will die like a boss and fall back dropping his manly spear.

*Summary:*


					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_LOADOUT""
					""asset""		""ACT_DOTA_DIE""

**18) [Eye Of Omoz](http://i.imgur.com/oRAIBGq.jpg) (Doom)**

This weapon is the only Singular item to change both the Attack Animation and the Loadout Stance. Doom will lunge at his enemy with his sword in a stabbing motion like a fencer would instead of swinging his sword.

*Summary:*

I am unable to list unique legacy couriers for obvious reasons but would love to have them included.

This is going to take a while. :P Add me up if you can spare 5 minutes and have those couriers or want me to make a video for you. I don't need you to trade me the couriers, I can just record in a custom lobby game. :) http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerye

*Few notes about wards:*

- Wards have hero themes but can be used by any hero.

- The enemy team will not be able to see your wards or their animation (Unless they sentry you, or have a gem)

Feedback would be appreciated, thanks everyone!

##DragonClaw Hook

* Match ID: 132355723 and [Screenshot] (http://i48.tinypic.com/23m4e90.jpg) for when hook was still mythical!

* **According to [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/191tw3/psa_dragonclaw_hook_is_now_immortal/), after the 9MB Patch, hook rarity is changed to IMMORTAL now! So the question is did valve removed hook from drop list or not! Help me out here to make it clear!**

* [This Screenshot] (http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=128959471) of the hook drop is **Not a valid proof** because it has the match ID of the hook that dropped before the 9MB patch (the match ID mentioned above), and now if you download and watch its replay, it'll show it as immortal.

* According to [this link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/191357/psa_list_of_all_items_added_to_random_drop_system/c8jyb65) this items drops as a Frost Spikes Bundle and when opened it gives Frost Spikes and Ice Burst Cloak.

‌

##Dire &amp; Radiant HUD

I'm reposting this PSA every 24 hours (or close enough to it) so nobody misses it.

The shitposting, price commentating, 12-hour rule-breaking, and smurfing stops here. We've been far too lenient.

Read the [rules and guidelines] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/). 

- If you shitpost or offer unsolicited price commentary, you'll receive a week's ban. This is almost unconditional, and I'm not defining the conditions now. You will receive a week's ban, as defined in the rules.
- ***NEW*** - If you think somebody's price is bad, ***do not post***. Message them instead through Reddit. This market is capitalistic, so in the end it's still a case of ""let the buyer(s) beware.""
- ***UPDATED*** - If you think somebody's thread sucks phenomenally, ***report*** it.
- If you hijack somebody's trade, you will be banned for a week.
- If you break the 12-hour rule, I'm no longer warning you. First ban is 48 hours. Second offense is a week. There's some bit of leniency (for instance, submitting a thread 11 hours after your last thread) but that's about it.
- If you use a smurf to circumvent the 12-hour rule, shitpost, hijack trades, or blatantly (and stupidly) attempt to manipulate prices, I'm banning the smurf. And when I find your main account, I'm banning that as well.
- ***NEW*** - SCAMMER, IDEA, and PSA tags are always allowed, as long as it's *actually a public service announcement*. Bad PSAs will be removed, and depending on the severity of infraction might result in a ban. 
- ***NEW*** - Q and PC tags are tentatively allowable, though abuse of the PC tag (as in an attempt to say ""accepting offers!"" in the PC thread) will result in removal and a ban if the 12-hour rule is being disobeyed. As with Q tags... let's just not ask dumb questions and there shouldn't be a problem. Oftentimes Q tags will just be price checks. Questions ***not related to trading*** will be removed.

From my end, a ban first, ask questions later approach will be employed. If you want to appeal a ban, message the moderators--link is on the right hand side, near the ""moderators"" box.

I don't care what you think the price of a Golden Greevil should be. I don't care if you think somebody is asking for too much (unless it's absolutely ludicrous, such as ""[H] GG [W] Hook"" or too little--""[H] common [W] GG""). Be polite and civil. Instead of flaming or ***offering price commentary***, just report instead.

***UPDATED*** Quit with the ""upvoted for fair price"" and ""LOL GOOD LUCK"" shenanigans as well. If I see those posts, I'm just going to remove them. If you must upvote, *please* do so because you actually think it's a fair price.

Again, [read the rules and guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/).

1355177513.0,48,self.Dota2Trade,14mmby,[STORE] The first ever Random Item Bot,Coffman34,58,10,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14mmby/store_the_first_ever_random_item_bot/,"Along the lines of TF2 Scrapbanking bots, I bring you a Dota 2 Random Item bot.

It's very quick and easy to use.

**1. Make sure your inventory is set to public.**

**2.** Add rcoffman34 or dota2bot2 to your friends list. Their names will have the format [AutomatedBot]Dota2 Bot #.

**3.** Initiate a trade with the bot. The bot will send you messages on how to use it. Or see below.


**To use the bot:**


Add 3 of a item rarity, then type !tradeup to receive 1 item of 1 level rarity higher. You put in 3 commons, you get 1 uncommon. You put in 3 uncommons, you get 1 rare, etc.


Add 1 item, then type !tradedown to receive 2 items of 1 level rarity lower. You put in 1 uncommon, you receive 2 commons. You put in 1 rare, you receive 2 uncommons, etc.


Some things to keep in mind:


The bots are very busy. I am working on adding more.

The bots have a timer, you cannot take more than 360 seconds before it will cancel the trade.

The bots have an idle timer, if you don't take an action within 60 seconds, it will cancel.

If no one will !tradedown, then, eventually no one can !tradeup. I have dumped all my items of higher rarity in the bots inventory, once they are gone, that's it, until people add more. So help keep these bots going.

You CAN'T trade essences, keys, chests, or anything that ISN'T equipment.

The bot has pseudo-random item giving. If you put an item in, and don't like what it gives, you can't take it out, and place another item in. The order of items is determined when the bot loads. It will trade items in that order, until the item is off the list, then it will change the item.


If you have any issues, add COFFMAN34. DO NOT add COFFMAN34 attempting to trade with the bot, that is my main steam account.


**You can now trade multiple items, as well as multiple rarities. You CANNOT mix !tradeup or !tradedown.**

I have had to remove all friends from the bots since some users are unable to read the directions, and continue to attempt to trade the bots with private backpacks. Now, when you add the bot as a friend, it will message you stating you need to have a public inventory. This is a temporary fix until I can get the problem sorted out with the private inventory.

So, **if you see the bots offline, try to add them again.** Their friends list were getting rather full also. So I have had to make it so that it removes a user after trading from it's friends list. You will have to add them to your friends list again to trade again.

Non-paint colors are colors neither legacy nor from a paint. That is, a color that still drops but is not identical to a paint.

Paint colors are colors identical to paints. So a courier with a color identical to a paint might have came from a drop or from somebody painting it.

I've created a website that allows you to keep track of what cosmetic items you have and what you are missing. Also, if you just want to know what's out there, it provides a nice way of filtering items by rarity, slot, and hero.

Friends,

/r/dota2trade has been such a pleasure to watch grow. We have really taken off much faster than anyone could have anticipated. I love watching the # on the sidebar grow each day.

That said, let's get down to brass tacks.

**Some important rule reminders for our new users (and old!):**

* *Post tags are the #1 reason why your posts get removed by mods. Make sure you understand how to use each one. For example, your post will be removed if you put the [W] first! It will also be removed if you use lower-case letters ([h]/[w]). Additionally, do not make up tags without the mods' permission. Lately, the [Idea] tag was used for an essence swap thread. That was a great idea, but it was run by us first!*

* *[Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if your post has not appeared in the /new/ queue after five minutes. We will fish it out, as long as it adheres to the rules.*

* *Do not violate the 12-hour posting rule. Once per twelve hours. There are rare exceptions, but you must have extraordinary circumstances in order to make this happen. If you violate this rule, you will be subject to a ban of variable length.*

* *Be respectful of other users. If someone rejects your offer, kindly thank them for considering it and move on. Do not belittle or berate someone else. This goes especially for owners of the baby Golden Roshan. Enough already! Additionally, when you comment on someone else's prices without their consent, that's a rule violation. Do not do it!*

* *Do not use multiple accounts to post here. One is plenty. We ban alts of known users.*

That about sums up the most frequently broken rules, so please do yourself a favor and re-familiarize yourself with the rules!

*****

Now on to the **fun** stuff.

I have some leftover items from the 2000-user raffle, so I need to give them away! Until **12:00EST, Nov. 9**, I will be accepting donations *on one of my alternate Steam accounts* so that my main does not get a backlog of friend requests. I already have 290+ friends, and the limit is 300.

**[HERE IS THE LINK TO MY ALT](http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamspare)**

Please do not trade anything without first confirming that it is my account. You will find [my main](http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnataur) on the friends list of this alt. I can and will also PM you from reddit to confirm that it is me you are donating to.

The raffle will be conducted at 1:00PM EST **live** from the [/r/dota2trade Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/rugcdota2trade) chat room. Join the group and check it out!

***In order to participate in this raffle, post the following in the comments section:***

&gt; 5000 before 2013!

I will be using RedditRaffle to randomly choose winners. If your name is drawn, you have 48 hours to claim your prize (I will post a separate results thread), at which point I will randomly choose another user as a winner. Please only add my alt to friends if you win.

Please stop using alts. It's really obnoxious and creates a lot of work for moderators. I removed a user earlier who had created something like ten or eleven alts on which to post. This behavior is **unacceptable**. Rules and banishments are in place for a reason, which is to create order. When you dodge bans and break rules, it creates a more chaotic environment for everyone.

Mods have methods of identifying problem users and we are serious about cracking down on these users. If you are one of them, I highly suggest you stick to one account and play by the rules, or you will find that 1.) you will be unable to post here under any account, and/or 2.) your Steam account may be subject to a [CAUTION] or [SCAMMER] mark on SteamRep, depending on the severity of the infraction.

I would like to address some key issues such as price fluctuations, manipulation and poorly done PSA's.

First of all prices WILL fluctuate as they start hitting the market, the prices of new items will be erratic and determined by as much as buyers are willing to pay for them. I've stayed up all night watching these threads, they're jumping all over the place. However, while the prices are unwarranted and unstable, do NOT crash other people's thread with price commentary. While friendly advice over information about where items are obtained or what they're selling for, respect the OP and their threads. Buyers Beware. 

Manipulation of prices is strictly prohibited. If anyone is caught manipulating prices (Fake trades, spreading lies to promote their own greed, etc.) they will be dealt with. Simple. We're trying to improve the sub not devolve it. I would rather stamp out any unfair and shady behavior.

Now for PSA's, I've read the latest few PSA, while most of them are in good order, some have been somewhat lackluster in terms of quality and intentions. A PSA is to inform the general public about information surfaced in an objective manner. Not sensationalist titles with personal bias; Keep it factual. 

Example : *Current Couriers do not have Unusual Tags.* It's fact that they have no unusual tags, whether or not it's intended or bugged is a speculation, keep that opinion out of the titles. You can SPECULATE under comments, but make sure you make it clear that it's your speculation. There are a couple of users that are trying to take advantage of this confusion maliciously, USE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENT.  

To keep everyone updated, I will compile all the facts into one useful PSA soon. Enjoy the latter of the event week. If you have any issues or questions feel free to pm me. 

**TL;DR** : Buyers beware, prices are unstable and fluctuating. Manipulation of prices will be dealt with, and keep PSA's informative and factual.

1  
--------------------------------  
The amount of trade bans happening is frightening.  
Today I did a trade that involved keys too, and after it was completed I realized that I might run into heavy problems, as I read that another 2 people in my friendlist got trade banned.  
I for myself will take a step back. Just checking where your items come from doesn't seem to be enough anymore.  
My advice: If you want to keep your account / be allowed to trade, only do must-trades. It's ALWAYS risky, doesn't matter if too good to be true or if it's about making a key profit or two, step back.
2  
--------------------------------   
Phishing sites and social engineers getting better every day. Be extremely careful, extremely! If you have ANY kind of doubts, instantly change your most important passwords, e-mail, steam etc, and shut down internet connection or something, or it might already be too late.  A friend of mine just got his account stolen, he has no idea how. I say a phishing site but he says it isn't. He lost golden roshan, tournament drodo &amp; smeevil and a massive amount of tournament items. 
3  
--------------------------------  
Protect your E-mail (and Steam!) accounts. For a month already, everyday I login to my E-mail address I'm seeing ~100 failed login attempts. If this e-mail is stolen, my Steam account is stolen. But I am luckiely(!) protected well enough by a strong password. Do not underestimate this. People might get your E-mail in some way, social engineers are extremely well in stealing information without you even noticing.

I am a starving college student, and I really would love to get some pizza for dinner. I have not really eaten today, so that would be pretty rad.   

I have a DotA2 invite that I am willing to exchange: this DotA2 Invite was acquired by a sponsor who went to Valve HQ and got a giant stack of them. They were at my University's LAN (GatorLAN) this past week. [They look like this](http://imgur.com/a/DBEhE)    

In the area, there is a Papa Johns, so if you are interested, please just comment. Then we can do a code exchange !   

If you want, when I have more money, I can also mail you the card itself. . . but it might be a month before I can.   

Thanks a bunch, guys.  

edit:

/u/empathfirstclass mentioned that with Papa Johns, the code 25off gives you 25% off ! That is pretty rad, and even if you do not trade with me, use it in the future for your own cheesy cowabunga goodness.  

I was also told of an ongoing promo right now as well: for the next three days, if you are part of their membership club, you can do the following for a free pizza next order:  

* Order $10 or more online from 9/5 through 9/16 using the special promo code NBCPAPA (see below if you need help using Papa John's promo codes)  

* THE DAY AFTER the order for $10 or more using the special promo code NBCPAPA 25 bonus Papa Rewards points will be deposited into your account.  

* AFTER you have received your 25 bonus points, use the regular Papa Rewards promo code (25PAPA) to redeem the points for a FREE PIZZA by end of day on Sunday, 9/30.  

* If you don't redeem the 25 bonus points by end of day on Sunday, 9/30, they will expire from your account (other points you have earned will remain in your account).

The answer: we’re all giant assholes and we love free stuff. This New Year's however, Reaverxai along with Chroneus and Capgrass decided to change that first part and spread New Year's cheer through a Dota 2 New Year's Contest, where we will be giving out free stuff to anyone who would like to enter!

The prizes are as follows:

**Grand Prize:**

* Bastion Announcer Pack

**2nd-4th Place:**

* Witchslayer Code (Includes Dota 2 Invite)

**5th-7th Place:**

Choice of a Frostivus Pack:

* Frostivus PudgeKnight Pack (Bloodstained Britches, Ember Edge)
* Frostivus JuggHunter Pack (Mask of Fulminant Rage, Mask of Dark Ferocity)
* Frostivus NecrOgre Pack (Direstone Liferipper, Ignited Scepter)

**8th-20th Place:**

* 75% 3-day Battle Bonus

**The Rules:**
To enter, you must leave a comment below from a reddit account older than one week, guessing a number between 1-5,000. And, if you feel like it, drop us a few sentences telling your favourite Dota story of 2012!

I'll be using WolframAlpha to pick 20 random numbers between 1-5,000 on the ~~5th of January~~. **EDIT:** I'm slightly changing how this works. The contest will close on the 2nd, and, if I have time, I'll announce winners on the 2nd as well. Otherwise, winners will be announced on the 5th when I get back. (apologies for the delay, but I'm on a trip until then). If one of the randomly picked numbers wasn't picked, the closest person will win. If two people are equal distance away, I'll flip a coin to find who wins. A new thread will be made with the winners after they are chosen! If two or more people choose the same number, I'll flip more coins.

I'm here to tell you that you can thank Russian scammers for that.

This is how it works:

1. A person steals credit card info from a victim (typically the elderly or the naive) using bogus websites or by hacking. 

2. That person logs onto Dota 2 (used to be TF2 but they found out Dota 2 was more profitable) and buys Dota 2 treasure keys at the regular price.

3. They then trade for high-tier items and sell them at massive discounts or sell the keys at massive discounts. But remember, they bought these items with money that wasn't theirs so they still make pure profit, except now that profit is practically untraceable. They legitimately give the items. They know that scamming traders will attract attention so most times the buyer does get the items he purchased and is not cheated outright.

This stumpy man... I tell ya what. I couldn't believe it. The way he tells me it happened like this: So these two fine #$@ sisters came up (probably lesbian) - one was named Lina and the other was named Rylai. Anyways, they come up to this particular Stumpy at the Xmas tree farm he's been hangin' out at, trying to find a hottie. (insert ""wood joke"".)
So anyways, they're all like ""WE WANT THIS TREE FOR CHRISTMAS!"" So this dude comes over with an axe (his name was Axe) and is like ""Cool, that'll be 22 keys and I'm gonna chop him down and throw him in your Bimmer (they drove a BMW).""
Anyways, this Stumpy says ""f that, I'm outtie."" He pops a Haste rune from his bottle since he was out of Jack Daniels and splits the scene.  Then the two sisters started making out with each other. 
Anyways, he came to my house and is just ""sleeping"".
Little does he know I'm also planning on selling him for 15 keys.
Thanks for the interest!
Sincerely, 
Bane.

1364961268.0,39,self.Dota2Trade,1bkeks,"[Discussion] Why the market is ""crashing""",AONomad,55,16,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1bkeks/discussion_why_the_market_is_crashing/,"There's been a fair amount of concern recently given the deflationary cycle we seem to be experiencing. Timebreakers, Hooks, even TI2 couriers are suffering from lower offers. A few people have asked me if I think the market is crashing, or if they should cash out--the simple answer to both is, No. The complex answer: keys are becoming scarcer.

Before anyone assumes scarcity is bad, I'll just quickly point out: ***this is absolutely Valve's plan***. They are controlling every aspect of the economy and it is clear that the current price ""crash"" is a conscious effort on their part. So, in a nutshell, [DON'T PANIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrases_from_The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy#Don.27t_Panic).

The reason for this change in economic direction isn't entirely clear, but how they are accomplishing it is:

* Rarest Rarities chest - finally a chest worth opening

* Reintroduction of old community chests - fractures availability of normal keys, people buy all kinds now, and not for trade usually

* Anuxi chest - best selling key on the Dota 2 store for a reason, again, being used to open chests

* [Mysterious mass purchases on the Steam Market](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1awmuv/q_interestingsuspicious_activity_on_community/) - probably wasn't Valve, but still contributing to the key shortage

* Increased use of stolen credit cards to buy keys and scam - keys used to scam are deleted regardless of whether or not they were paid for ([see here for more info](http://dota2traders.com/threads/getting-trade-bans.53549/))

* Keys on the Steam Market are now selling out at up to $2.49 - as of this posting, there are none available below $2.51

* [Bitcoins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin) are becoming increasingly popular, leading to a rise in price (bank crisis in Cyprus also contributing to it) - many high-end traders are quickselling their Dota inventories in order to buy BTC given their excellent returns on investment in both short and long term

* Sidenote: I spoke with /u/flamewheel and he pointed out that many of these reasons (in particular the Bitcoin phenomenon) are mirrored in the TF2 economy.

Everything boils down neatly to: no one has keys--not traders, not investors, not key sellers. Here's a quick snippet from my conversation with flamewheel (published with permission):

flamewheel: one of the guys on my list

flamewheel: was looing for old keys

flamewheel: i told him 1.80

flamewheel: he said ""i saw a bunch of 1.70s""

flamewheel: told him to go try

flamewheel: 25 minutes later, comes back

flamewheel: says ""yep couldn't find any with keys""

(update 1 hour later: flamewheel out of stock)

----

I won't speculate as to why Valve wants to make keys rarer, but a direct result is that key prices are rising (and will continue to rise). I am posting this since it is my impression that many people are worried about the current state of affairs, so hopefully this helps shed some light on the current patterns.

Working for so long and never receiving any payment can begin to wear down even the toughest of all spirits and some may even begin to form a glint of gold envy in their eye and want nothing to keep it all for themselves, even having the midas touch cannot satiate their hunger.

This included x0, x1, x2, and x3 variants.  I finished recording most of them, but was stuck with about ten left to do.  

Do you guys still want to see a video showing off the the differences between the x0, x1 and x2 unusual effects?  I already put up a video on x3.  

If you do want to see the evolution of unusual effects then I will need to find people with the following couriers to finish the video.  

- ~~Naked Greevil 1 Unusual~~
- Naked Greevil 2 Unusuals
- Red Greevil 2 Unusuals
- ~~Yellow Greevil 1 Unusual~~
- Yellow Greevil 2 Unusuals
- ~~Blue Greevil 2 Unusuals~~
- ~~Green Greevil 1 Unusual~~
- ~~Green Greevil 2 Unusuals~~
- ~~Purple Greevil 2 Unusuals~~
- ~~White Greevil 2 Unusuals~~

Also, I've heard there's a difference in 0/0/0 naked unusuals and 1/1/1 (or even 1/0/0) imbued naked unusuals.  If anyone has the ability to show me the differences I'd be happy to include footage.

If you can help all you need to do is meet me in a custom lobby, and purchase a normal and flying version for me to use in-game.  Then all I'll need is 1-2 minutes to record, and we'll be done.  If you want to participate leave me your Steam name / account link so I can add you. :)

There are quite a few of ways people scam others, some which may be very clever and hard to notice, even when using a middleman!

So basically, there's this scam technique called the ""injection scam"". How does it work? Well, basically, if someone is a member of a steam group other people in that group can invite you to trade/chat/play and what not. Now, let's suppose you're in the middle of a trade, you've got your middle man ready, seller/buyer waiting for the call when you get an invite trade from whom appears to be the middle man. You give the middle man the item you're going to trade and so on. BUT WAIT A MOMENT THERE! If you weren't careful enough, someone in one of your steam groups may have posed himself to be the middle man (changing his nickname and avatar) and just received your item, thus scamming you. This person probably was in contact with the other guy involved in the trade. How can you avoid this? Check for confirmation on his profile, open it up and verify his name and ID, verify he's on your actual friend list, and everything else you can verify before you blindly trade it in.

Now, as well, I wanted to remind you guys (and let you know if you weren't aware of) musical_hog, MadMatt and myself do offer middle man services in this subreddit. You can just message us directly or the moderators in general to see if anyone's available at the moment. No charge by the way as well, so don't worry about that.

Now, that's all I have to say for the moment so, yeah. Bye.

Thanks HelenAngel :)


It seems there have been several people complaining that their accounts were trade locked/trade banned after receiving stolen or hijacked items. This guide gives some tips on how to avoid this. Like any guide, it is just meant to be a suggestion.


1. If it looks like the deal is too good to be true, it probably is. In real-life, would you buy a stereo easily worth $600 for the low low price of $50 out of the back of some guy's van? Of course not- that's just common sense. Apply that same sense to trading. If someone is ""quick-selling"" promos/unusuals/keys for well below their market value and needs to sell them fast, it may be because the account is hijacked or it is someone unloading stolen items.

2. Don't buy backpacks. When a person gets hijacked, what does the hijacker usually do? If you said move all or most of the items out of the person's backpack into another, you would be correct! So when you buy backpacks, especially for Paypal, you are putting yourself at risk two-fold:
a) You look like a hijacker
b) You become a magnet for a hijacker looking to unload stolen goods quickly.

3. Do not do Paypal trades with unverified Paypal accounts. This is trading 101. Hijackers will often use unverified Paypal accounts. Chargeback scammers often use them as well. So that's two good reasons to not do Paypal trades with them.

4. Avoid ""quick-sells"". Ask yourself why a person is trying to sell an item for much lower than its current value as quickly as possible. Consider the motivations of why the person is quick-selling these items.

5. Check the number of scammers on a person's friends list and when those scammers were added as friends. If you see the person has 4 marked scammers as friends and they were all added in the last day or two, this is a pretty good hint that the account may be compromised.

6. When in doubt, ask... or just don't do the trade. If you even have the slightest inkling that an account might be hijacked, ask a community admin. We are here to help! We may not be able to tell you definitively, but we have seem enough of these cases that we usually have a pretty good idea of the signs of a compromised account. Also, if you have a gut feeling that there is something amiss about the trade, there may be very well be. NEVER do a trade if you get a bad feeling about it!

Yes, you may need to change your trading habits to prevent this. However, a little slice of prevention is always worth it in the end.

Also: ALWAYS USE A MIDDLEMAN AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE REAL.    
   
Too many people are losing items to impersonators.

1. You give me your order (how many you want) on this thread
2. You deposit your keys to a [trusted middle man, musical_hog](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magnataur/) (I have already spoken to him yesterday and he has agreed to do this).
3. I collect all orders here (after I confirmed you deposited) and purchase the items on Thursday (closing orders on Dec 6th noon, central time in USA; please have orders and deposits in by then or else we won't make the order for you).
4. I will post tracking information as it becomes available.
5. I will activate the code and steam trade you the items. Then the middle man will give me your keys.

I may do this for the drow bow or wyvernguard as later if it becomes available. If anyone wants other stuff with unlock codes via the secret shop (like denizen or dolfrat), I'm not really interested in buying those now but if you make a good enough offer I may do it.


## TL;DR: I am taking orders for Zonkey, you deposit keys to [musical_hog](http://steamcommunity.com/id/Magnataur/), we will steam trade you the Zonkey when we get it.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Hola All,

I am an employee and administrator of reddit.com. There has been a recent flurry of incidents surrounding the e-sports related subreddits that need to be addressed.

The problem I'm referring to is 'vote cheating'. Vote cheating simply means that something is inorganically being done to manipulate votes on a post or comment. There aren't many site-wide rules on reddit, but one of them is ""do not engage in vote cheating or manipulation"". Here are some examples of what vote cheating tends to look like:

* Emailing a submission to a group of friends, coworkers, or forest trolls and asking them to vote.
* Engaging in voting 'cliques', where a group of accounts consistently and repeatedly votes on specific content.
* Asking for upvotes on reddit, teamliquid, twitter, facebook, skype, etc.
* Using services or bots to automate mass voting.
* Asking people watching your stream to go upvote/downvote someone or something.

The reason this rule exists is we want to ensure, to the best of our ability, that there is a level playing field for all submissions on reddit. No submission should have more or less of a chance of being seen due to manipulation. It isn't a perfect system, but we do what we can to keep it as fair as possible.

Vote manipulation is a very broad spectrum of behaviour. We're not trying to be assholes here, we're trying to stop cheating and keep things fair. If you post a link on reddit and some friends see it and vote on it, we don't care. If more consistent patterns show up, we're going to be more concerned. You all aren't stupid; if you're doing something that feels like manipulation, it probably is.

We have put a lot of work into the site to mitigate vote cheating wherever possible, both via automated and manual means. If we catch an account or set of accounts vote cheating on reddit, then there is a good chance we'll take some sort of action against those accounts (such as banning).

The reason I'm directly bringing this up on the big e-sports related subreddits is that the problem of vote cheating has started to become very commonplace here. It is damn near 'expected behaviour' in some folks eyes, so recent banning incidents have been met with arguments such as 'everyone does it!' - this is not an acceptable excuse.
So, to make things crystal clear: If you engage or collude in the manipulation of votes of your own or others submissions on reddit, do not be surprised when we ban you. If you are engaging in this behaviour today and think you are getting away with it, consider this your fair warning to stop immediately.

Also, if the vote manipulation is being performed by the employees of a specific site, and we are unable to stop it via normal means, we may ban the site from being submitted to reddit until the issue can be addressed. This is a fairly extreme course of action that we rarely have to invoke, but it is a measure that has become more commonplace for sites common on e-sports related subreddits.
The action of barring a site from being submitted to reddit can only be performed by employees of reddit, and not the moderators. The mods are a completely volunteer group with no view into the vote cheating mitigation system. If your site gets banned, complaining to or about the moderators will get you nowhere.

Thanks for reading. I'll be happy to answer what questions I can in the comments. I'm a pretty close follower of various e-sports things, so don't feel the need to do any laborious exposition.

**TL;DR:**
Vote cheating and manipulation of all types(as defined above) is becoming more prevalent in e-sports related subreddits. If you're doing this, stop now.

Правила могут изменяться; как с PSA-извещением, так и без него.**
 
*****
 
**Правила создания тем/торговли**
 
1. **Поведение:** Не создавайте темы/сообщения, которые унижают других пользователей или в общем вызывают неудобства. Агрессивные, неуместные, сексистские, расистские или иные сомнительные комментарии и сообщения будут удалены, а автор может быть забанен.
 
2. **Засирание.** Критика чужих сделок и/или написание ненужных ""комментариев к ценам"" приведет к недельному бану для оскорбившего пользователя. В вашей ответственности будет [написать модераторам](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdota2trade) спустя неделю с просьбой разбана. Захват тем также противоречит правилам, и может привести к бану.
 
3. **Продажа итемов за Paypal/Moneypak.** Разрешена. Экономика выглядит и ведет себя схоже с аналогичной в Team Fortress 2. Это значит, что будучи *всегда рискованным,* это относительно простой процесс. Всегда используйте [посредника, одобренного SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/list/M), или модератора этого раздела для безопасной продажи итема. Смотрите раздел заметок для дополнительной информации.
 
4. **Итемы Dota 2 в обмен на игры.** Это разрешено, но *только* касательно игр, подлежащих обмену в steam. Это значит : **никаких cd-ключей, игровых ключей, или каких-либо серийников**! Это правило также распространяется на всевозможные Humble Indie Bundles ( наборы, часть выручки от продажи которых перечисляется на благотворительность) поскольку мы считаем, что HIB не должен покупаться с намерением извлечения прибыли. Этот же принцип распространяется и на другие вещи, вроде подарочных карточек iTunes и.т.д.
 
5. **Одна** тема на пользователя раз в **восемь** часов. Пожалуйста, не превышайте этот лимит. Вы **не можете** удалять ваши старые темы с целью обхода данного правила.

6. **Форматирование сообщений.** Пожалуйста, используйте следующий формат для создания сделок в данном сабреддите. ( Примечание: используйте **прописные буквы!**):
 
&gt;**[H] Дурацкая шапка для Bloodseeker'а [W] Дурацкая шапка для Pudge'а**
 
В добавок, в случае выпуска внутриигровой валюты ( схожей с металлом из Team Fortress 2) установка цен для вещей, которые вы продаете, будет обязательной. До тех пор, однако, вы можете использовать ""[W] Offers( выслушаю предложения)."" Этот схожий с аукционом формат запрещен в /tf2trade, по причине наличия ""валютной"" системы, которая пока еще отсутствует в Dota 2.
 
*Обновление: Темы с аукционами должны содержать резервную цену и время окончания. Темы, которые не содержат этих условий, будут удалены. В добавок, мы можем и будем банить аукционистов, которые не производят сделку по наивысшей ставке ( превосходящей резервную) по окончании аукциона.
 
**Другие теги.** Вы также можете создавать сообщения, используя следующие теги:
 
* [PC] -- означает проверку цены
 
* [Q] -- означает вопрос
 
* [Store] -- означает, что вы продаете более пяти итемов сразу
 
* [Raffle] -- означает, что вы проводите бесплатный розыгрыш (разрешен только такой вид лотерей)
 
* [PSA] -- означает, что у вас есть важная или полезная информация для сообщества (например: ""[PSA] В Dota 2 стало больше шапок для героев"")
 
* [Free] -- означает, что вы отдаете что-либо безвозмездно
 
* [SCAMMER] -- этот тег может быть использован ТОЛЬКО с целью сообщения о мошеннике, найденном в данном сабреддите. Пожалуйста, не создавайте темы с тегом [SCAMMER], если вы не можете связать steam аккаунт мошенника с аккаунтом на реддите. Пожалуйста, включите как можно больше деталей, как если бы вы отправляли жалобу на мошенника в SteamRep.
 
* [Idea] -- этот тег допустим **ТОЛЬКО** если вы предварительно согласовали идею с модераторами. Пожалуйста, напишите нам перед созданием подобных тем.
 
* [Auction] -- этот тег применим только в случае, если вы продаете итемы путем аукциона. Вы обязаны указать **резервную цену** и **время окончания**. Если вы не примите ставку, превосходящюю резервную по окончании аукциона, вы будете перманентно забанены в данном сообществе.

*****
 
**Заметки**
 
* Поднимайте темы с хорошими ценами / красивым оформлением, а не потому что вас попросили.(исключение в случае PSA, созданных модераторами)
 
* Не выпрашивайте голоса. Такие темы будут удалены.
 
* Используйте один тег для тем. Не создавайте комбо-посты.
 
* Избегание бана и использование альтернативных аккаунтов с целью обхода "" правила 8 часов"" приведет к суровому бану.

It seems that the time has come to explain why it is we have to manually approve so many posts.

**The short version is that our subreddit has a huge number of submissions that share similar qualities, so reddit's spam filter is very aggressively eating legitimate posts.**

Here's what you need to do if your post has not been automatically approved to the /new queue:

1. Review your post to make sure it adheres to the posting rules for this community. That means check your bracketed tags ([H]/[W]/[Store]/etc.), make sure you're not posting more than once in 12 hours, and so on. Please [read the rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/) if you're not sure.

2. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) and ask for approval. Link to your post in the message so we don't have to hunt it down. We will do a once-over to make sure it's good for approval, and if it isn't, we will tell you why.

3. Check [/new/](http://reddit.com/r/dota2trade/new) for your post.

4. **This is very important!** If the problem continues to happen, **message us again from the *same thread* if possible and ask to be an approved submitter!** We will check your post history to make sure you're following the rules properly, but approved submitters automatically make it to the /new/ queue. We will only do this if you follow these steps.

With his permission, I will likely break them down into keys and then some sets or something to spread the love a little more.

So this is where you come in, dear users. I want to make this a huge, awesome raffle. Those of you who are able, I am asking for donations of any kind! Even just a common or two. We can really make a lot of people happy here. Donations will be collected until Tuesday of next week, whereupon we will hold the raffle. More details as we get closer.

Please leave a message here with what you would like to donate, and I will either personally collect it or another mod will add you. **Note: please make sure you have been added by a real mod by checking the user's Steam profile versus the mod's. We hereby release responsibility if you mistakenly ""donate"" to a fake mod.**

I've avoided doing this as long as possible because I wanted each and every one of you to get to know me and the other mods personally. However, we are rapidly exploding in userbase, and that means a huge number of posts that are getting in the spam filter and many that need removed from the /new/ queue.

So... introducing /u/AutoModerator!

This bot is designed to automatically perform many tasks that the moderators had to do manually.

Here's what you need to know about it:

* AutoMod automatically pulls properly formatted posts out of the spam filter, so you no longer need to worry about that. If your post remains in the spam filter, it will tell you why.

* AutoMod removes posts that are not formatted properly and leaves a note as to why.

* AutoMod cannot ban users, but alerts the moderators whenever posts receive reports (so please use the report button!). Moderators will then investigate the post in question.

* AutoMod is a bot. Don't reply to its messages, because there's nobody there to respond. Message the mods if you have any questions.

*****

I hope this is a step in the right direction for us! It was just too much work for the mod team to keep everything in its proper place.

/r/dota2trade has grown so much so quickly, that we're already over half the total userbase of /r/tf2trade, which has existed for nearly two years, and we have more than double the concurrent users! This is amazing, and I couldn't be happier with the kind of growth and community we are cultivating.

Please continue to be shining examples of traders in the greater Steam trading community!

*Few notes about hero items:*

- Each hero has a base model in here as a reference point.
- Items marked with [**] are currently only obtainable through an end-game drop.
- Items marked with [@] are Immortals that were rewarded for reaching the 6th Compendium Stretch Goal.
- Items that come with a Seasonal Tag (Diretide, The International 2, Frostivus, Polycount) also come in non tagged versions.
- Items that are only available from the Valve Store will have a 'Digital Unlock' code sent with the product.  These items will also now have a Genuine Tag, which will give them a Green Border.
- Tournament items will have a Purple Border (Not to be confused with an unusual item) and a Match ID/Replay attached to it.  These can range from hero items of any rarity, couriers and wards.  Please note that if the tournament item is from a tournament that you do not own a ticket to, you will not be able to view the replay at all.
- Favored items will have a Yellow Border in your backpack.
- Items that were granted at The International 3 stations (Workshop, Voice Actor and Secret Shop) will have red text below the description of the item. This is also the same for Autographed items, however you can only have 1 autograph per item.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14d85g/h_dragonclaw_hook_w_6_keys/

____
People posting low offers for HOOK in an attempt to devalue its price. Let's put aside arguments for whether or not this is what Hook deserves to be priced at for a second.

Because these people do not have a flair, link their profile, and very frequently never even come back after the initial posting, it is impossible to determine the legitimacy of the trade.

While I suppose most users know enough to be skeptical of this kind of hustling attempt, others may be intimidated into selling their item at sub-market prices. (Just imagine it. You're a brand new trader who came here to sell your items without adequate knowledge of the market. You see all these threads of your item going for 6 keys. What do you do?)

You may want to say that Hook isn't even worth that much or should be at that price. OK. The hook is just an example. This technique can really be used on any existing item to create the illusion that price is dropping in order to pick up some sales at unfair prices.

So I am asking if it's possible to make it a rule to REQUIRE any thread submitter to either use flair or link their profile in the post in order to prevent some of these problems. (Maybe people posting questions / PSAs / etc can be exempt from this)

*Few notes about strange items:*

- The default modifier for 99% of strange items from chests is ""Kills"" There are a couple of exceptions to this and they will be noted on their cards.

- Maximum Strange Modifiers per item is 4.

- Stats are only recorded in Matchmaking games.

- If you trade an item with stats already recorded on it, they will be reset.

**Instructions**

1. Click the ""edit"" button on the sidebar, under the checkbox saying ""Show my flair on this reddit.""

2. In the text input field, paste your Steamcommunity profile URL. It will look like 

&gt;http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975564454

Do **not** use your custom URL, which looks like this:

&gt;http://steamcommunity.com/id/magnataur

The reason for this being that if you change your custom URL but forget to edit it here, the link will become inactive. However, the /profiles link will always work.

*****

If you don't know how to find your profile URL, follow these instructions:

1. Open Steam

2. Click the ""Steam"" button in the top-left to bring up the settings menu

3. Click the ""Interface"" tab, then check ""Display Steam URL address bar when available""

4. Copy the URL from the now present URL bar and paste into the flair input field mentioned above. If it is still an /id/xxxx link, then you need to view the following step.

5. Go to SteamRep.com and paste into the search bar your Steamcommunity /id/ link. Hit enter and go to the page it brings up. Under the ""Profile Indentifiers"" section, you will see ""steam64ID: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/#####."" Copy it and paste into your user flair input field.

1. Report the phishing url here (**Make sure you note it is a phishing url and remove the hyperlink**)

2. Take screen shots of the instance where the phishing link is being spread (If you know of alts where items are being funneled to report them as well with evidence)

3. Where to report phishers: (remember to report both the phishing bot and **the person who receives the items**) http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/, http://dota2traders.com/forums/report-a-scammer.21/

This should streamline the reporting process and hopefully help new traders/traders returning to the market not get hacked.

**General tips to recognize phishing:**

* Always check for Valve Corporation Certification. [Looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/2UlHyUQ.png)

* Bookmark [1] http://steamcommunity.com/ . Whenever you see that you have to login, just access steam community main page and login there, then refresh the page that asked you for credentials, if the credentials are not showing, then it is not an official site. You cant go wrong with this one.

* Someone says ""I'm interested in your deal, add me at staemcommunity.com/IAMAGIGANTICCUNT"" Or some other general term of accepting a deal. Also beware of people saying ""Add my friend here""

* Someone says ""Agree with your offer. Add me here.""  I cannot stress this enough, general terms of acceptance are BS and spammed by bots to many different threads (especially in lounge and outpost).

* Someone says ""Want free items download this program here at: ghost.definitelynotwalware.ru"" Spoiler: *It's actually malware.*

* Giveaways or raffles that require you to login to Steam

* Links that take you to a login page even though you are already signed into steam on your browser.


Thanks everyone and safe browsing. I will be adding some SSs tonight when I get home.

I wrote [this guide](http://redd.it/luc4d) for [/r/TF2Trade](http://tf2trade.com) many months ago, but the principles outlined therein apply directly to this market because of how Steam trade works now.

Some tips:

1. Check the profile of the buyer on SteamRep.com. Just paste the URL of the buyer into the search field, and it will bring up a page displaying whether that person has been outed as a scammer or not. Of course, if someone is using a brand-new Steam account, then they will likely not have a history, so be aware of that. I personally do not sell to accounts with little or no playtime on any games, since that's an easy way to spot a scammer.

2. Use a middleman or admin from here, /r/tf2trade, or SteamRep.com's middleman list. If you are being offered middleman services by someone with no rep thread (found on SourceOp.com), then it is a scam.

3. Verify that you're dealing with the real middleman and not an imposter. Cross-reference the Steam profile URL of the selected middleman with the one you are chatting with to ensure safety.

4. You cannot prevent Paypal scams. If the buyer wants to charge back, no amount of notes or gift payments will change that. You must accept this as a reality when buying or selling. However, finding buyers with reputation to suggest that they're trustworthy is easy. Usually, someone with more than a page of rep on their SourceOP rep thread, dating further back than just a week or two, is safe to sell to. **This is not a guarantee!**

5. Moneypak is the safest way to deal with Paypal. Please refer to the guide for more information on that.

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.
Our records show that you received a number of items/gifts that were stolen from hijacked Steam accounts. We have removed all of these items/gifts from your account.
Please refrain from accepting stolen items/gifts or the account may be permanently banned from Steam Trades.
If you have any further questions, please let us know - we will be happy to assist you. 8 Message by you on Sun, 10th Mar 2013 9:37 am Hello. First of all, thank you for removing my ban. I have paid for this with a very rare Drodo courier that i exchanged earlier this month. And now i have neither the Drodo courier, nor the keys. I don't know how much exactly, but between 120 and 140 keys are missing. i would like to receive my keys back, or the courier back. I got the keys from http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex and the Drodo is in him as you can check in his inventory and my trade history. I couldn't have known that these keys are stolen or whatever and you know this. All i want is to get what is rightfully mine. I thought i got limited because of my recent paypal purchase for a few items (not keys) but it's for this. I would like you to replace my deleted keys with ones that are not stolen or return my Drodo. I don't want more, i don't want less - just what is rightfully mine. Thank you. 9 Message by you on Sun, 10th Mar 2013 10:01 am i mean if you want to rollback the changes, i'm the end receiver, not the guy who stole the keys or neither the guy who the guy that stole the keys and sold to... i'm a distand receiver.... the correct thing to do here is to rollback the trade and i should have my drodo courier back.... but i will accept if you restore me the number of deleted keys...any of the 2 options is okay for me, again i don't want much - i just want what is rightfully mine and i have the right to defend. No user could ever know if the items he receives are stolen, plus it was a fair trade, it wasn't some lowball/highball trade that can raise the concern...i have the guy we traded in friends list still, he knows what's going on and he admitted to buying cheap keys for paypal money. This is his problem, but apparently it has become my problem because he practically got rid of the problematic (stolen) keys, by giving them to me, and now he's got a clear item (the drodo) that was mine. So again, i'm asking you for either way - either rollback the trade and give me back my drodo courier and speak with him about the stolen keys, since i have nothing to do with them, or restore me the deleted keys. I don't know how much exactly are missing, but anywhere between 120 and 140 if i'm correct. 10 Message by you on Mon, 11th Mar 2013 4:31 am Greetings. Recently i submitted ticket 5917-YIAB-6808 which was for my account getting limited activity, because of apparently me receiving some stolen/hijacked items. After further review, your team did the right thing by removing that limitation, since i had done nothing wrong. I just traded my drodo courier for keys, which is a fair deal. I couldn't have known that the keys were stolen/hijacked because it was not a ""fishy"" deal, that may've rose some concern - it was a fair trade. Be that as it may, the user that i sold the drodo courier to (and still has it) is http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex . He admitted buying keys outside of the valve trading system, paying for them in paypal at a very low price ($1.5-$1.6 a key from what i understood from his post on reddit). My trade is within the valve system, it didn't use any 3rd party sites like paypal, yet i was the one to suffer. He wasn't banned, he still has the courier and stated that he won't return the courier. Now i don't want him banned, but he is the one in breach of the steam agreement - not me. Thanks for removing the limitation, but again, i have done nothing wrong by you or any trader. I don't want more, i just want what's rightfully mine. I want the keys that were deleted from me (they were anywhere between 120 and 140, i didn't count) back... i'm in my right to request so, i didn't breach ANY of your rules in my 6 years as a steam user. I don't want the seller banned, but it's his fault for accepting these keys and i certainly don't appreciate being the receiver of the penalties. The other way, and even more convinient way for me would be if the trade is rollbacked and i get the courier back... And i won't sell it unless the trader is very reputable, so I may know what i'm getting with. But again, i will not stop fighting for what 's rightfully mine and for what i've paid for...check my trade history, or moreso check my in-game purchase history..i'm a very active buyer and again, i would never ask for more or less.. just what i deserve and what's mine. I want either the keys restored or the trade with the Drodo courier rollbacked so i have the Drodo again in the first place. I'm not the problem for you here, it's the trader that sold the keys to http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex and Syndicatex himself, so you should seek responsibility from them, not from me. I know you won't disappoint me, you haven't in 6 years, i doubt you'll start now. Thank you for your time and cooperation. 11 Message by you on Mon, 11th Mar 2013 5:13 am I just got even more information on the case. First of all, the seller http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061655545 's steamrep profile is http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198061655545 and you can clearly see he has 7 proven to be scammer friends. Now i talked with him a few minutes ago and he was acting like he doesn't know me, saying things like somebody has used his account , somebody has made posts and talked to me instead of him... this is not the case as i have proof of it all and you can double check it's only him that's logged with this account. Now here is all the proof i could gather: 1. On the day when i told him i got banned for the keys and keys were deleted he made a post on reddit http://i.imgur.com/6SOma2w.jpg 2. He admitted buying keys for $$$ outside the valve trading system, but today he says he traded them for a smeevil.

Here's a log of the entire conversation today we had on steam ( http://www.twitlonger.com/show/l9c08v ) and 2 screenshots of the most important parts, when he lies and acts like he has never knew me and that someone has impersonated him...while it was this account and none other. http://i.imgur.com/q1hQJrt.jpg and http://i.imgur.com/bha0ke4.jpg 5.

Bottom line is this - he laundered his stolen keys for my drodo and i paid the price for it. My ban got lifted when i contacted you, but now i don't have the keys and he still has the drodo courier. I want either the keys restored or my drodo courier back, either way works for me. Also i'd like to point out that he just broke a lot of your rules by lying on a few occasions and attempting 2 scams (maybe 3 if he really bought the keys $$ or didn't steal them himself). I would like you to look further into his activity and take appropriate action against him as well as return what's rightfully mine - either the keys, restored or trade rollbacked so i have the drodo courier back. 12 Message by you on Mon, 11th Mar 2013 5:13 am I just got even more information on the case. First of all, the seller http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061655545 's steamrep profile is http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561198061655545 and you can clearly see he has 7 proven to be scammer friends. Now i talked with him a few minutes ago and he was acting like he doesn't know me, saying things like somebody has used his account , somebody has made posts and talked to me instead of him... this is not the case as i have proof of it all and you can double check it's only him that's logged with this account. Now here is all the proof i could gather: 1. On the day when i told him i got banned for the keys and keys were deleted he made a post on reddit http://i.imgur.com/6SOma2w.jpg 2. He admitted buying keys for $$$ outside the valve trading system, but today he says he traded them for a smeevil. Which is impossible, because smeevil is a lot more valuable than the number of keys he gave me. http://i.imgur.com/M6aUisM.jpg 3.

Unfortunately, we will be unable to assist you further with this issue.
Thank you for contacting Steam Support. 14 Message by you on Tue, 12th Mar 2013 4:30 am I am in my rights to want what is rightfully mine. I am the victim of laundering of stolen keys and a seller admitting facts and then lying about them. He is the one that should be punished and paying the price, not me. I did the trade within the steam trading system, he paid for them outside. You should be on my side, considering your own steam rules, which i didn't breach, he did, on a number of topics. I would like you to review all the information i gave you and reconsider. I don't want more, i don't want less - i just want what belongs to me and is rightfully mine. 15 Message by you on Tue, 12th Mar 2013 4:34 am Hello. With all due respect, i disagree with you leaving me without the keys... I paid with the keys with a very rare Drodo courier that i exchanged earlier this month. And now i have neither the Drodo courier, nor the keys. I don't know how much exactly, but between 120 and 140 keys are missing. i would like to receive my keys back, or the courier back. I got the keys from http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex and the Drodo is in him as you can check in his inventory and my trade history. I couldn't have known that these keys are stolen or whatever and you know this. All i want is to get what is rightfully mine. I thought i got limited because of my recent paypal purchase for a few items (not keys) but it's for this. I would like you to replace my deleted keys with ones that are not stolen or return my Drodo. I don't want more, i don't want less - just what is rightfully mine.
i mean if you want to rollback the changes, i'm the end receiver, not the guy who stole the keys or neither the guy who the guy that stole the keys and sold to... i'm a distand receiver.... the correct thing to do here is to rollback the trade and i should have my drodo courier back.... but i will accept if you restore me the number of deleted keys...any of the 2 options is okay for me, again i don't want much - i just want what is rightfully mine and i have the right to defend. No user could ever know if the items he receives are stolen, plus it was a fair trade, it wasn't some lowball/highball trade that can raise the concern...i have the guy we traded in friends list still, he knows what's going on and he admitted to buying cheap keys for paypal money. This is his problem, but apparently it has become my problem because he practically got rid of the problematic (stolen) keys, by giving them to me, and now he's got a clear item (the drodo) that was mine. So again, i'm asking you for either way - either rollback the trade and give me back my drodo courier and speak with him about the stolen keys, since i have nothing to do with them, or restore me the deleted keys. I don't know how much exactly are missing, but anywhere between 120 and 140 if i'm correct.
Recently i submitted ticket 5917-YIAB-6808 which was for my account getting limited activity, because of apparently me receiving some stolen/hijacked items. After further review, your team did the right thing by removing that limitation, since i had done nothing wrong. I just traded my drodo courier for keys, which is a fair deal. I couldn't have known that the keys were stolen/hijacked because it was not a ""fishy"" deal, that may've rose some concern - it was a fair trade. Be that as it may, the user that i sold the drodo courier to (and still has it) is http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex . He admitted buying keys outside of the valve trading system, paying for them in paypal at a very low price ($1.5-$1.6 a key from what i understood from his post on reddit). My trade is within the valve system, it didn't use any 3rd party sites like paypal, yet i was the one to suffer. He wasn't banned, he still has the courier and stated that he won't return the courier. Now i don't want him banned, but he is the one in breach of the steam agreement - not me. Thanks for removing the limitation, but again, i have done nothing wrong by you or any trader. I don't want more, i just want what's rightfully mine. I want the keys that were deleted from me (they were anywhere between 120 and 140, i didn't count) back... i'm in my right to request so, i didn't breach ANY of your rules in my 6 years as a steam user. I don't want the seller banned, but it's his fault for accepting these keys and i certainly don't appreciate being the receiver of the penalties. The other way, and even more convinient way for me would be if the trade is rollbacked and i get the courier back... And i won't sell it unless the trader is very reputable, so I may know what i'm getting with. But again, i will not stop fighting for what 's rightfully mine and for what i've paid for...check my trade history, or moreso check my in-game purchase history..i'm a very active buyer and again, i would never ask for more or less.. just what i deserve and what's mine. I want either the keys restored or the trade with the Drodo courier rollbacked so i have the Drodo again in the first place. I'm not the problem for you here, it's the trader that sold the keys to http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syndicatex and Syndicatex himself, so you should seek responsibility from them, not from me.
I am in my rights to want what is rightfully mine. I am the victim of laundering of stolen keys and a seller admitting facts and then lying about them. He is the one that should be punished and paying the price, not me. I did the trade within the steam trading system, he paid for them outside.

I don't want more, i don't want less - i just want what belongs to me and is rightfully mine.
I know you won't disappoint me, you haven't in 6 years, i doubt you'll start now. Thank you for your time and cooperation. 16 Message by you on Tue, 12th Mar 2013 4:41 am Please review all the information and i beg you to reconsider....for the upteenth time, i am the victim here and it's not my fault..the trade was fair, i traded I am in my rights to want what i paid for and what is rightfully mine and you have absolutely no right and there is no such clause in the steam user or trading agreement to take it away from me. Was i part of a trade ""net"" that is not under the protection of the steam agreeement? It would appear so, but it's not my fault, i am the victimm. I want either my keys back or the trade rollbacked. Why was the entire trade removed (keys and clinkz mask) but the drodo courier is still in the seller that got me in this position in the first place? He lied on a number of occasions, like i pointed out with PROOF and gets away freely with it? Now he has the courier and is free, while should be banned from trading, because of those stolen keys.... while i was banned for a whole 3 days and the goods were removed....if you don't wish to restore the keys, it's alright by me. But at least rollback the trade and give me the drodo courier back. Put yourself in my position, before you respond with ""i'm sorry we can't assist you more on this matter"" You would want the same i want. Thanks for reconsideration and your time! 17 Message by Support Tech Timothy on Wed, 13th Mar 2013 12:32 pm Hello [hidden],

Thank you for contacting Steam Support. 18 Message by you on Wed, 13th Mar 2013 2:32 pm It is not fair. I have paid for everything i have and have traded everything i have. In the honest way, unlike the seller that has gone intact. I want my keys back or the trade rollbacked so i get my drodo courier back or i will go public with this issue and will let people know what has happened here. I don't want you, dear Timothy, to support me and give me an empty answer like ""we will be unable to assist you"" as i want this entire conversation forwarded to the right department, to the right people so they know what's going on in their system.

There is some really tricky scammer stealing gold roshans, if you are active trader check your middleman many times that it is really the real middleman.

Few gold roshans have been scammed already the same way.
If you are active trader he might have traded something with you and asked maybe to leave you on friendlist or maybe he have offered something for roshan and stay in your friendlist that way.

Then he someday adds you as ""buyer"" and gives you nice offer and asks who is gonna be middleman etc. And then if you have that middleman already on your friendlist he might use that account he friendlisted on you earlier he changes name, avatar etc.

Ofcourse this doesnt work (I guess) if you are good friend with that middleman and you know him if he speaks other language than english.

Like if you have Wuvs (dota2traders.com admin) in your friendlist already, you dont really talk with him never but you know you added real Wuvs when you added him.
But scammer changes everything on his 2nd account same as Wuvs so you think its Wuvs because you know it was him when you added him.

1. **Conduct:** Do not make posts or comments that put other users down or generally stir up trouble. Offensive, inappropriate, sexist, racist, or otherwise unsavory comments and posts will be removed, and the poster may be subject to a ban.

2. **Shitposting.** Putting down other people's trades and/or offering unsolicited ""price commentary"" will result in a week ban for the offending user. It will be your responsibility to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdota2trade) after one week to request an unban. Thread hijacking is also against the rules and may result in a ban. Thread hijacking is when you attempt to steal business from a user's post.

Additionally, insulting other users for pricing items the way they have is absolutely unacceptable. This is childish behavior. Let's hope you're all older than children.

3. **Selling items for Paypal/Moneypak.** Permitted. The economy looks and behaves much like the Team Fortress 2 trading scene. This means that, while *always risky,* it is a relatively simple process. Always use a [SteamRep-approved middleman](http://steamrep.com/list/M) or moderator of this subreddit to sell an item safely. Refer to the notes section for more information.

4. **Dota 2 items for games.** This will be allowed here, but *only* Steam tradable games will be permitted. This means **no CD-keys, game codes, or serials whatsoever**! This rule also applies to any and all Humble Indie Bundles, as we believe the HIB should not be purchased with the intent to profit. The same principle applies to other things like iTunes gift cards and so on.

5. **One** thread per user per **eight** hours. Please do not exceed this limit. You **may not** delete your old threads to bypass this rule. Moderators are exempt from this rule, but may not use it to post multiple trade threads, i.e., one or two PSAs and a personal thread.

6. **Post formatting.** Please use the following format to post trades here (Note: use **capital letters!**):

&gt;**[H] Silly hat for Bloodseeker [W] Silly hat for Pudge** 

Pleas note that the AutoModerator bot will remove your post if you swap the order of [H]/[W].

Additionally, if ever an in-game currency is released comparable to the refined metal system in TF2, setting prices for items you are selling will be mandatory and enforced strictly. Until we see that, however, you may use ""[W] Offers."" This ""auction-style"" post format is disallowed in /tf2trade because of the availability of a ""currency"" system, which is not yet present in Dota 2.

*Update:* Auction threads must contain a **reserve price** and an **end time**. Threads which do not contain these features will be removed. Additionally, we can and will place a ban on auctioneers who do not honor a bid past the reserve at the end time. SECOND UPDATE: Users who attempt to circumvent the [Auction] tag by posting [H]/[W] threads with an END TIME in the title will be temporarily banned. You **may not** post [H]/[W] threads with time limits. These must be [Auction]s.

**Other post tags.** You may also make other posts using the following tags:

* [PC] -- indicating a price check

* [Q] -- indicating a question

* [Store] -- indicating that you are selling more than five items at once

* [Raffle] -- indicating that you are hosting a **free** raffle (only these will be allowed)

* [PSA] -- indicating you have important or relevant information for the community (example: ""[PSA] Dota 2 hats may now be worn by more heroes"")

* [Free] -- indicating you are giving items away

* [SCAMMER] -- this tag may ONLY be used to report a scammer found here on the subreddit. Please do not post [SCAMMER] threads if you cannot tie their Steam account to a reddit account. Please include the level of detail you would in a scammer report on SteamRep

* [Idea] -- this tag is **ONLY** acceptable if you run the idea by the mods first. Please message us before posting.

* [Auction] -- this tag is only used to present an auction for the items you are selling. You must include a **reserve price** and an **end time**. If you do not honor a bid meeting the reserve price at the end time, you will be permanently banned from this community.


*****

**Notes**

* Upvote based on prices and good post formatting, not because you've been asked to (except in the case of PSAs made by the mods)

* Do not beg for upvotes. Those threads will be removed.

* Use one tag per post. No combo posts.

* Ban evasion and use of alts to bypass the 8-hour posting rule will result in severe bans.

* Scammers will be reported to [/r/badkarma](http://reddit.com/r/badkarma) as well as [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). We do not tolerate any of that behavior.

* Account trading of **any kind** is strictly forbidden. It violates the EULA for just about everything, and is generally very unsafe.

* Item prices are *never* set in stone. Tools like spreadsheets or price check sites are useful for gaining a ballpark estimate of an item's value, but the real determinant is the market. Finding other examples of your item on the market and what those people are charging is the only way to get an accurate valuation.

* If trading an item for Paypal/Moneypak, it is **highly suggested** that you use a middleman from [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/list/M). A middleman greatly reduces the risk of getting scammed, but the inherent risks of selling an item for cash are still there, meaning using a middleman does not give you immunity to a chargeback scam. Sell at your own risk! Additionally, **check the profile of the buyer on SteamRep to see if that person is a known scammer!** If so, cancel the sale and walk away.",,False,,t5_2t22d,1375126870.0,,trusted,True,t3_tcphp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/,moderator

These keys usually disappear on the account after a few hours and a few suspicious key resellers already have appeared on various chats asking for $1.7 paypal. These traders have a private profile, inventory and backpack. Make sure the seller you are buying from is legit. This is important to you because if you buy these keys, you might get tangled up in a steam trade ban for receiving fraudulent keys.

I will update the list with any new urls as they are reported. What we do is simple:

1. Report the phishing url here (**Make sure you note it is a phishing url and remove the hyperlink**)

2. Take screen shots of the instance where the phishing link is being spread (If you know of alts where items are being funneled to report them as well with evidence)

3. Where to report phishers: (remember to report both the phishing bot and **the person who receives the items**) http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/, http://dota2traders.com/forums/report-a-scammer.21/

This should streamline the reporting process and hopefully help new traders/traders returning to the market not get hacked.

General tips to recognize phishing:

* Always check for Valve Corporation Certification. [Looks like this.](http://i.imgur.com/2UlHyUQ.png)

* Bookmark [1] http://steamcommunity.com/ . Whenever you see that you have to login, just access steam community main page and login there, then refresh the page that asked you for credentials, if the credentials are not showing, then it is not an official site. You cant go wrong with this one.

* Someone says ""I'm interested in your deal, add me at staemcommunity.com/IAMAGIGANTICCUNT"" Or some other general term of accepting a deal. Also beware of people saying ""Add my friend here""

* Someone says ""Agree with your offer. Add me here.""  I cannot stress this enough, general terms of acceptance are BS and spammed by bots to many different threads (especially in lounge and outpost).

* Someone says ""Want free items download this program here at: ghost.definitelynotwalware.ru"" Spoiler: *It's actually malware.*

* Giveaways or raffles that require you to login to Steam

* Links that take you to a login page even though you are already signed into steam on your browser.

Even though this is my second recent post I believe this is very important.

For those who have not seen it, when you trade someone via steam a message appears at the top of the trade window informing you that Steam Guard will have to be enabled on your account for __15 days starting on December 12th__ for you to be able to trade anyone. This means __the last day you can enable Steam Guard and not experience any trading blocks is November 27th__.

Besides the trading window message there has been no official post by valve on this, but there is a steam forum post [here](http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3009296) discussing the new requirement. I believe they have brought this into effect to minimize scams and alt account quick trading to avoid trade bans, hopefully this will mean a safer trading community for everyone.

__To Enable Steam Guard__

1. Login to the Steam Client
2. Open up the main steam window (this should appear upon logging in)
3. Go to the top left hand corner and select 'Steam'
4. From the drop down box hit 'Settings'
5. A new window should appear and have a option called 'Manage Steam Guard Account Security', click that.
6. Another window should open that has a button to enable steam guard

The moderation group have decided that these are not strictly PSAs, and as such shouldn't be under that title. However, we also appreciate the gesture as, after all, these announcements are just trying to protect other traders. As such, we've decided to hold a vote whether it is necessary to have a tag [Scammer Alert] whenever such events pop up. Please leave comments regarding whether you believe this is necessary as it is your opinions that create and improve this community.


We also believe that Dota traders perhaps have less experience at dealing with these scammers. One of the key ways you deal with them is through Steam Rep. You can access Steam Rep here: http://steamrep.com/.

Steam Rep is a method of checking someone's online reputation for trading of Steam games and Steam items. If you type enter their community profile in the search bar, it should show their status. Users can be marked with no status, special status (such as being a moderator of a reliable trading group), caution or scammer. No status will apply to the general public, while cautions and scammer tags are applicable to those who have committed either a minor offence or offence in the past. It is important to always search someone's reputation before doing a trade, as a search revealing a scammer, or a cautioned player may save you from losing out on a large transaction. This however, is not fool proof and many new scammers are entered into the database every day.

It is necessary to report scammers to build up this database and as such, you can file reports to get scammers marked here: http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/. Remember to follow the template provided. By doing this, you are potentially saving other traders from being scammed.",,False,,t5_2t22d,False,,trusted,True,t3_z6sq8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/z6sq8/psa_regarding_scammers_and_a_community_vote/,moderator

So I'll do a generalized version.
 
 

Be very careful when trading Smeevils, and always check the side panel for someone trying to switch a fully unlocked Smeevil for a fully locked one. This is how it usually works:
 
* He adds Smeevil to trade
 
* You add your item(s)
 
* While you are adding your items he switches the Smeevil for another one which doesnt have the unlocks you want, hoping you wont notice
 
 
Hope this helps others not to get scammed as I almost was, since there seems to be a lot of those going around, if the posts here are anything to judge from. 
 
 
Also, just because his SteamRep doesn't show any reports and/or his profile has 10 pages of ""+rep, good trader"" doesn't mean he won't try something (the scammer who tried to do it to me has exactly that). His account might have been hacked or he just got greedy.

1. You go to bet on Dota2lounge.com  
2. Add &amp; wait for your bot  
3. The scammer has the bot page opened up and checks who the bot adds next. As soon as the person is added on the list, the scammer adds that person under the same name as the D2L bot.  

How to detect the scammer(s):  

1. Bots often reply VERY QUICKLY with a ""Yo!""  
2. Bots don't take forever to type (re-iterating point 1)  
3. Bots give you the same code as the D2L protection code provided on the bottom right corner of the page just before adding the bot.   
4. Bot ID (steam ID) is given by the same bottom right corner. Make sure you double check.

As seen here:  
[Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/1DdBVWxh.png) - you can see the scammer tries to type something after my initial ""hi"" and deletes me from friends after I catch him.

A note about Old Blue: also known as Light Blue, it is a legacy/discontinued color that was available for a very short period after the June 25 color patch. While not a unique color, Old Blue couriers are extremely rare, and this particular combination (i.e. EF + Morok + 50, 166, 207) is likely unique. I have personally only seen: 1x EF morok, 1x RE morok, 1x LG morok, 1x EF badger. If anyone knows of more I would be glad to hear of them, I like to know a bit about the history of my couriers. =)

**PAYPAL ACCOUNT: REFUNDED**       
**STEAM ACCOUNT: REINSTATED** 

A couple weeks ago someone posted on here selling keys for $1.9 each. he said him and his buddy were selling keys but he had to wait for his friend to get home, also that if i bought them all i could get them for $1.8.  I didn't think much of it and it wasn't that suspicious. Hours later i bought 160 keys for $288 paypal and that was that. He then told me that his ""teammates"" had some more keys if i wanted to buy them for the same price. 

The next day he messages me and asks if i want some more keys. I said yes because at that time aristar was still selling keys for $2.10 or something like that and i felt it was too good to pass up. i send him the money and i add his ""teammates"" accounts. This is where i started to get suspicious. All of the accounts had the same last name in them. Anyways after the tranaction i look at all the accounts on dota 2 that i recently traded with. Not one of them has even played a game. This is where i felt like it was a chargeback scam or something like that and i googled it and talked to a mod here.
A google search turned up a TF2 key scheme with russians, but i couldnt find anything with peoples accounts getting in trouble or anything with DOTA 2 scams so i messaged a mod on here and asked his advice. He told me not to chargeback unless anything happened and he didnt seem to concerned. 

Monday i log in and try to watch some tournament that was going on and it wouldnt let me purchase the ticket for $1. I thought it was glitched but i was on the Steam DOTA 2 Market and it then told me ""Purchasing has been disabled for you account."" I end up sending an e-mail to support wondering what was going on and waited until today to get a reply.

They sent me...    

""Hello (my real name),

Thank you for contacting Steam Support.

As of now nothing has changed in my account. I still cant trade or purchase or anything and i have a big red warning bar at the top of my steam.     

I need to chargeback the scammer who i sent the paypal to. i 
need to know how/if i can do that. I sent the money as a gift about two weeks ago. If someone can pm me the details on how to do it i would appreciate it. (i dont want the details on how to do it posted here for obv reasons)

I did lose my keys when I got it back but I figured that would happen. I just hope my account of this helps someone in the future who might have to deal with this.

I was a damned fool and trusted you, but you'll probably get away with it. I guess all I can really do is learn my lesson and hope for the off chance you have read this and give it some consideration.

Me getting scammed by you wasn't the first foolish thing I did this week, buying the courier in the first place was. I just got a surprise increase in bills lately because my dog just got diagnosed with intestinal cancer and probably won't live too much longer (can provide proof with vet papers if not believed). The pain pills are about $30 for two weeks worth. I'll always pay for them and will sacrifice my own food if I have to, but that courier reselling was going to make things a hell of a lot easier.

Anyway, the reason I probably got scammed is because I was so anxious to sell the damned thing as quickly as possible. I actually had an offer from someone for $85 dollars but it would be tomorrow, and I was just going to tell him ""sorry, sold for $96"". But I guess I'm just at a really horrible 96 dollar loss.

If you could find it in your heart to give the damned thing back, I would sincerely owe you one. If you don't want to, I understand that too. I don't believe in karma and I don't think there will be hell to pay or that your guilt will consume you or anything. You pretty much earned it, but I would sure as hell like it back, and would even offer you free items from my inventory for it.

If you have any questions, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) to request clarification.

*****

###General Site Rules

* Be courteous and respectful to others at all times. The conduct of every user affects the reputation of this site, so we expect the highest level of civility from those in our community.

* Avoid arguments with others: either resolve your differences in private conversation, or ask a moderator to mediate your dispute.

* All users must register their flair to post (instructions below). Each person may post with a single account: hiding one’s identity will not be tolerated except in extremely rare special cases.

*****

###Posting and Trading Rules

* Only one thread is allowed per user every 8 hours. The exception to this rule is if the user posts a [PSA] or [SCAMMER] thread that meets the requirements laid forth here. This rule may not be bypassed by deleting old threads.

* Do not provide unsolicited price commentary. This includes any of a wide range of comments about the pricing of OP's items when *not asked for.*

* Do not ask for upvotes (either in your thread or outside of reddit).

* Never hijack threads. If you are offering the same trade as someone else, start a new thread for your own use.

*Extended trading rules:*

* Accounts must be **older than 24 hours** in order to post.

* Trading items for real-world currencies is permitted. If using PayPal/MoneyPak, please follow [this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14a6wp/psa_how_to_safely_trade_dota_2steamtradable_items/) to ensure a safe transaction. More guides will be written in the near future for Western Union, Bitcoins and bank wires.

* No trades involving cd-keys, game codes, serials, or redeemable cards (including Steam Wallet, Amazon, iTunes, or other gift cards) will be permitted. This rule also applies to any and all Humble Bundles, as we believe they should not be purchased with the intent to profit.

* Account trading of any kind is strictly forbidden. Not only is it very unsafe, but it also violates the EULA/TOS of every major company.

* Dota 2 item price check sites have historically been inaccurate at best; it is advised that you do not use them. For accurate price checks, [search recent trades](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on) or ask another member.

* Upvote based on prices and good post formatting, not because you've been asked to (except in the case of PSAs made by the mods)

* Use one tag per post. No combo posts.

* Ban evasion and use of alts to bypass the 8-hour posting rule will result in severe bans.

* Scammers will be reported to [/r/badkarma](http://reddit.com/r/badkarma) as well as [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). We do not tolerate any of that behavior.


*Trade formatting rules:*

Any post whose title does not mirror one of the below tags will be automatically deleted by a bot. Please use only one tag per post.

* [H] items [W] items

* [Auction] all auctions must include a reserve price and an end time; anyone who does not honor the reserve at the conclusion of the auction will be permanently banned from this community. All trades with time limits and/or reserves must be posted as auctions.

* [PC] price check

* [Q] question

* [PSA] important or relevant information for the community (note: must have a proper and reliable source)

* [Store] selling 5 or more items at a time

* [Raffle] free-to-enter raffles only

* [Free] giveaway

* [Scammer] this tag may only be used to report scammers found on r/dota2trade (i.e. reddit and Steam accounts are known). Please include the level of detail you would normally use when reporting at SteamRep ([instructions here](http://forums.steamrep.com/threads/howto-report-a-scammer-look-at-acceptable-format-before-posting.51/)).

* [Idea] please message the mods for approval before posting an Idea thread.

*****

###Flair Registration

All users must register their flair in order to post on this subreddit.

1. Visit http://dota2.trade.redditgaming.com/start and click ""Allow.""

2. You will be redirected to the Steam web login page via the Steam WebAPI. If you are not already signed in to Steam, enter your login info. If you are already logged in, simply click ""Login.""

3. Confirm that SteamBot has sent you a message on Reddit informing you that you have been added as an approved submitter for this subreddit.

4. In some cases, there may be a delay before you are able to post. If you are still unable to 24 hours after registering, message the mods and we will investigate your case.

*Troubleshooting:*

* If you get the ""Yikes! Something has gone wrong!"" page, simply go back to http://dota2.trade.redditgaming.com/start and repeat the process from the beginning until it works.

* If you get a 500 internal server error page, you must wait short while and repeat the process from the beginning.

*[Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) if you:*

* successfully complete steps 1 and 2 but do not receive a message from SteamBot.

* receive the ""You already have flair"" error.

* experience any strange issues (e.g. being assigned someone else's flair).

* correctly registered your flair in the past, but wish to change it to a different account

I am unable to list unique legacy couriers for obvious reasons but would love to have them included.

This is going to take a while. :P Add me up if you can spare 5 minutes and have those couriers or want me to make a video for you. I don't need you to trade me the couriers, I can just record in a custom lobby game. :) http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerye

Middlemen can been found of steam-rep, dota2traders or reddit/dota2. When dealing with money, money always always goes first, seeing as these couple of days people have been getting scammed, it hurts hard when real traders that trade via paypal who aren't out there to scam is given a bad name by these acts making the sellers unsure. So if you want to keep your courier/money safe

1. Find yourself a middleman
2. Take Screenshots
3. Check his account for information its very subtle. (Time the account was made, the amount of hours spent on the game, his friends) If any of these is lower than normal ( its quite easy to see and tell) then don't trust it.
4. Ask for rep thread if applicable, Posting rep on walls do not count, they can easily be faked.

A few weeks ago, Valve issued a fix to stop black/grey/pink unusuals from being generated. To eliminate the problem colors they decided to only allow crates to generate 10 different RGB codes while also retrofitting all current couriers to the new RGB pool. A lot of people were pretty upset that their themed/carefully selected colors were changed completely, lowering some of the unusual values significantly. The next day Valve decided to revert the changes and issue a new fix for black/grey unusuals. People are still overvaluing couriers based on the assumption that crates are now only generating RGB combos within this 10 color pool, Skewing prices for otherwise low tier effects. 

It doesn't matter whether you think this is true or just a rumor; an official word on this matter helps everyone in the community. If you have a courier with a Legacy color and this rumor is confirmed to be true, you won't get sharked out of having what could potentially be a valuable/collectible item in the future. If it has been confirmed to be untrue, you won't feel like you have sit on a less valuable courier and wait for it to shoot up in value. Please show your support in this thread. Many of you are investing a lot of time/money into Dota 2 trading and less confusion = happier traders and a more stable virtual economy.

http://dota2lounge.com/trade?t=16461385


So after I added the 25 keys we accepted trade and it didn't go because he cancelled during the process and said he had lag. In the 2nd trade attempt, he thought I wouldn't check what courier it was and he put a light green Luminous Gaze one instead and tried to distract me with talk. He then said it was a mistake and re-added the EF one, I added the keys and he quickly changed it to the LG one again. He went offline after it failed.

But I will re-post it here for more awareness. 

It has come to my attention that now people are using trading forums to post their phishing sites behind a real steam profile. So practically its a fake ""Phishing Steam Site profile"" hidden underneath a Legit Steam Profile link using hyperlinks. 

So, how to really spot them? 

Do not click any link because how legit it looks, you have to take into consideration two things:

1. Is the user account posting the trade NEW to the site? If yes, then there's a problem coming here, since there's so many accounts getting banned daily, all the scammers are using new accounts. So if he suddenly want's to buy a few international couriers for paypal/keys or what not then there's something fishy here. You can easy spot this through the ""join date, or account creation date"" in many forums profiles. 

2. This will be the easiest one, but people still fall for it, the link looks legit, but is it really legit? There are ways to hide a url behind a text, this ""text"" can be displayed as a regular/legit url. This process is called, hyperlinking. 

So really, how to spot them?

Here is how: Before clicking a link, make sure to hover your mouse over to the link of the profile, and check that same link appears in your screen as the one you are re-directing, and this is an image of how it looks like: 

Tinypic: http://oi50.tinypic.com/70u9mo.jpg

Imageshack: http://img854.imageshack.us/img854/7016/phishingsites.png

Check the obvious title, that you are dealing with high end couriers, real money.
Check the creation date of the account posting, it's pretty recent date, this month, meaning it's new. This take's away the interest of finding a trustable trade with someone with a new account.
Pass your mouse over the profile link before clicking it, you can spot the difference's in the re-directing site box on the left bottom corner of your browser. 

Hope you guys have a nice read, and be careful when clicking a profile link. Remember not to get fooled by what you see in a text that looks like legit a link, but what will be next if you click it. 

tl;dr Hyperlinks fools your eyes.

I started this subreddit as an existing moderator of /r/tf2trade to give the burgeoning Dota 2 trading community a safe and healthy place to conduct trades. I planned on running this subreddit in much the same way that I do with my fellow moderators at /tf2trade. The number one thing that I have set out to do is keep this community as safe and enjoyable as possible, which has included monitoring threads for behavior like what we saw earlier.

The reason the thread was taken down was not because it was not informative, but because I felt there wasn't enough evidence in the original post to warrant such accusations as were made. Additionally, I felt that the thread was far beyond ""civil discussion,"" and had become a witch hunt. The unfortunate reality is that ""groupthink"" tends to be a popular method of thought on Reddit, even in such a niche community as ours. I do not support such witch hunts, and so I pulled the thread.

After speaking with the OP, I felt it was time to address the issue of market manipulation and spreadsheets.

*****

Let me just start by saying that it is in the [rules and guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/tcphp/official_rdota2trade_rules_and_guidelines/) that users should not use tools such as spreadsheets, price checking sites, and price guides as ""law"" when trading or selling items. What will ultimately determine the price of your item is demand and past trades. It is ultimately your responsibility to research your item's value before you trade it away, which brings me to my next point.

Sharking has been a major issue in the Steam tradables community as a whole. Sharking is taking advantage of another user's lack of market savvy to trick them into trading their valuable item for your much, much less valuable item. In TF2, unusual hats could be as valuable as $3000 (really), so it was not uncommon for extremely unsavory types to shark these items for next to nothing, convincing the victim that they were getting a good deal. The sharks would then re-sell for tons of profit. However, in the last six months or so, there was a major crackdown on this behavior, and many previously ""respected"" traders were outed for sharks, effectively ruining their reputation. Let it be known that I was a major contributor to the fight against sharks, as I still am within this community.

The thing about sharking is that it is not technically a scamming, at least by SteamRep's current definition of the term ""scam,"" but on /tf2trade and /dota2trade, it will get you immediately removed from the community with close to **zero chance of an unban**. We feel that this type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, and we do not want it ruining our community. Action has already been taken against users who have attempted this on the subreddit, so please report any instances to the mods and we will examine the case closely.

Now, the OP of the post earlier was warning the community of a group of users who planned to use their spreadsheet site to effectively control market forces to their gain. Manipulating the market in ways like this is unacceptable. This is why we have a strictly-enforced rule regarding unsolicited price commentary; the market should always flow naturally, not because User X says Item Y is worth Value Z. Once OP can provide sufficient evidence that implicates any users in this manner, action may be taken against those users. However, for the time being, we will continue to monitor the situation carefully.

I will allow the discussion of the issue in this PSA, but only if discussion remains civil and respectful. Comments will be moderated as need be.

I just got my account banned permanently for buying stolen keys. This is the second time i accidently bought stolen keys. This time im not exactly sure who they were from tho. I bought a bunch of keys recently when hooks became immortal. It seems like i am screwed with no options left. If anyone has any advice or can help at all it would be appreciated. Idk if i should chargeback all my recent key purchases or just bear the losses.

All you have to do is post in this thread or contact me to help us to take the ingame video footage:

- Me (http://steamcommunity.com/id/jerye/)

The process is simple:

1. You add me on steam and let me know which ones on this list you have.
2. I start a custom lobby for the both of us.
3. Once the game starts, buy 2 of each courier (and let me do the upgrade to the flying courier) that you have mentioned to me in 1.
4. You can then leave the game with my gratitude. :)
5. Don't be offended if I remove you from the friends list as I have wayyyyy too many people to record from that would fit on it.

Heres the rather large list of what i still need:

- These HUDs can be shared with anyone in the game, similar to how the Announcers are shareable.

- Radiant Ore and Direstone are available via Chest Series #23-25, whereas Cruel Diretide and Snows Of Frostivus are available via Chest Series #29.

- Powered Star, Stone Ruin and ESWC Diamond were a bonus gift for purchasing the StarSeries Season VI Ticket, The Premier League Season 5 Ticket and the Electronic Sports World Cup 2013 Ticket.

- Valor HUD was given out as a bonus for achieving the stretch goal for The International 3. It is currently the only Genuine HUD.

- Sometimes if you have the HUD equipped by default it may bug out and display incorrectly. In order to fix this all you need to do is select the default from the list and then re-select the HUD of your choosing. If this method doesnt work, you can select the default hud in-game and then go to your backpack and right click equip the HUD you wish to use.

- There are posts on the Dota 2 Subreddit explaining to users how they can modify their game files in order to have whatever HUD they desire.  You may do so if you feel the need to, they are however only viewable and not part of the Shared Content tab. It is currently unknown if this is a breach of the TOS for Steam as it is modifying the game client, and each time the game updates the files need to be re-modified in order to see the HUDs again.

I have no idea how this could have been done and have already changed the password of both my e-mail and Steam Account. 

I've sent a message to Steam Support but I'm not expecting a reply soon.

Here's a screenshot of my trade history, clearly showing the loss my whole inventory in only a few trades to the same account:

http://i.imgur.com/JcE1c.jpg

I believe the hijacker's account was http://steamcommunity.com/id/knobelym as shown in the screenshot. However, the items seem to have all been distributed away already.

After looking around I found that one of his friends (http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018474142) has an Unusual Seraphic Greevil very similar to the one a had lost (same Effect/Rank/Skills) but can not confirm that it is mine as I don't know how to view that single item's past owners.

If you guys need any more information, I'd gladly offer it.
Here's my Steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039464329

Any help would be greatly appreciated , I know you guys here can be really helpful. Upvotes would be also appreciated in order to have as many people see this as I can.

**EDIT**: I'm not on a LAN and use my own private internet connection. The reason I was hacked was because I was dumb enough to make my password for my steam and E-Mail incredibly similar only with the alteration of a number. I have now changed this problem but it's already too late.

If you'll take a look to the right of this post, you'll see that we're getting close to, if not already achieved, 2500 users. Wow! It was just a couple of weeks ago that I set up the 2000 user raffle. That's a 25% increase in users over two weeks. Crazy, right?

So anyway, here's the current state of the subreddit, for your viewing pleasure.

*****

* We are working with /u/rolmos, creator of the jaw-dropping layout and mod of /r/tf2trade, to implement a similar stylesheet for this subreddit. It will likely incorporate elements of the [Dota 2 blog](http://dota2.com), but I guarantee it will look slick as hell.

*****

* The general consensus regarding PSAs about new scammers was that we should add a [SCAMMER] post tag to the rules. I am fine with this, *however* there are some stipulations. I don't like the front page being cluttered with post upon post about someone getting scammed. It's a shame that it happened, and we know you want to warn the community, but with the implementation of this new [SCAMMER] tag, here are the new rules:

1. You may **only** create a [SCAMMER] thread if you can tie the scammer's Steam account to a Reddit account. This means screenshots and such. Use the same level of detail you would when filing a report on [SteamRep](http://steamrep.com). Users you encounter ""in the wild"" are not a top concern for this community.

2. [SCAMMER] threads will be taken down after 12 hours, only if they reach the front page of traffic. If they do not, they will remain in the ether.

3. If there are more than two [SCAMMER] threads on the front page at any given time, the oldest will be removed. We want the ""hot"" page to be used for interesting or high-traffic trade threads.

*****

* I have to remove probably 25-40 threads per day (seriously, check my comment history) for improper formatting, and boy does that get old. I am *this close* to bringing in the AutoModerator bot to trim these posts so I don't have to. However, instead of taking this course of action, I have decided to bring on **two more moderators** to help handle the mod queue. I am currently looking for one moderator to help with the US overnight queue (UTC +8 - +12) and another US (Pacific) mod. You may submit your application below, but here are the rules for applying:

1. You must have a reddit account older than 6 months. Additional moderator experience a plus, but not required.

2. You must be **clean** on Steamrep. Absolutely no exceptions. This also means you must have an active and permanent flair.

3. Your comment history must reflect a mature attitude. No trolling, putting down others, or breaking rules.

4. You must specify for which position you are applying. Either UTC +8-12 or UTC -8. This means either AUS/NZ and a Pacific coast US redditor.

5. You must explain why you would be a good moderator. English skills are a must.

Provided I see applications I like, I will make a decision in a few days and announce the new mods.

*****

That's all I can think of for now. Just **please be civil toward one another** and for the love of god, **STOP TRADING ACCOUNTS AND GAME KEYS**.

Love you lots,

Hammy",,False,,t5_2t22d,False,,trusted,True,t3_zch1c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/zch1c/psa_state_of_the_subreddit_address_please_read/,moderator

Update News:
Everyone who currently owns a Timebreaker will receive the replacement version of the weapon. Furthermore, the new Timebreaker is now a ‘Vintage’ quality weapon. Timebreakers that exist now are the only ones that will ever be until the end of time and thus the item rarity has been upgraded to ‘Immortal’.

Looking to help people out who are looking for cards.  Also, seriously.  Please don't randomly add me.  I'm ignoring adds, I'll add you.  Also, if you don't see a card in the list below, I don't have it, same if it's crossed out.  Sorry.

**How do I get a free card?**

Show me a screenshot of your compendium page for the team you want a card from.  If you have 2 or more players stamped, and I have the card you're missing, I'll add you on steam and give it to you.  The reason for that is I'd like to give the card to someone who will use it, not someone who will sell it.  Again, I will add you after you post a screenshot here. ***If you add me, I will ignore it*** . It's really easy to take a screenshot through steam and upload it to steamcloud.  Also, if you don't have a working flair, please post a link to your profile as well.

**Edit**: A few people have already given me some cards to add to this.  Thanks!  Any cards I don't give away in a few days will probably go to the trader card bot.  If you have dupes you don't want to deal with, I'll add them here.

**How can I help?**

If you have cards that you want to give away, and you would rather give them out yourself, post what you have in the comments, and what (if any) requirements you have, such as a screenshot.  This thread is NOT for trading, so your requirements can't be something like items.  **If you see someone donating cards in the comments**, please upvote that comment so people can see it, thanks.

**What cards can I get?**

Fnatic: Fly, Trixi

Rattlesnake: Luo

Quantic: Goblack, *Funzii*

MUFC: *Winter*

**This post wasn't started for the sets that came with the last update (CK set, new Lycan etc). All of the sets I made this thread for are now sold, except rubick set (restocked).**

BUT... I will buy any set you want from those released 1-2 hours ago from steam store.

Unfortunately I cant give very good prices on them as they 'll cost me steam funds to get them and prices are kinda fixed :/ You can probably buy them @ those prices from other traders as well.


So here we go :

* ~~Lycan 9 Keys~~   Steam funds not enough to buy another

* ~~CK 8 Keys~~      Steam funds not enough to buy another

* Bone 6 Keys  

* Weaver 5 Keys  

* Mortred 6 Keys  

* Razor 6 Keys  

* Rubick 6 Keys

* Beastmaster 4 Keys

I will add a rare for every set you purchase from me. 3 rares for buying 2 sets. 

I will give you 1 key discount for buying 3 sets.

My rares aren't trash rares, but u cant have tenderizer etc!

______________________________________________________________________________________________


**SOLD SETS** :

* ~~LYCAN, Sanguine Moon Set = 3 KEYS~~

* ~~WINDRUNNER, Featherfall Set = 4 KEYS~~

* ~~MIRANA, Nightsilver Set with Legendary Mount = 5 KEYS and 4 RANDOM RARES~~

* ~~WARLOCK Archivist Set = 4 KEYS and 3 RANDOM RARES~~

* ~~LONE DRUID Haruspex Set = 4 KEYS AND 3 RANDOM RARES~~


* ~~NYX Hidden Hive = 2 KEYS and 3 RANDOM RARES~~


* ~~LICH Dead Winter = 3 KEYS~~


* ~~RUBICK Zeal Set = 3 KEYS AND 2 RANDOM RARES **Restocked, same price again, 3 keys and 2 rares**~~


* ~~KOTL Empowered Vestments Set = 3 KEYS~~


Also selling :

* ~~Stache - 10 Keys 3 random rares (NO TAG)~~

* ~~Bastion Announcer - NO MEGA KILLS - 2 Keys~~

* Starladder ticket : 4 Keys

* G-1 League Ticket : 4 Keys

* American League Ticket : 3 Keys. I will add 1 rare

______________________________________________________________________________________________

If you dont want to trade random rares or you only have good rares, you can add 1 key and I will give you rares back. Not trash rares, I will let you choose from a list of 30 rares - most of them new.

I am trading ~50 good / new / tagged rares for random rares, 1:2. Would appreciate no WD / AXE rares, but can still do it. Have a look on page 5 here : http://tf2b.com/dota/76561197962878233

Post the link of someone selling a set cheaper and I ll beat that price, even by 2 rares.

Add me for a fast trade.

I've run this idea by the mods and gotten a thumbs up, so the next step is bringing it you, the redditors. I will be making a similar post in r/Dota2 and linking that here after I send my idea to those mods as there is some overlap. I chose to do it here first as I figured there would be a greater percentage of Dota 2 traders who are also players rather than vice versa.  

What follows (aside from a wall of text) is mostly cut and pasted from my messages with ham, and you can see there is many a detail to be ironed out, but that's why I am bringing it your hopefully agile minds! The genesis of the idea was winning a prize from the subreddit raffle and thinking about how I could best give back to the community.

I'm definitely a small time trader, but I am a much more experienced and skilled DotA 2 player. Before Dotabuff elicited Valve's wrath, I saw that my 'rating' is in the top 1% of players and I even have a small bit of comp experience (Tobi-wan said I did a good job laning against TidesofTime so it must be true! :P) I also have a lot of practice with strict self-organization and meeting deadlines, thanks to my time working in television and my current job teaching English to well over 500 different students here in lovely Barcelona.

I think that I could put my (admittedly limited) time to good use developing the playing of Dota 2 among traders. My specific ideas are as follows and I'd love to hear your feedback about the feasibility of each:

1) A spin on the '1v1 Mid for rares.' This is the simplest plan to put into motion, and I would base the 1v1 play details heavily on the 'Fistful of Tangos' event. Have a sign up for those interested in a 1v1 'league' culminating in a playoff. While I could collect items as entry fee, and then eventually payout all of them accordingly, that seems like an added layer of complexity. Instead I'll just use some items I have (The First Bloods mod I just won seems perfect for a 1v1 award no?) or if it is popular use items that are donated by people who support the idea. I also have a small bit of experience utilizing Twitch as I made some Dota videos to teach my university friends my thought process while I am playing Dota, so casting some playoff games if the community is interested is very possible.

2) Essentially same idea as above, but how Dota is meant to be played: 5v5! Players could sign up in teams or solo and then be placed into teams. I think I would sort the teams based on time and activity in the subreddit to avoid highly skilled 'ringers' ruining a traders' series of games. That or sort it into levels. I would definitely cast or employ a caster for these. A former Gamers University player is a good friend and I know he would help out co-casting and could ask some other more well-known NA/EU players to lend a hand making this a fun spectacle. The trading aspect could range from minor (items as prizes for games won, overall league performance, playoffs) to major, where teams bet items against the other; winner take all. If the games are popular, maybe even have Dota2Trade spectators join the betting fun!

3) The first two ideas I could certainly arrange if public opinion deems them worthy. This last one I can't guarantee will happen, but I do have a few contacts among the elite of Dota 2 play, so it's possible (given the right participants) for Dota2Trading team(s) to participate in small, but nonetheless official Dota 2 tournaments. The major benefit of this being tournament items dropping with your own name on them, and I think that many a collector who uses this subreddit would jump at that chance to have such items on the market. This is the most nebulous of my ideas, but I wanted to submit it to you regardless.

The first of many things needed: participation. Would you like to see any of these thoughts come to fruition? If so, which ones, and what do you think is the best way to run it? Would you participate in any of the above? You're welcome to PM me, but I'd prefer you leave your 2 cents in the comments so we can discuss as a community. 

Thank you for your time, and please continue to make this subreddit as lovely as can be,

Nate

First Edit for paragraphing

Second Edit: Positive response so far! It's possible that starting small and garnering more of the community's attention with a previous success will be necessary, so I'm not opposed to leading with #1 and building up from there. I'll be paying close attention to the thread, so please feel free to make direct suggestions in the comments as well. 

Third Edit: Contacted an /r/Dota2 mod to start bringing in more interested players.

''Na`Vi.Puppey [Na`Vi] scored a double kill against LGD-GAMING in WB Match G 2/3 of The International at 28:09 on Sun Sep 02 14:11:17 2012.''

Story: It was the 2nd game where Navi is down 0-1 and LGD got complete map control in game 2. They somehow sniped Puppey(Lycan) but puppey manage to score a triple kills with his wolves which change the game momentum into Navi favor. This also mark the very FIRST lose of LGD in TI2, arguably the best series in TI2. The courier is DEFINITELY something a Navi fan would wana keep.

All Ethereal Flames with Indigo color. Not selling individually.

Second Highest : $1,400 - leochinho

     
**Sale Information**
      
**Reserve: 1,400 keys** (Subject to change as market prices for these couriers keep rising, and I am of mind to believe this reserve as quite fair. I will not adjust the Reserve as soon as reserve is met.)

**Miscellaneous information for the buyers / redditors / collectors**
Collecting these couriers now are EXTREMELY hard as many have already disappeared from the market. This is a complete set of all the old couriers.
      
Breakdown of the **fair market value** for the couriers:
     
Frog : ~370k
     
Dog ~ 290k
      
Yak ~ 160k
       
Stumpy ~140k
      
Badger ~110k
        
Morok ~70k
       
Boar ~80k
       
Demon ~110k
      
All in all, this is a total of ~1,300 keys. This is just the current market price of the couriers as I have been watching the market for these couriers. These indigo couriers are extremely have not appeared for *weeks* and has taken me a considerable amount of time (1.5 months) of hunting, searching, negotiating and tracking people down. I do not mind that the offers are currently low, but the value of these couriers have only been going up at a fast pace. It will not take long for them to reach 1,400 keys if they have not already. 
      
**I highly encourage you to bid aggressively on this as these couriers are in high demand, competition is fierce, and any of these couriers just almost never come on the market. And the EF market is only going up at an extremely fast rate.**

1363878914.0,21,self.Dota2Trade,1aqhme,[PSA] Valve has lifted 200-sale limit on Steam Community Market (the catch inside),lak3108,23,2,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1aqhme/psa_valve_has_lifted_200sale_limit_on_steam/,"The catch: US residents and citizens must provide information to Valve for compliance with IRS tax code in order to exceed the 200-sale limit. HOWEVER, Valve is not required to report your earnings to the IRS unless you also exceed $20,000 in annual sales. Non-US residents/citizens must simply fill out a form to confirm non-residency, as long as they have never used a US billing address.
From the FAQ:
&gt; **Is there a limit on the number of transactions I can participate in in the Community Market?**
Currently there is no limit on the number of transactions you can participate in. However, the United States Internal Revenue Service, under Section 6050W of the Internal Revenue Code, requires us to collect certain information from you if you engage in more than 200 separate sales transactions in a calendar year. In particular, **if you are a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide us with your name, address and Social Security Number, and **if you are not a U.S. citizen or resident**, you will need to provide evidence of your non-U.S. status on an online form we provide to you. We will be providing a link to these forms and a process by which you can provide the needed information if and as you approach the 200 sales limit. We may use a third-party to collect this information. You can choose not to provide this information if you wish, but you will not be able to list any items for sale in the Community Market once you meet the 200 sales threshold, and any items listed will be removed. Note that, while we are required to collect this information from you, we are not required to share this information with the IRS under Section 6050W unless you exceed $20,000 in gross sales in the Community Market within a single calendar year. For purposes of calculating the number of sales you have made in a calendar year, all of your accounts will be treated as a single account.

And:

&gt; **Will you be providing 1099’s based on my transactions in the Community Market?**
The United States Internal Revenue Service requires us to report gross sales for, and provide IRS Form 1099’s to, only those subscribers who are U.S. citizens or residents and who exceed 200 sales transactions in a calendar year and also exceed $20,000 in gross sales proceeds from those sales transactions in that same calendar year, from all of that subscriber's accounts. If you are a U.S. citizen or resident and exceed both of these thresholds, we will report the amount of gross sales to the IRS and provide you with Form 1099.

* If you get the ""Yikes! Something has gone wrong!"" page, simply go back to http://dota2.trade.redditgaming.com/start and repeat the process from the beginning until it works.

* If you get a 500 internal server error page, you must wait short while and repeat the process from the beginning.

* If you successfully complete steps 1 and 2 and you do NOT get a message from SteamBot, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) and we will investigate. Alternatively, you could message /u/drkabob yourself and ask your question.

* If you get the ""You already have flair"" error, send a message to /u/drkabob and PM the mods. We will try to get it sorted.

* If you experience any sort of strangeness (e.g., being assigned the wrong flair), PM the mods and /u/drkabob to report the error.

Please refer to my [last PSA](http://redd.it/19jnya) for the reasons why we need this and how it works.

## My Dota 2 invite for You 2 keys
## My 1 Common for Your (1 common + 4 chests)
## My 16 chests (series 3-16) for your 1 common

1. pick the items you like from [my backpack](http://tf2b.com/dota/76561198071152092).
1. find the price from table
1. multiply with 1.20

(if you didnt check the pics on my profile, you should) however im going to explain it again:
he added me for the unusual morok i had, offering my 35usd by paypal, i didnt have a paypal acc so i said no. Then he asked for a middleman which i was going to do the same thing, i agreed with this since it was safe. He couldnt find anyone (i was searching too but everyone was offline or afk). After that, he gave me an option about adding steam wallet by giving him my steam email but he wanted the courier first. I mean, he looked so serious after searching for a middleman (as i said i was searching too) so i accepted and he said ""keep refreshing, you should have it now"" and then he deleted me changing his avatar and nickname.

Initially, i used this steam feature because of many people i dealed with. But since i started to trade some higher level items like unusual couriers, Hooks and TBs i did noticed it helps alot to recognize some scammers. They usually show themselves when you're trying to sell or buy some stuff with real money.   

This feature is... *drumroll* a [steam nickname](http://i.imgur.com/0bWGSVk.jpg)! YES! YOU'VE GOT IT RIGHT. THE **STEAM NICKNAME**!  
The fastest, safest and easiest way to help yourself. Just tag every person who add you with a nickname (i personally use the ""unknown"" tag). If this unknown person will suddenly (mostly, they do this when you're offline or when you're already talking with a potential buyer of some your item) transform his nickname from *xXKilla97Xx* to *Leon [dota2traders.com]* you'll still have the ""unknown"" tag on him!  
   
&gt;**Some tips and tricks**:  
**1**.Add every SR middleman from [here](http://steamrep.com/list/M) and give them ""the real one"" tag. You can cancel the friend request after doing so, but **the tag will remain for an infinite period**.  
**2**.Your tags will appear in the profile and the chat.  
**3**.Normally the impersonator changes his steam name when you're offline or trading via real money. Be sure to check your friendlist from time to time for the ""unknown"" tag and see if there will be some ""wuvs"" or ""Luckybunny"".  
**4**.Once the scammer is recognized you can block him. You can find every blocked user via profile/friendlist/[blocked users](http://i.imgur.com/GkAXKFz.jpg) if desired.  
**5**.Check the nickname history of every person who add you. Most of the retarded scammers have multiple Jerry + Leon + wuvs etc nicknames there.  
**6**. [AONomad](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997100108) says its a good idea to use the Tag option (not the nickname one) for middlemen in your friendlist. This way you can find them more easily since they appear as the group.

I'm not really a part of the DotA 2 trading community, as I'm still fairly new to the game(about 5 months) and wanted to amass a stash before I begun. Today seems like a good day to start, seeing as I dropped my 3rd Courier. Lucky, right?

This is where y'all come in. I will be raffling off a clean, dropped, sparkling new Enduring War Dog. I just love my Stumpy way too much to ever give this Dog a good run-around, so I wanted to see him off into a good home. 

To enter this raffle I require naught but the following:

* Your reddit account must be at least 1 month old.
* You must have Steam flair activated (although I gather this is mandatory now)
* You must comment below with the following exactly: #yolo

This is my first post here so please be nice if I have managed to cock up this painfully simple task!

I'll pick a winner tomorrow at some time in the evening, UK time for me, as I'm heading off to bed now.

Good luck and happy raffling!

Edit: Have to say I was not expecting this many replies haha, will pick a winner in a couple of hours! Also I guess it's just posts including 'yolo' seeing as I didn't realise the whole reddit hashtag formatting thing messes it up.

Edit 2: Picked a winner using redditraffle.com, congratulations to MrNiceLookingGuy! The result can be viewed here: http://i.imgur.com/9pVulh6.png

*****

**Regulile de postare/schimb**

1. **Regula de baza:** Nu scrie postari sau comentarii care dezavantajeaza alti useri sau creeaza conflict.Comenturile si postarile ofensive,neadecvate ,sexiste,rasiste sau comenturi puse degeaba vor fi sterse iar cel care a postat ar putea fi supus unui ban.

2. **Postarea degeaba**: Deranjand schimburile altora si/sau oferind comentariu asupra pretului fara sa iti fie ceruta asta va rezulta intr-un ban de o saptamana pentru cel ce a postat.Va fi responsabilitatea ta sa trimiti un mesaj moderatorilor dupa o saptamana sa ceri unban.Furtul/deraierea postarilor altora este de asemenea impotriva regulilor si ar putea rezulta intr-un ban.

3. **Vinderea itemelor pe Paypal/Moneypak**: Este admisa.Economia pare si se comporta mult asemenea celei din Team Fortress 2 .Asta inseamna ca ,totusi riscanta mereu,este relativ un proces simplu.Foloseste mereu un om de mijloc aprobat de SteamRep (www.steamrep.com/list/M) sau un moderator al acestui subreddit pentru a vinde un item in siguranta.Uita-te in sectiunea notelor pentru mai multe informatii

4. **Iteme din Dota2 pentru jocuri**: Aceasta va fi admisa aici,dar doar jocuri Steam vor fi permise pentru schimburi.Asta inseamna fara CD-keyuri,coduri de joc,seriale si chestii de genul.Regula aceasta se aplica de asemenea oricaror bundleuri HumbleBundle pentru ca consideram ca jocurile humblebundle nu trebuie cumparate cu scopul de a face profit.Aceleasi principii se aplica si altor chestii precum cadouri iTunes si asa mai departe.

5. O **singura** postare pe 8 ore. Va rugam nu depasiti aceasta limita.Nu aveti voie sa va stergeti postarile mai vechi pentru a trece peste aceasta regula


6. **Formatarea posturilor**: Va rugam folositi urmatorul tipar pentru a posta schimburi aici (Nota: **folositi litere de tipar!**):

&gt; **[H] Caciulita de Bloodseeker [W] Caciulita de Pudge**

In plus, daca vreodata o valoare din dota2 este comparabila cu acea a sistemului “refined metal” din TF2,setarea preturilor pentru itemele tale va fi obligatorie si restrictionata.Pana atunci ingaduim postarile de tipul [W] Offers. Acest tip de postare gen licitatie nu este aprobat in tf2 deoarece este prezent un sistem de “valuta”,care nu exista pentru moment in Dota2.

*Update:* Postarile de tip licitatie trebuie sa contina un **pret de rezerva** si un **timp final.** Postarile care nu contin aceste lucruri vor fi sterse.In plus, noi putem si vom bana pe acei care nu onoreaza o oferta care trece de pretul de rezerva dupa timpul final al licitatiei

**Alte taguri pentru postare** 

Poti de asemenea sa postezi folosind urmatoarele taguri:

* [PC] – indica o verificare a pretului

* [Q] – indica o intrebare

* [Store] – indica faptul ca vinzi 5 sau mai multe iteme deodata

* [Raffle] – indica faptul ca creezi o loterie **gratis** (doar acestea vor fi permise)

* [PSA] – indica faptul ca prezinti o informatie importanta sau relevanta pentru comunitate(de exemplu: “[PSA] 
Sepcile de Dota2 pot fi folosite de mai multi eroi”

* [Free] – indica faptul ca daruiesti iteme gratis

* [SCAMMER] – Acest tag poate fi folosit DOAR in cazul reportarii unui scammer gasit aici pe subreddit.Va rugam sa nu postati [SCAMMER] daca nu puteti conecta contul lor steam de contul lor de reddit.Va rugam sa includeti detaliile adecvate pentru a posta un scammer pe SteamRep

* [Idea] – acest tag este  DOAR acceptat daca anuntati moderatorii inainte.Va rugam sa trimiteti un mesaj moderatorilor inainte sa postati.

* [Auction] – acest tag este folosit doar cand prezentati o licitatie pentru itemul care il vindeti.Trebuie sa includeti un  pret de rezerva si un  timp limita. Daca cumva nu onorati o oferta mai buna sau egala cu pretul dumneavoastra de rezerva dupa expirarea timpului de rezerva,veti fi banat permanent din aceasta comunitate.


*****

**Note**

* Susvotati bazandu-va pe preturi si pe o postare corecta a postului,nu pentru ca vi s-a cerut asta(exceptand cazurile PSA-urilor facute de moderatori)

* Nu cersisti susvoturi.Aceste postari vor fi sterse

* Folositi un tag per postare.Nu combinati tagurile

* Evaziunea banarii si folosirea altor conturi pentru evita regula celor 8 ore va rezulta in banuri severe

* Scammeri vor fi reportati la  /r/badkarma precum si SteamRep.Noi nu toleram astfel de comportament

* Schimbul de conturi de orice fel  este strict interzis.Violeaza codul EULA in intregime si este in general foarte ne-sigur

* Preturile itemelor nu sunt niciodata batute in piatra.Lucruri precum liste sau site-uri de verificare a preturilor sunt folositoare pentru a obtine o idee generala asupra valorii unui item,dar determinantul real al valorii este piata.Gasind alte exemple ale itemului tau pe piata si ce cer altii pentru el este singurul mod de a obtine o evaluare precisa.

* Daca schimbi un item pentru Paypal/Moneypak este foarte sugerat sa folosesti un admin de pe SteamRep. Un om de mijloc reduce mult riscul de a fi furat,dar riscurile mosteninte prin vanzarea unui item pentru bani raman acolo,insemnand ca folosirea unui om de mijloc nu prezinta imunitate la furatul prin chargeback.Vindeti pe propriul dumneavoastra risc! **Verificati profilul cumparatorului pe SteamRep** sa vedeti daca acea persoana este un hot cunoscut!

I've been working on a project to turn all of those flairs into something a little more useful for trading - a project called Flair Linker Enhanced. I'm pleased to announce that my project is finally done!

What does this do, you ask? It turns this:

* [Old and busted](http://i.imgur.com/jdHHV.png)

Into this:
 
* [New hotness](http://i.imgur.com/hXx8x.png)

What is all that, you may wonder? You get:

* Steam profile names and presence information!
    * Check to see if a user is online!
    * Join them in a game if Steam supports it!

* Useful quick links!
    * Add friend
    * Send message
    * Subreddit-specific links:
        * Inventory, games list, and wishlist for /r/SteamGameSwap
        * Various backpack viewers for /r/tf2trade and /r/Dota2Trade

* SteamRep integration!
    * Check if a user is reported on SteamRep just by hovering over their name!
    * _Special thanks to [Mattie](http://steamrep.com/profiles/76561197971691194) for letting me beta-test the SteamRep web API._

* Integration across multiple subreddits!

***All right! I'm sold! How do I install this wonderful bit of technology?***

First of all, you'll need to be using Firefox or Chrome. If you can get this working on another browser, feel free, but I haven't tested this there.

## Firefox Installation Instructions

0. Uninstall or disable any other flair-linker addons you might have installed.
1. Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. Restart Firefox
3. Click [the download link][dl]
4. Click ""Install"" on the dialog box that appears.
5. Go enjoy your new fancy flair!

## Chrome Installation Instructions

This script works natively in Chrome - no extra extensions are required. However, Chrome 21+ users will need to jump through some hoops to get this installed due to new security checks in Chrome.

Installation Instructions:

* Uninstall or disable any other flair-linker addons you might have installed.
* Chrome 20:
    * Click [the download link.][dl]
    * Continue below.
* Chrome 21+:
    * Right-click [the download link.][dl]
    * Use ""Save Link As"" to save the script to your desktop.
    * Open chrome://extensions.
    * Drag the script you saved above onto the extensions page.
    * Continue below.
* Click ""Keep"" in the download bar.
* Click ""Install"" on the dialog box that appears.
* Enjoy!

***

***HELP! It won't work!***

First, try these common troubleshooting steps:

* Refresh the page you're on.
* Restart your browser.
* Make sure that Steam Community and SteamRep aren't experiencing downtime. If they go down, the corresponding parts of the script will stop working.
* Reinstall the script.

If that won't work, try posting in the comments below.

I am sure you all took my message to heart last time, but I figured I would remind you again just in case.

Instead of mailing the moderators regarding middlemanning I would advise you to add me directly. It is likely I will reply faster and can get you sorted. If you go to add me and I am offline, I would then recommend trying the moderator mail or a different website.

Note: You can add me through my flair next to me name :)

Now, to the scamming.

Recently a number of people have been impersonating known middlemen. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE check that their steam profile matches the steamrep page for the real middleman. Do not do anything you are not comfortable with or seems suspicious or silly in any form. Do not let them pressure you!!

THIS PROCESS IS MANDATORY FOR ALL USERS TO BE ABLE TO POST THREADS AND COMMENTS ON THIS SUBREDDIT HENCEFORTH. I will make this as clear and simple as possible.

**Steps:**

1. Visit http://dota2.trade.redditgaming.com/start and click ""Allow.""

2. You will be redirected to the Steam web login page via the Steam WebAPI. If you are not already signed in to Steam, enter your login info. If you are already logged in, simply click ""Login.""

3. Confirm that SteamBot has sent you a message on Reddit informing you that you have been added as an approved submitter for this subreddit.

That's it! Three simple clicks.

Here's the part where I explain what to do in the event that something goes wrong.

* If you get the ""Yikes! Something has gone wrong!"" page, simply go back to http://dota2.trade.redditgaming.com/start and repeat the process from the beginning until it works.

* If you get a 500 internal server error page, you must wait short while and repeat the process from the beginning.

* If you successfully complete steps 1 and 2 and you do NOT get a message from SteamBot, [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDota2Trade) and we will investigate. Alternatively, you could message /u/drkabob yourself and ask your question.

* If you get the ""You already have flair"" error, send a message to /u/drkabob and PM the mods. We will try to get it sorted.

* If you experience any sort of strangeness (e.g., being assigned the wrong flair), PM the mods and /u/drkabob to report the error.

I would just like to say one thing regarding the Golden Greevil.  Many people are saying that ""it looks like shit"", but when it first came out (so the supply was very small), it went for 20+ keys, whereas the timebreaker when for around 15+ keys when it first came out. 

Therefore, if there is a very limited amount of golden greevils available for sale, then the value of the Golden Greevil would be very high.  Over time, the available supply will become smaller and smaller.  People who do like the item will keep it, and hoarders will hoard more and more GGs.  Both the GG and the Vintage Timebreaker were considered initially ""ugly"" by many.  

Perhaps it will take the full release of dota2 and the consequential large increase in playerbase for the GGs to go up.

Finally, I would like to condemn all the price manipulators.  They single-handedly caused the GG to crash.

My 2 cents, if anyone cares.

---

Discussion is welcome, provided that we all act how /r/dota2trade has always acted; civilized, mannered, and logical. 

---

Argument 1: The courier market is oversaturated so the Golden Greevil won't rise.

My Response: The Max Head in tf2 is a hat (which is the equivalent of a courier, hats have unusual effects etc., tons of different models).  Just because the GG is a courier doesn't mean it wont rise.

""Why are Max's Heads more expensive than Big Kills?

Max's Head is an all-class hat. Big kill is a re-skin for a spy weapon that not every spy uses. Big difference in demand there.""

I was kinda annoyed, since the main reason for getting an unusual is to show off, right? I heard before that the sunfire effect didn't show up very well for people playing on low settings.

Today, I had some time, and decided to take a look at why some people say the sunfire effect is hardly noticeable. I took a screenshot of the effect at high, low and medium qualities, and found that the biggest factor in how the effect looks is the setting ""World Lighting""; turning this setting on makes a huge difference.

**Screenshots:**

**High quality(everything on/maxed)**

Color Code: 208, 119, 51

c/o: 1 common + invoker chest

I have a particular interest in Master's Assassin parts (except for Shruiken), willing to value these much higher than normal commons/uncommons for fees. 

Also these Furion/NP Stranges; Runestaff of Verodocia, Horns of Noblesse, Cape of Verdant Dreaming, Horns of the Forest Lord, Pauldron of Al-Fusha, and Tusked Bracers. Willing to trade for these as well. Also **Normal Toga of the Peacebringer**


This is my backpack, everything is available for rental/trade EXCEPT for page 5 (This is where I keep collateral).

http://www.tf2outpost.com/backpack/147245/570


The raffle has been cancelled as of now. Seems there is a lack of interest in the prize, will hold a better one once I start getting some rentals!

I am selling Amnesia the Dark Descent, a Deathwielder, and a Pangolin Bounty Hunter set with 2 strange uncommons. 

A special thanks for Magari and TheRealTTN for renting my first items!
 
***How it works:*** 

* Choose an announcer or courier to rent 

* Find its collateral value, and fee in TABLE 1

* Decide which items you will give me as collateral by using TABLE 2 (Point values should match)

* Decide how long you plan on renting the item for, then calculate the fee

* Pay the fee if you are doing a one week rental

* Post here with what item you are renting, the collateral you are giving me, and your expected length of rental

* I will fill out the rental form for you, read it over, copy it, and post it

* Trade me for your items!

* Return the items and the fee for your collateral

 **IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO GIVE COLLATERAL**, I do offer no collateral rentals or reduced collateral rentals to those who are qualified. Generally require good paypal rep or something similar to do 0 collateral.

Even if you don't have significant paypal rep, can shave points off your collateral requirement depending on various other factors. 

If you are interested, please post here and I will get back to you.
 



**Collateral:**


* Collateral refers to items that you give me to hold until you return my items. The value of the collateral generally exceeds that of the items you are renting. This is to ensure that I can quickly restock my items if you do not return them. 


* If you meet the terms of the agreement, I am obligated to return your collateral when you return my items plus the rental fee. I consider this a trust trade as much as a Paypal trade, if I break our agreement, I fully expect and deserve to be reported as a scammer.


I will **never** trade your items, nor will I use them without your permission.


*Fees*


I charge a small fee to rent my items. For each item available for rental I have listed the daily and weekly price. I will accept pretty much any item for a fee, feel free to ask if you can pay with ""x"".

**Weekly rates**


The weekly fee is always cheaper than paying the daily fee. If you wish to take advantage of the weekly fee, I ask that you pay the fee upfront. If you choose to return the item early, I will charge the daily rate + 1 day.

**Daily Rates**


 
* If you choose to pay on a daily basis, you don’t need to pay the fee upfront. Let me know how many days you intend on keeping the item for (&lt;2 weeks), and you can pay me when you return it.



* Items in **TABLE 2** and **TABLE 3** will be accepted for fees, if you have something I haven't listed, please ask.



***Late Fees***


* I charge the daily rate for every day over the expected duration that you keep my items. No extra fee. 

* If you keep my items 5 days after the expected rental, I'll ask you to pay any accrued fees to that point.

* If you don't pay your fees when I ask 5 days after the expected rental, I have the right to sell your items. 

I don't want to ever do that, if you think you may have a problem paying, or returning the items on time let know. I'm friendly and lenient.

please beware of everything that Sparkyz/bambi/messi sells, if i am not wrong he has been caught up with duplicated TI2 couriers multiple times. 

Since these 2 have offered me their drodos almost concurrently, I beleive they are trying to get rid of it, please do not trade without due caution as I believe they may be involved in the duplication process.


**EDIT**: History of Drodo updated

let me once again bring up the History of the drodo directly from tf2 Outpost

Last 5 owners of the drodo are as follows:

RAZRAZ 591465442

MuXaHcKu 579879516

Sparky™ 581664625

RAZRAZ 576489625

apex 553229201

Seeing that the 2 copies of the drodo exist in Sparky and RAZRAZ inventory now, the duplication must have been done after the trade from apex.

Note that RAZRAZ AKA EKX77 ON REDDIT traded the drodo he had to MuxachKu his brother or whatever THEN traded the drodo back to himself.

In my opinion a poor way to legitimise a drodo he obviously had a hand in duplicating.

--------------------------------------------------------------

**How it happens**
-

To sum it up as simply as possible, when someone reports their steam account to valve customer support as ""Highjacked"" i.e, broken into via a phishing website, most if not all of their items that were stolen will be returned to them

The **problem** is that the items that were stolen are not always deleted, for reasons which i am not really sure, thus creating duplicates.

The other issue, which might not concern you but does effect the market quite significantly is that making duplicates of these unique items significantly decreases their valve, in some cases, and is very unfortunate for an uninformed investor.

-------------------------------------------------------------

**A recent example** (there have been more, but i unfortunately didn't save them thinking nothing of it, but im sure someone has saved them (an XBOCT ti2 courier comes to mind?)
-

[This] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1f9loo/auctionlegacyunique_morok_light_blue_re_in_3_days/) Light blue RE morok has been the most recent example (that i can think of), you can tell it is a duplicate thanks to the detective work of others, but i'll post it here (The owner of the original in this case is believed to be Abrakk):

* This is a link to the light blue RE morok on Tf2 outpost - ""http://www.tf2outpost.com/item/570/506660920"" . 

* It has a unique ID, each person listed has had the courier in their inventory and the person at the top should be the only person that has it. In this case, two people have it.

Sorry if this information is already known by most, but i personally didn't realize. Just be extra vigilant with your trades!

1369583961.0,19,self.Dota2Trade,1f330i,[PSA] About trade bans and trade probation,barcodee,26,7,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1f330i/psa_about_trade_bans_and_trade_probation/,"Personally, i got trade banned like 2-3 weeks ago because i bought a hook which was seemingly $10 cheaper. Returned home one day and found out i was trade banned, with the hook deleted from my inventory. Of course, the seller disappeared altogether as well. I sent tickets to steam, to no avail. Therefore i decided to wait it out. I lost many good offers on my (tournament smeevil,drodo and others) during that period just because the buyers got impatient and retracted. It definitely made me lose alot in terms of cash and items. 



In the end, when i got unbanned 2 weeks later(1st offence is 2 weeks, subsequently it's 3 months  and perma banned if i'm not mistaken) i realised i was on trade probation. This posed another issue as people began to suspect me. And steam couldn't do a thing about my trade probation. Likewise, because of this red text above my name, many people shunned dealing with me despite me meeting their b/o prices and all. Sometimes i would even add people and they just block me, refuse the request, or add me and when they noticed, just said, sorry you're a scammer, cant trade with you and deleted me.




I made this psa not to gain sympathy, but to let people know, some innocent traders have been hurt by such scammers who are quick-selling. People have been trade banned for buying keys which have been purchased via a stolen credit card. But you cant blame them, who could? Not everyone who is trade banned is a bad person, and the trade probation tells you should be cautious. 




On a high note, i met wonderful traders in patt and a few others who went ahead with big transactions with me despite my trade probation status. 








An example of this would be: 

Guy A's account has been compromised. 
(:http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1f26km/psa_my_account_has_been_hijacked/)

Hacker in Guy A's account quicksells to Guy B 
( http://dota2traders.com/threads/smeevil-for-400-paypal-or-wu.70555/)


Guy A ticket to steam will get through, steam will probably return the items to Guy A as it's his first time being hijacked. Guy B inventory history will show ( + smeevil, - nothing) and steam will assume it's a case of item transfer from hijacked account. 



Guy B's smeevil is deleted and hijacker profits $400, innocent buyer loses. (This is also how items are duped)



Nevertheless, beware of those who have trade bans and trade probations, just keep in mind some are people who have been affected and can't do a thing about it. 






TLDR : Not everyone who is on trade ban or trade probation is a bad guy or a bad trader scammer(quoted from a random guy with no rep that labelled me the moment i added him), some have been affected by the scammers who are quick-selling. There's nothing that we can do about it.

I was wondering, how much daily profit have Valve from the community Marketplace.

Using Excel, i has calculated this out of Commission fees for transactions (15%)

In the calculation were:

* Keys (Treasure, Crystalline, Diretide, Cursed Wood, Shaper Divine, Lotus, dark, Sithil Summer);
* Genuine stuff;
* Immortal stuff;
* Essences and Eggs;
* Battle Bonuses;
* Description, Name Tags;
* Strange Modifiers;
* Pennants;
* Most popular Treasure chests (Series #11, #22, #26, #28, #29, #30).

No Tournament stuff... :(


Calculation date - **March 31**

Grand total: **more than 2000$**

Maximum Value: **1815 Treasure Keys - ~653$**


So, Community Marketplace annual revenue can provide **~45%** of The International 2013 Prize pool :)

Sorry for bad english :P

It's one of a kind, I've seen other pinks before, but nothing like this one.  Most pinks are either pinkish-purple, or closer to white.  This is a true bubble gum pink legacy courier, only one I've ever seen.

The offers I've seen come in have been going up month after month, but I still don't know where the legacy market is right now.  Can you guys give me some insight on what you think the true value is today, and what the value could be in 1-2 years?

One reliable offer I have on the table right now is $1,500 cash + some extras.  I've had others in the trade community though tell me it's worth over $3,000.

First of all, we were 5 random players that found 5 found players in a diretide match.At that time the record was kept by a team that had players from TI2(CoL gaming )and none of us would believe that we could beat the 0:00:39.When we were about to try beat the record ( last mins ) our hands were shaking and each and every of us were so thrilled and excited but still none of us really thought that we would win. When we saw the 0:00:39 on our screens we were so happy and after all, we had made it.We won some competitive players.That is the story for all those who say that cycle1 couriers are the best.

I have over 627 items in my inventory, bidding will end Saturday when I feel like it. Prefer one single transaction but I will break it up if the price is right. Feel free to message me if you have any questions. 

Reason for selling: I was already planning on giving up video games for my New Year's resolution, and today I was unexpectedly laid off from my job, so yeah. Anybody in the Seattle area hiring IT? :D

Here's the long list, sorry about the wall of text, want to make sure if people are looking for individual items they can find this in search. Also I have a pretty big inventory and this helps illustrate that haha

Notable items: Greevil collection including x3UE greedy and golden, couriers, diretide, some stranges

EDIT: reserve at $100 paypal, equivalent to 40 keys. My couriers alone are worth that much, help a brother out!

Added me offering to buy my courier for 3 rare items.

He was offering to buy them up at the same value because 'all I care about is rare items'.

I inspected his inventory and saw that he had one! Ah, so I offer to buy his! I tell him I felt sorry for him having a sunfire item as well, and since I had many items I would make him a very good trade, far above what he offered me for my Speed Demon sunfire courier. 

He said ""Lol"" and declined the trade. Asked me again if I wanted his trade because his ""friend at Valve"" warned him.

**General Info:** All these are unique unobtainable colours ([info](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/zvyf4/psa_unusual_deliverers_colour_guido/), obsolete a bit) and some are extremely rare. One is mine and rest two belong to my friends who would like me to handle the sale. B/Os and Reserves would be settled soonishly.

**Trade Notes:** **Each of us is looking for Western Union transfer through middleman.** Unfortunately PayPal offers cannot be accepted. High value ingame item offers are available but as its all heading to Western Union sale in the end anyway, due to the commission for selling each piece separately they would be accepted below their market price (depends; discussable).

then i did some research, after first 12 hours of unboxing, i saw only few immortal couriers on sale.. but after 36 hours, u can see 5pages of posts about selling these couriers on d2l and lots of lots of posts in reddit.. its only 1-2 days of unboxing and we got that much couriers on market.. imagine how many couriers would be at the end of the expirary date (Aug 12).. don't forget tournament courier drops also..  
my point is TI3 couriers are not gonna be as expensive as TI2 couriers.. may be TI3 couriers might fall as low as half the price of TI2 couriers.. so be careful when u think of investing one..   
what u guys think?",,False,,t5_2t22d,False,,,True,t3_1j7ma3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1j7ma3/pc_ti3_immortal_couriers_and_discuss_thread/,
1374727187.0,18,self.Dota2Trade,1j0b25,[Q] Is EF really rare as everyone says?,Delth,28,10,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1j0b25/q_is_ef_really_rare_as_everyone_says/,"This question has been bugging me for a while and since there's no way to tell how many unusual couriers with certain effects exist, everyone just goes and assumes EF couriers' drop rate is the lowest in any crate and that's why it's expensive, not only because it does look better.

There have been many chests with the usual old effects, but the Wax one had 11 different effects and it was the first time Roshan, Cluckles, Drake, Llama, Kupu, Nimble and Tegu got the old effects applied on them. Recently I've been making claims about the rarity of specific-effects on couriers that came out of the Wax crate. 

Roshan, for example. According to the amount of unusual Roshans that exist in public inventories (1250 public, should be ~1600 in total counting private), around 150-200 are unboxed per event but we have a growing community which leads me to assume around 240 were unboxed from the Wax chest. 

And I just divided that number into the 11 different effects so I say less than 30 Sunfire Roshans exist, less than 30 EF Roshans exist, but also less than 30 Searing, Vermin, or any old effect from it exist.

Most people who read this just dish this claim away without thinking about it and say EF is the rarest just because.

Well, thinking about it, I went through 12 pages of every single trade in dota2lounge for three couriers:

* Morok: It has been around since the beginning, I thought it would be good to see how many of each effect exist since it's been in every single box to date.

* Baby Roshan: It never was in any hero chest and didn't get the ""old effects"" until the Wax one, but it was in all of the event crates (except Sunfire), but now it has had Diretide and Frostivus effects in two crates.

* Llama: Same as Roshan except it wasn't in Diretide or Frostivus. Only 8 pages of trades exist for this one unlike the others. 

And this is what I counted; note I avoided counting the same couriers more than once, if a trader had two or more trades with the same courier only one would be counted.


Effect | Morok | Roshan | Llama
:----|:-----:|:------:|:------:
AoV | 11 | 0 | 2
LG | 6 | 0 | 1
PB | 6 | 0 | 2
RE | 11 | 4 | 1
SE | 8 | 1 | 1
BA | 15 | 1 | 2
FB | 7 | 3 | 3
EF | 10 | 1 | 1
SF | 6 | 3 | 6
DT | 6 | 20 | 8
FF | 8 | 14 | 3
LT | 13 | 9 | 0
CR | 6 | 6 | 0
CE | 3 | 2 | 0
DE | 6 | 16 | 0
TOA | 3 | 10 | 17
LAVA | 11 | 24 | 33


So uh, not a single Vermin, Luminous or PB Roshan in the first 12 pages. 1 EF, 1 BA, 1 SE, 3 FB, 3 SF, 4 RE. Also only around three of the total of DT and FF ones had color codes, the rest were tagged.

Now you could say ""but the EF owners don't bother trading them in lounge, they go to reddit or other more reliable sites"". Well, that doesn't apply to Vermin and Luminous ones does it? Also the amount of EF Moroks is pretty high, there's more EF than PB or LG ones.

To me it seems they have the exact same drop rates on every single effect, which would mean only a *handful* of legendary couriers with specific-effects coming from the Wax crate exist. I don't think it's even possible to make a collection of, let's say, BA Roshans with all colors. 

So yeah.. just doing this since people seem to think EF is expensive because it's rare, not because it looks better. 


EDIT: before EF courier owners start crying and downvoting, I am NOT saying they should be any less valuable at all. All I'm saying is they're where they are because they look good, but there's as many EF as AoV crappy ones in existence.",,False,,t5_2t22d,1374741186.0,,,True,t3_1j0b25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1j0b25/q_is_ef_really_rare_as_everyone_says/,

Dota 2 Legacypedia is a homepage about Legacy Couriers launched by G_ary (http://www.reddit.com/user/The_Argo/) and me. We are not any pricelist price-checking or trading page. This page provides the biggest Legacy Database available, looking ahead to store screenshots &amp; information of all Legacies out there. However: For now we rounded the RGB codes to prevent you from Google-ing the legacies to get to their owner profiles. This MIGHT be just temporary, we are still thinking, but we want to provide 100% privacy and security to the owners. Use it to check if any similar legacies of yours exist? No problem. You can use this link as an example when you want to compare legacy RE stumpies (or sell your own).


http://www.d2lp.com/database/?defindex_d[]=10017&amp;particle_d[]=16&amp;sort_d=defindex  

Another use is using the screenshots for your trades: Example: 

http://www.d2lp.com/courier/?entry=594  

------------------------

We also have a color tutorial explaining you everything about the world of Legacy Couriers. We are looking ahead to receive as many information about legacies as you have. Just crawl our page.  

Since the site is still in a beta-like status, many pages are unfinished. For now: Please e-mail us all suggestions you come up, may it be homepage style or functional. Do not hesitate! We don't bite. Also visit our IRC channel!

Work in progress features:  
- You can contact us to be listed as an owner of the legacy / remove rounding
- Color Wheel to search for legacies  
- Connections to LuckynumberSven's Courier Archive project

Notes

The Leshrac Thorns Of Sundering Set doesnt show up in the Bundles tab but does show in the Equipment tag, another error in coding probably.

I dont see Shagbark anywhere, must be some issues with coding or something.

Lycan Items seem to be crashing the game, so try not to use them till a hotfix arrives (Hard i know!!!)

Ive listed Maximilian the Beetlebear as a Genuine courier because it has a 'Games Viewed' tag and is coded the same way as Wynchell Grillhound and Inky (Im assuming its going to be changed to Genuine soon, if it does not i will remove the tag)

The TPL Queen of Pain set is currently working ingame as intended.  At 15 views it gains a reddish blood/aura thing, at 30 views the items change to the second form. At 45 views feathers start to drop from the wings and at 60 views (Full) the set changes to its last form.  TPL have mentioned that you will be able to customise the look so you can keep the auras and go backward in visual, but this is not coded yet.

If there are broken links etc, holla at me!

Basically, I had a Piercing Beams Wardog, and I'm told it had a ""Legacy"" coloring, which is apparently very valuable. Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of this (I've never really traded with anyone other than real-life friends), and Dota 2 Prices told me that the courier was worth 6 or so keys, which I'm guessing is the price for non-Legacy War Dogs.


I traded the courier for a black Divine Essence War Dog, and a copy of the game Sleeping Dogs. The trader obviously knew what he was doing, as he gave me a two-out-of-three choice between the two items mentioned above and a max-effect Wyrmelon, which led me to believe that the courier's value was equal to only two of those. I thought I was getting a pretty good deal, but I was obviously wrong.
A Redditor alerted me to the fact that my courier was being sold on this subreddit for approximately $500 on [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1cy0yo/h_jazzberry_jam_pb_wardog_w_offers/), as he investigated the owner of the War Dog and found that it was me.


So, I didn't get ""scammed"" per se, but I did get completely ripped off, and I'd like to know if there's anything in the trading community (maybe involving reputation?) that would allow me to try to get my War Dog back. Obviously, this is a long shot, and it's my fault for not knowing the value of the item, but clearly the trader knew the courier's true value and was trying to rip me off.


Thanks for your help!

I was messaged by someone who was trying to buy my BattleFury, he said he would pay me $105 USD though Paypal. But we would need a middleman to do the trade. He wanted to use his friend hidden strings but I didnt see this guy anywhere on the middle man list so we agreed to use Leon from Dota 2 Traders. So i added him and everything. That was last night. This afternoon he messaged me saying he wanted to do the trade. So I agreed. He sent me a link to add Leon again. So I did. His profile looked exactly like Leon nothing different. And we were going through the trade. 

I gave Leon my BattleFury, and he was suppose to send the money.
He kept saying he was waiting for Leon to give the signal. Then he wanted to do more trading, he wanted to trade for a smeevil. He wanted my No Red Text DOTA 2 Invites, so we agreed on a deal and I gave leon my invites. 

Then this guy I was trading with panicked and said thats not the real Leon. And I knew I was fucked. Basically he said it was my fault logged off and I didn't get my money. Then I checked fake Leon's profile and it was Hidden Strings. I really got robbed and scammed. 

What do i do?

I have all conversations and even a video of the trade going through and all their steam profiles.

never do trades with Mr. Luckybunny

##FAQ

**Q:)** I’m actually looking to get keys rather than give keys are you interested in trading?

**A:)** Yes I do have a list down below that lists the items I will trade keys or store credit for and the price I will give.  I will also buy multiple items as well at that price.




**Q:)** Why do prices change so much?

**A:)** It’s just the way of the economy some items become more rare in time where others become less rare and lose value.  Also keys change in price based on the amount of them in circulation sadly those scammers out there drive down the worth of items.




**Q:)** How many modifiers can you have on a strange item?

**A:)** You can add 3 modifiers allowing you to have a total of 4 per piece, Original track info of the item plus 3 of your choosing.

 ----
 

##Disclaimer

All prices in this store is my opinion of the item based on economy and ways I feel the items will turn at the time of the update.  The prices here no way suggest this is what an item is worth. I don’t value keys at the standard store price of $2.50 and the price varies day to day.  You can find what I value the keys at in the payment section and its what I use to price the various items. Also any suggestions or constructive cretinism is welcome.


-Prices of the store change from day to day or hour to hour depends on how the economy changes please check back at the store for up to date prices.



-The format of this store was inspired by Div you can find his store [here!](http://redd.it/101fv2)

##Payment Methods:

I mainly trade for keys however to satisfy everyone I use multiple ways to trade with everyone.  If you don’t have Keys for trade then I do accept steam Paypal. However you send first and If I feel any suspicious activity from you I will require a middleman, this only applys to paypal though. For cash trades I do them at the following rates.

**Conversions:**

**PayPal** ($1.70) 1 key

 

If you don’t have keys and don’t want to use money I do trade for items for either keys or store credit whichever you prefer is fine.

 ----

##Need Keys? or Want Store Credit?

These are a list of items I'm currently looking for and will trade for multiples of each till I remove them from the list.

Go to_ ___Whats New___ _to skip the phishing site details._

***

## Phishing Sites

as many of us know already, there are a few sites posing themselves as steam website.

__Examples:__

+ http://imgur.com/a/iqLWj
+ http://i.imgur.com/GwaTEjm.png



__How Phishing works__

1. When you enter your id and password on the __phishing site__, it has a __automated bot__ that tries the id and password on actual Steam website and Steam assumes that you are trying to log in from a new location (computer / browser).
2. Steam Guard issues a code and sends to your email and prompts the __bot__ for the code. When the prompt is issued to the __bot__, the __phishing site__ also issues the same prompt and asks you for the code. All of the above happens in an instant.
3. If you enter the code sent to you by Steam Guard on the __phishing site__, the code is sent to the __bot__ who then uses the code to gain instant access to your account ___and your account becomes compromised___.

***
## Whats New

1. The scammers are now using these compromised accounts and posting the phishing links to their friends. 
2. That is not all, they are asking the friends to let them use expensive items.

***
## TODO

__How to Prevent__

1. ___Do not enter your Steam credintials on given links___ (even if it was given by your best friend). If you must log in from your browser, always check for __url authentication__ (as shown here: http://i.imgur.com/RbW2tGc.png)
2. If your best friend asks you for a expensive item to use, ___verify that it is the actual person___ (eg: ask him if he remembers your middle name / phone number).
3. Spread the awareness.



__Report the Phishing Site__

+ fill out the from and report it to google: http://www.google.com/safebrowsing/report_phish/


__If Account is Compromised__

+ Contact Steam Support Immidiately: https://support.steampowered.com/
 + Explain everything, Provide necessary screenshots.

1361879781.0,16,self.Dota2Trade,1996vk,[PSA] How to solve Replay Download Error,ZantetXuken,19,3,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1996vk/psa_how_to_solve_replay_download_error/,"I posted this on r/dota2. I repost this here just in case someone need it and still hasn't read.

For people having trouble with downloading replays (Error 206/0...)

I have a proper solution for this, all we need from Valve is the download link, the replay downloader in-game is suck!

We have to open Console to show the link (you can jump to 3. if you can show the Console already)

**1 .** Open Steam Library &gt; right click Dota 2 &gt; choose Properties &gt; choose Launch Option &gt; type in ""-console""

**2 .** Launch Dota 2, you should see the Console, you can show/hide it by typing ""`"" (by default)

**3 .** Now go download a replay.

**4 .** Error occurs, but we dont have to wait to see any Notification. Just when the Download bar jump back to previous progress, eg: 3% -&gt; 2%, open the Console now and you will see something like this in the latest lines:

""http://replay122.valve.net/570/136061218_1841428825.dem.bz2""

**5 .** Copy that link and paste it to web browser such as Chrome/Firefox, or even better is paste it in Download Manager like IDM.

Ok we download that replay really fast and smooth, and now how to use it.

**6 .** Extract that archive bz2 file. Cut off the name of that .dem file from ""_"" to the end.

eg: 136061218_1841428825.dem -&gt; 136061218.dem

**7 .** Put it in ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\replays"" (window 7 and xp, should be the same on window 8)

**8 .** We are all set, launch Dota 2 and enjoy your replay! :D

**#Note:** To disable the annoying Console always show whenever you launch Dota 2, you can remove the ""-console"" in Launch option, and do like this (since this way is a bit more complicated and slower, so that I write it down here)

**1a .** Create new file named ""autoexec.cfg"" in ""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\dota\cfg""

or Open it if you created it already.

**2a .** type in ""con_enable 1"". Save and close the file.

Hope all this can help you enjoy your replay!",,False,,t5_2t22d,1361900909.0,,default,True,t3_1996vk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/1996vk/psa_how_to_solve_replay_download_error/,

Huge pack purchase! Tons of stuff available for sale. Stop by for all your small and not-so-small needs! Previous thread located [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/17d4wl/store_the_walmart_of_dota_2_trading_restocked/).

I'll try to update this as frequently as possible. There's a lot of random stuff in my backpack that I'd like to convert into keys, so check here. All prices are in keys; be prepared to overpay if you want to pay in items. The exception goes for items I list in my want list. I have no preference for keys (meaning new and old keys are valued the same).

If you want to break up a set, you'll need to pay more since I will have to expend effort to replace the missing piece.

Add me from [here] (http://steamcommunity.com/id/flamewheel) if you want to discuss. My public backpack is available for perusal [here] (http://tf2b.com/dota/flamewheel). The secondary backpack is [here] (http://tf2b.com/dota/76561198057754885).

&gt;""I got first prize it works! going to lose all my commons this way"" - [finalfallout3](http://www.reddit.com/user/finalfallout3)

•

Hi guys, I've spent a lot of time building a Steam bot that allows people to gamble items they don't want. This is just a fun project for fellow gambling addicts like myself. The program is stable and ready for public testing. However, errors will likely occur anyway. Because of this, I am only accepting commons as currency until I can be 100% sure there won't be any problems. EVERYTHING IS LOGGED so don't fret. If something happens just message me and we'll get everything sorted out. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. I have tons of features planned that I hope to add in the coming weeks.

•

**Update:** So far this has been a huge success! Thanks to everyone who tried the bot and for your patience when I had to keep turning it off to fix it! Tomorrow I will be adding an additional chance to win back your ticket as a thank you to all of you guys and gals!

**Update:** You now have a chance to play again if you don't win. This is a thank you to all of the patient people that have helped me fix some frustrating bugs.

•

**Instructions**

    1. Add Bot to friend's list.

    2. Invite to trade (If bot is busy it means it is trading with someone else atm)

    3. Add commons. Accept trade. (You'll receive 1 ticket for each common)

    4. type ""/pl"" or ""/play"" to play a ticket (in steam chat)

    5. ?????????????????

    6. $$$ Profit $$$

•

-- Prize Levels -- (bigger prizes mean smaller chances of winning)

Grand Prize Level: 8 Rares!

First Prize Level: 3 Rares and 1 Uncommon

Second Prize Level: 1 Rare and 3 Uncommons

3rd: 4 Uncommons

4th: 10 Commons

5th: 1 Uncommon and 1 Common

6th: 4 Commons

7th: 3 Commons

8th: 2 Commons

9th: 1 Common

1 Ticket = 1 Common

- Something happened and the courier cards got warped, still viewable i have NO idea what happened.
- Have put 'Polycount Tagged' on the Polycount sets, theyre currently not tagged but they should be.
- There will at some stage tomorrow be a video from dota2.ru showcasing all the polycount sets and frostivus chest items, if you want to see that let me know :)

It's very quick and easy to use.

**1. Make sure your inventory is set to public.**

**2. Add dota2bot1 or dota2bot2 to your friends list. Their names will have the format [AutomatedBot]Dota2 Bot #.**

**3. Initiate a trade with the bot. The bot will send you messages on how to use it. Or see below.**

To use the bot:

Add 4 of a item rarity, then type !tradeup to receive 1 item of 1 level rarity higher. You put in 4 commons, you get 1 uncommon. You put in 4 uncommons, you get 1 rare, etc.

Add 1 item, then type !tradedown to receive 3 items of 1 level rarity lower. You put in 1 uncommon, you receive 3 commons. You put in 1 rare, you receive 3 uncommons, etc.

Some things to keep in mind:

The bots are very busy. I am working on adding more.

The bots have a timer, you cannot take more than 360 seconds before it will cancel the trade.

The bots have an idle timer, if you don't take an action within 60 seconds, it will cancel.

If no one will !tradedown, then, eventually no one can !tradeup. I have dumped all my items of higher rarity in the bots inventory, once they are gone, that's it, until people add more. So help keep these bots going.

**You CAN'T trade essences, keys, chests, or anything that ISN'T equipment.**

The bot has pseudo-random item giving. If you put an item in, and don't like what it gives, you can't take it out, and place another item in. The order of items is determined when the bot loads. It will trade items in that order, until the item is off the list, then it will change the item.

If you have any issues, add COFFMAN34. **DO NOT add COFFMAN34 attempting to trade with the bot**, that is my main steam account.

You can now trade multiple items, as well as multiple rarities. You CANNOT mix !tradeup or !tradedown.

**So, if you see the bots offline, try to add them again.** Their friends list were getting rather full also. So I have had to make it so that it removes a user after trading from it's friends list. You will have to add them to your friends list again to trade again. I will also be working on a solution for the friends list.

We now have a Steam Group Page. I will be moving over all discussions to it, to keep the trade sub from filling up. All important messages will be relayed on it now.

http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dota2Bot

**NO MORE DUPES** The bots will no longer add dupe items into the trade. Rest assured you won't get 3 Staff O'Wicked Baddness'.

**Bonus items are here!!** Some of you may have noticed an out of place item on the bots, the Greevils. These are the initial bonus items. They were donated by another Steam user and bonus items have been implemented.

You may be wondering, how can you get your hands on one of these awesome bonus items? Well, it's simple, all you have to do is !tradedown a rare, or 3. Each rare that you !tradedown will give you a chance to get the item.

One thing, if you are the big winner, **DO NOT** do anything to the trade after it is added, just re-accept the trade. If you do, then the bonus item will be removed. I will not give the bonus item back to you.",,True,,t5_2t22d,1355361202.0,,default,True,t3_14p5iz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/14p5iz/store_the_first_ever_random_item_bot_improved/,

*Few notes about strange items:*

- The default modifier for 99% of strange items from chests is ""Kills"" There are a couple of exceptions to this:

1. Furion's Horns Of The Forest Lord tracks Trees Created

2. Furion's Doubly Braided Beard tracks Victories

3. Furion's Grand Crown Of The Gigas tracks Victories

4. Furion's Runed Ailettes track Towers Destroyed

5. Juggernaut's Wolf Cape Of The High Plains tracks Victories

6. Juggernaut's Kimono Of The Ebony Tower tracks Victories

7. Juggernaut's Omnishred The Defiant tracks Omnislash Jumps

- Maximum Strange Modifiers per item is 4, if you use another one on a maxed item, you'll get an error message.

- Ranks are only given for the Primary Strange Statistic (Kills/Victories/Trees Created/Omnislash Jumps)

- Stats are only recorded in Matchmaking games.

- Strange Equipment can only be obtained from a treasure chest, and will have an Orange border in your backpack.

- If you trade an item with stats already recorded on it, they will be reset.

- Juggernaut's Prey-Tracker's Aspect Mask is the only item (So far) to appear in two different series of chests (Series #1 and #3)

I will attempt to change the format each time, so any ideas for new and interesting giveaways are welcome.  
For Science!*

~~THE UPVOTE RUSH~~ **KING OF THE HILL:**

This raffle will work like this:

* Post comments below.

* Upvote interesting comments within this thread

* In 4 hours (3pm PST) I will give a rare Description Tag tool to the person who has received the highest upvote ratio.

Have at it, and for god's sakes don't add me!

**EDIT:** Well it's been one hour, and so far it looks like the leader is -470-, who is using the ""hijack OP's raffle"" tactic to great success.  Also renamed raffle.

**EDIT:** Been 2 hours, -470- is crushing the opposition. 

**EDIT:** One hour left! Thanks everyone for your comments, A for effort!  Truth be told I have been a little disappointed by the creativity, but what can I expect from a bunch of basement-dwelling mouth-breathers amirite?

**EDIT: THE RAFFLE IS OVER!**

Congratulations to the winner, [-470-](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013841727/), who took an early lead that only grew wider for 3.5 hours straight.

**A FEW NOTES:**

* For the sake of science (need better control group) I will not be allowing the use of formatting in future auctions.  While I'm sure 470's comment would have won regardless, how quickly and the degree to which he won is clouded by the use of bold text.

* I will be looking forward to participating in 470's raffle; if I win that one there is a possibility this subreddit could implode on itself, which could be cool (for science obviously).

* The winning tactic seems a little too close to breaking raffle rules.  You are not allowed to create a raffle in which participants give up items for the chance to win something.  While items didn't explicitly determine the outcome of this raffle, it turns out that the hive will always upvote free stuff, and therefore the participant who gave up the most loot ended up winning.  In a King of the Hill style upvote battle, I'm pretty sure this tactic will always win, so in future raffles this will not be allowed, once again for science.

* If this tactic were allowed with the note that all future raffles also had to be King of the Hill (as opposed to -470-'s random raffle, which of course mouth-breathers prefer because ezmode), there could be a never ending snowball prize that could mathematically speaking be worth over a million USD!

* *To everyone who cries down their face about the ""exploiters"" who won unusual golden roshes, or if you think my heckling of -470- means I don't like his tactic: he was the only person in this thread who really thought about how to win, instead of just saying something cute.  While his tactic ruins the intent of the thread (generating lots of cuteness, for science), and while the golden rosh tactics are cheesy too, PEOPLE SHOULD NOT BE SHAT ON FOR THINKING OUTSIDE THE BOX AND EXPLOITING LOOPHOLES.  You commend them and close the loophole, for science.*

~~**You pay me up front in keys for the item,** I will place the order, and once I receive the codes I will give you your item.~~

~~**If you want just the cosmetic item**~~

~~[Zonkey Courier](http://store.valvesoftware.com/product.php?i=ADT003) = 13 keys~~

~~[Bow of Howling Winds](http://store.valvesoftware.com/product.php?i=CJ009) = 13 keys~~

~~[Recluse Reef Denizen](http://store.valvesoftware.com/product.php?i=CJ017) = 13 keys~~

~~[Wyvernguard Edge](http://store.valvesoftware.com/product.php?i=CJ001) = 13 keys~~

~~[Shitty Wizard Courier](http://store.valvesoftware.com/product.php?i=CJ006) = 15 keys~~

~~[Kantusa The Script Sword](http://store.valvesoftware.com/product.php?i=EDT001) = 33 keys~~

~~I've been seeing a lot of these people selling stuff like Drow bow for 17+ keys and the script sword for 35-40 keys, so if you want it for a low, set-in-stone price, now is your chance. Also, the mouse says it is limited edition, which makes me think that there is a limited amount of kantusa swords that will ever be created (just my speculation though).~~

~~**If you want the item and the merchandise**~~

~~If you want the item and the merchandise and you're buying from me, I assume you want to buy it from me because Valve shipping is insane to your country (price-wise and time-wise). USPS will ship a small box that can fit 2 medium shirts to most places in the world for $17. They can do a large box (which is big enough for about 2 plushes and 5-6 shirts) for $60. I'd also like a small tip of a few keys if I'm doing the work to ship to you, we can discuss this.~~

~~**FAQ**~~

~~**WHY are you even offering this? I'm afraid to be scammed.** ~~

~~Some people don't have access to Paypal, some people just have keys, and some people just want the cosmetic items without paying a ton for shipping and then waiting (or Valve won't even ship to them in the first place). I've had a lot of people ask about my shirt items, so while I'm not willing to sell my own copies, this is your chance to get these items for set-in-stone prices without paying for shipping (or at least Valve's shipping). Like I said, I was ordering from the shop for myself, so I'm throwing this out there for anyone who wants to join in and order these items for a set price since there aren't really on the market at the moment.~~

~~**Will you be doing this again?**~~

~~After this, probably not. It's possible but these things are a lot of work for me, we'll see though.~~

~~**When will you be ordering?**~~

~~This Monday, September 17, around 6 PM MST.~~

~~**Can I give you items for this stuff?**~~

~~Keys only, sorry. I'm doing this a few days ahead of time so sell some stuff for keys if you want now.~~

~~**Can I get a discount if I order multiple things?**~~

~~The pre-order prices are already me breaking even pretty much. I can't go any lower than these, sorry.~~

~~**Some Screenshots**~~

Sorry folks, was away at The International 3 enjoying the highlife for a week, i preferred to watch games instead of play Line Simulator 2013 (TBH i think autographs in general were handled poorly) Shouldnt have to juggle between watching premiere games or sit in a line for 2 1/2 hours to get some digital items.

Feel free to hit me up with any questions etc or if i broke a link, missed info etc.

Shoutout to the Dota 2 Brazilian Community who are starting to translate my work into Portugese!

**Careful when purchasing TI3 couriers due to the recent unusual change, if they dont have the colour code 0,0,15 they are not fully 'Unusual' (Meaning they wont have the Green TI3 Swirly bits).**

Here you have the chance to grab one of the best and famous tournament sets out there in dota2 so far.

I am looking to cashout all my inventory and thats why i place it here.

There will be no quicksells but i decided to take / note offers now for all sets individually. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the non set parts you may offer for every single piece.
--------------------------
Nontheless I am still looking for any decent offers for the whole bundle.

I am expecting to note offers only when they are valid at least some days.

If there are any questions concerning particular items etc. feel free to add and ask me.

I am trying to give as much information about these tournament item i can provide.

Just to point it out here at some point my items will not have the best tags but i myself decided to collect most of the items to the value of their first drop.

I will mark those numbers red where the items are at a very very high chance first of a kind drops.

When it comes to the tournament items everyone knows in the end there will be a huge amount of each item and several ones with very good tags.

But keep in mind only one counting as a first drop though. Here you got some of them with the earliest ids you can find.

There is no 100% confirmation about the first of a kind drop but iam long enough and from the beginning in the 

scene to know almost every juggernaut item drop back in 2012.

**2. Tournament immortal Drodo courier with Grand Finals Tag.**

read this!  

There are only 3 high valuable based on kills aspect tournament GF couriers with triple kills.   
The first one - Ferrari 3ple kill 1st game on Lanaya, probably lockjaw. **owned by illusion-maker.**    
The second one - my courier, Zhou 3ple kill 3rd game on Lone Druid, kills went from XBOCT through Dendi to Puppey, final battle of the game with a score of 20-2 in IG favor, drodo courier.   
The 3rd one - Zhou 3ple kill on Naga Siren in a last one game, that is a lockjaw and i saw it only once.   

There are no couriers higher then 3ple kills from finals (no ultra).   
Im not sure you can find 1st one courier or 3rd one courier, so probably my courier is the only aviable 3ple kill by active champions carrier Zhou and only aviable 3ple kill courier from finals.   
If you can find 2 another 3ple kills, i will fix my thread for sure, not a huge problem.   

I didnt mind to sell this courier, but few guys suddenly came to me and we got a conversation about it.   
So i decided to provide my favorite courier and take few offers, if i will find an offer i cant resure=insta trade.   
I do not accept paypal, normal things.   
immortal stuff, d2wardogs only.

**Offers:**  
**1. D2W+drodo by 信仰  ~1390 USD**     
**2. 1400 USD by aristar**    
**3. D2W+smeevil by illusion-maker.  ~1620 USD**  
**4. Alphine set+2 smeevils+lockjaw+bf by i make originals. ~ 970 keys=1746 USD.**     

Got a lot of another offers, but im too lazy to confirm em and if i cant confirm=cant post here.  
- - -   

**Here is no B/O.**     
If you want to take it with your hands, you have to pay enough and fair due to the rarity of my thingy.   
If i wont find any nice one offer, dats okies, i will wait next 6 month as i did before.   


**Feel free to add me into steam if you wanna take a look or discuss anything you like with me, not a problem, im pretty outgoing.**

If this initiative will receive positive feedback by most of you a New Rule will be added on this SubReddit, that is to ""Enforce a BO and/or the Auction format with Reserve Price on any Legacy Courier sale"" from now on. The reasons behind this are simple afterall, everyone has witnessed at least a few times so far that the sales of the Legacy Curiers are always troubled by uncertainties and mostly no clues of the sellers expectations, leaving the bidders in a stalemate with their assets frozen for weeks, or, worst-case scenario, months. As we all know this market is still in an early stage of development considering that we are all gambling on a game that regardless of its prospectives of success it's still in a Beta phase. Prices change almost every day and making a good investment today could even pay tomorrow, plus the vast majority of traders can not afford to sit forever on what might represent the totality of their finances in the fading hope to get ""maybe someday"" the object of their desires. As Legacy owner, Buyer and who knows, probably future seller I strongly support this new rule proposal, I know that many of you will say ""Legacy curiers can't be cataloged in common price lists for their uniqueness"", but so many of them have already been sold that the price ranges for most colors and effects are pretty much known, and with a little bit of effort and trasparence by the sellers today we can break a huge wall that has been a cancer for this awesome world that is the Dota2 Trading Comunity. Said so, I would like to thank you again for reading all this wall of text, do not forget to start your comments with a: ""YES/NO"" , followed by your personal opinions if you have any, as the results will be counted for the approval of the rule itself.",,False,,t5_2t22d,1361930857.0,,default,True,t3_19asbk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/19asbk/idea_open_pool_to_the_whole_comunity_enforce_a_bo/,

****************************************************

Welcome, __Dear Visitor__.

Our store offers the rare and mythical items for you. We try to provide low prices and excellent service and hope that you will happy with us.

**Basic Rules**

* **Сurrency** All prices are in the keys. It is the main currency of Dota2 society.
* **Prices** You can see fractional prices like ""0.6 key"". It means that u can buy some items for 1 key. For example, if u want to buy Trident of the Sea Stalker (0.6 key) and Crimson Wyvern Helm (0.4 key) u need to pay only 1 key for the both.
* **Discount** If the summary cost of the wanted items is fractional, we can give 8% discount for You. So if u want to buy items for 3.1 or 3.2 keys u can paid only 3 keys for it. The upper limit of this discount is 0.5 keys.
* **Lucky Seven** If u buy items for 6 keys, u can take items for a 1 additional key for **Free**! Unfortunatelly this action doesn't work with New Polycount Sets.

1349355769.0,16,self.Dota2Trade,10xm1o,[PSA] Alpine Stalker PANICS,irish_00,18,2,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/10xm1o/psa_alpine_stalker_panics/,"I hate provocation and seriously [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dota2Trade/comments/10xbge/psa_looks_like_apline_stalker_set_is_returning/) is making me quite mad. This simply cannot be even an announcement because it is showing the situation in shady details.

I'd like to point out few things from the [dotaholic](http://dotaholic.com/dota-2/patch-notes/patch/177.00) research.

(!) Facts:

* Alpine was not **added** to the latest patch.
* Alpine is mentioned in the **Changes** tab.
* The only mentioned change about the set is that is was renamed from ""The Alpine Stalker **Bundle**"" to ""The Alpine Stalker's **Set**"".
* Among with Alpine **non-sold** ""Wicked Bad Vodooo **Bundle**"" was renamed to ""Wicked Bad Voodoo **Set**"".
* And at the same time Hammer of Hope is now part of the The Hierophant's Protection **Bundle**.


(!) Considerations:

* IMHO if name was changed from the **bundle** to **set** that can definitely mean that is is **not going to be sold**. Bundle - is something u can get discount with, tho set - is just a collectible parts. The Hierophant's Protection Bundle is the example in this case.
* So inevitable conclusion from here is that set can be added as **drop only** or stay in the **ghost state** as it is now, but probably even acquire some attention from Valve (vintage label or something). Still, outstanding labeling may cause some indignation because some ppl were unable to buy it on time. But seriously guys, set don't fit the game and dota is still beta - why can't this set just stay there as some fun development relic? ;P
* And yes, I admit that there is always a chance of adding it back, but, please, think a bit before going crazy.

What this means is that most of the SteamRep middlemen (myself included) will be taking an indefinite break from providing our services to the community. This is until we can find a solution that pleases Valve in some fashion and protects our accounts from lockdown.

The implications of this are simple and clear: 

**Conducting cash sales will be much riskier without the use of a middleman.**

I can't guarantee that all SR+ middlemen will be ceasing their services, so you are welcome to try adding anyone that doesn't have anything on their profile to indicate they have quit. However, I, as well as a number of other community admins, will be bowing out.

I encourage everyone to be as safe as possible when trading, buying, and selling. As you're undoubtedly aware, scammers are everywhere, even in our dear subreddit. Take every precaution you can. Here are some tips on how to tell if someone is trustworthy:

1. How old is their Steam account? If it's several years old, that's usually a good sign. Scammers often have brand new or very young accounts.

2. Do they have many games? If the account has a few F2P games loaded up, but no retail titles, then it's probably unsafe. If the other user has a bunch of games purchased, it is probably safer than otherwise.

3. Do they have a reputation thread on SourceOP.com? SourceOP is the birthplace of the TF2 trading community. Rep threads are hosted there to keep track of cash transactions. If the other user has more than one or two pages of rep from a variety of users, then that is a good sign. However, *always double-check the profile linked on the rep thread with the one you're talking to!*

4. If they are putting a lot of pressure on you to complete the trade and you're unsure, it's probably best to just walk away. Don't do anything you're uncomfortable with.

TF2 has firmly established prices with the items. These prices are listed by player voted spreadsheets such as:

* [Backpack Explorer](http://backpack.tf/pricelist)
* [TF2 Spreadsheet](http://tf2spreadsheet.blogspot.co.nz/)

Educate yourself on prices to ensure that trades between games are fair- as of now, many traders are taking advantage of the fact that the Dota trading scene is still new and making unfair trades to unwary Dota players. 

If cash is changing hands through paypal, be sure to check [Steamrep](http://steamrep.com/). This website is used to report and mark activity which has been deemed to be scamming or fraudulent. It's very easy to get scammed out of items, and a quick Steamrep search can save your items from being stolen.
