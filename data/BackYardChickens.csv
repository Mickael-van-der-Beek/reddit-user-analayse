1367418802.0,93,self.BackYardChickens,1dhdqs,Please consider raising heirloom chicken breeds instead of the poultry equivalent of Monsanto seeds.,excretacompleta,122,29,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1dhdqs/please_consider_raising_heirloom_chicken_breeds/,"I see a number of posts in this excellent subreddit in which folks are raising modern commercial hybrid chicken strains like Golden Comets, Red Stars, and Black Stars.  These birds are produced by the millions in large commercial hatcheries, and the chicks you buy are the product of a corporation crossing different chicken breeds using a proprietary method that is unavailable to the average backyard chicken hobbyist.  They are, in effect, the poultry equivalent of Monsanto seeds.  If you want to own the next generation of Golden Comets you will not be able to breed them with the Golden Comets you purchased this year.  You will need to go back the commercial hatchery and buy some of their chicks.  And when you do, you will be giving your financial support to an industrial agricultural system that is responsible for destroying dozens of heirloom chicken breeds that have existed for hundreds and sometimes thousands of years.

Why should you care?  Setting aside the notion that our livestock heritage is worth saving because it represents a hugely important component of our history as a species, the practical implication of failing to preserve the genetic gifts that have been developed over centuries in chicken breeds is that essentially squandering our ability to adapt our food supply to future environmental change.  Modern chicken hybrids are bred to flourish in an energy-intensive controlled environment; giant metal climate controlled buildings that wring every last ounce of productivity out of a chicken, often at the expense of eliminating any quality of life for the birds.  By contrast, the staggering array of heirloom chicken breeds were bred to adapt to any number of environmental pressures --extreme cold, extreme heat, predators-- and they are extraordinarily adept at surviving in a hostile, often free-range world.  They also provide superior-tasting meat and eggs.  

A recent study shows that 94% of all heirloom vegetable varieties in America became extinct.  They did so because hybrid vegetables in the 1940s and then genetically modified vegetables in the 1990s offered a more productive alternative to farmers under, again, narrowly limited environmental conditions.  The relentless marketing of these modern seeds and the aggressive corporate tactics used to crush farmers who resisted them have all but eviscerated our ability to produce in large quantities better-tasting food using fewer synthetic products like herbicides and pesticides.  This is lamentably short-sighted.

Potentially every Redditor who keeps chickens can play a role as a 'seed saver;' keeping a small flock of heirloom breed chickens that are simultaneously a key part of our agricultural past and an important part of the future that our children may one day enjoy.  When selecting chicken breeds for your backyard, it's worth considering the difference between the commercial hybrids and the heirloom breeds.

**Chicken wire is for keeping chickens in, NOT for keeping predators out**  
Many predators can easily rip or bite through chicken wire, which means your flock is at risk if you don't buff up security. To test this for yourself, go stick your fingers through some chicken wire and try to enlarge the holes- see how there's not really that much resistance?  
  
The best way to reinforce your run and any windows on the coop is with welded wire or hardware cloth. This is a smaller gauge hole that is welded, not twisted, together, so it's near impossible to get through. It *is* more expensive, so if cost is an issue, only use it on the lower portion of the structure.  
I'd also *highly* recommend adding an apron of hardware cloth (some bent to lay flush to the ground going out 6+ inches) to prevent digging predators, or burying a few inches.  
  
There's nothing sadder than finding out after the fact you could've prevented a raid on your henhouse, so be proactive and beef up your security! ",,False,self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,t3_1bzkgh,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1bzkgh/psa_chicken_wire_wont_save_your_chickens/,

1371319587.0,48,self.BackYardChickens,1gerss,"Alright guys, I’m letting go another one of my weird secrets to raising chickens. How to feed your chicks a high protein diet on the cheap.",valkyrie123,54,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1gerss/alright_guys_im_letting_go_another_one_of_my/,"I have a special pen I built just for raising chicks. It has an eight foot diameter satellite dish for a roof to keep the rain off the chicks and keep predators out. The pen is round, with 2x4 welded wire top to bottom and 6” into the ground. It has chicken wire top to bottom over the welded wire. You don’t need a special pen but the chicks need to be able to shelter somewhere when it rains and the pen better be seriously bullet proof.

Inside this pen hanging from the center about 2 ft from the floor is a standard clamp-on utility light with a 23w LED bulb in it. This is hooked to a timer that turns on about 9pm and turns off at around 5am. The light can be seen all night from quite a distance and that is good.  

Next to the light are the perches. To get closer to the light they must fly to a perch. The first one is about 10"" from the floor and they get higher like a leaning ladder. 

If it is still a bit chilly in the spring I put a white 125W heat lamp in the fixture instead of the LED bulb to help keep the chicks warm. It also kills some of the bugs making them easy pick'ins for the chicks. 


What this light does is attract insects, thousands and millions of insect. With the light the birds can see the insects and after their first taste of one of these yummy delights they will be up all night gorging themselves. Insects are 50-70% protein and a lot of the rest is fat. Feed costs will drop and the birds will get fat and happy. 

Do not do this with your hens or it will disrupt their laying. Make sure the pen is bulletproof as this will also attract predators. If the predators can get in they will. 

We have a porch swing and we love to sit out there at night and watch the chicks running, jumping and trying to fly to catch a bug. The show lasts for hours till everyone is too full to run anymore. The birds get fed, lots of exercise and they learn how to fly and perch. 

EDIT: [HERE](http://s951.photobucket.com/user/valkyrie1234/media/Baby%20Pen%20Light/BabyPen2copy.jpg.html?sort=3&amp;o=0) are the pics of the cage. 

I went out to take video tonight but they are all very tired from the move out of the brooder and there isn't much action yet. An occasional bug would end up in the pen and get devoured in seconds. We have had 1"" of rain in the past 3 weeks and it's starting to look like last summer here with the drought. The bug population is currently very low. I'll keep checking and when the birds settle in and we get some rain I'll get some good video and post it.

They're in my [cotton trailer cage](http://i.imgur.com/b8DoT.jpg). I was given another cotton trailer by a fellow farmer who was cleaning his place up a bit, as he knows I make pens out of them. The new one is 32' long by 8' wide. 

Well, I got it two months ago and had only gotten far enough to take the cage off the trailer and cut enough of a door to weld on hinges. Today, one of my dad's friends who I am planning on raising quail with called and said, ""You want turkeys, right? I'm at someone's house who is selling year-old birds, $25 each. If you want 'em, tell me now.""

I would have gotten more than two, but that's all he had room for in the bed of his truck (he bought four himself). I got a gobbler and a girlfriend for him! The male has a 5"" beard, but his spurs are only .25"" oddly enough. The hen is (supposedly) already laying eggs. I will update you on that soon enough.

I'll post more photos tomorrow when I go to clean the cage up more. Again, I know it's not chickens, but I figured you guys would appreciate it more than anywhere else on Reddit!

P.S., sorry to be so long-winded, I'm just excited!

The duck is in the pen with the turkeys at the moment. They are already doing well together. I am unsure why the bird didn't fly away. Its wing could be broken, but it doesn't look like it. I'm going to keep it until it gets capable of flight again and let it go.

1349876774.0,36,self.BackYardChickens,1191r4,Raising Chickens in Very Cold Climates,valkyrie123,43,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1191r4/raising_chickens_in_very_cold_climates/,"Hi guys it's my cake day so I thought I'd give you a gift. I'm the owner operator of Ice Dragon Farms and we have been raising 1000's of birds for the last 30+ years. Our main line of business is selling hatching eggs. We are located in northern Minnesota so we are very used to cold temps and I thought I'd pass on some of the things we have learned about how to keep your birds alive and healthy during a long cold winter.

1. The perch. This is the most important tip, use it. When building the chicken coop don't use round dowels or 2x2s for the perch. Use a 2x4 with the 4"" flat side facing up. When a chicken perches on a small perch he curls his toes around the perch and the part of the foot under the perch is not protected from the cold. At -30F frostbite can happen very quickly. There is no cure and the affected bird is as good as dead. By placing the flat side of he 2x4 up the bird can sit on it and cover its feet keeping them warm. It will break your heart to watch your prize bird with frozen feet flop around till it is dead. 

2. Heated water bowls will make hauling water in the winter much easier as no where near as much will be needed. The bowls will not be frozen requiring it to be beat on something to get the ice out. Letting the water bowl freeze deprives the birds of water and stresses them, a bad thing in winter. 

3. Protect your birds from drafts. Birds can handle cold, they can't handle drafts. Hang a piece of cloth or rubber over the coop door in the winter to keep the drafts out. The chickens will figure it out soon enough.

4. If you want eggs in the winter put a light with a timer hooked to it to add a few extra hours of 'daylight' to their lives and the will reward you with eggs. I use an LED light bulb ($20) as it uses almost no electricity.

5. If you put a heat lamp in your coop make sure it doesn't get knocked down or burnt out. Heat lamps can easily cause a fire if in contact with straw or wood. Chickens have no regard of your construction abilities and will fly around the coop crashing into things. If the heat lamp goes out on a very cold night and the hens are not used to the cold they might not make it. 

6. For small operations I have heard that putting Vaseline on a roosters comb will keep it from becoming frost bit. I've got way to many chickens to try this so take it with a grain of salt. 

7. When you build your coop put a lot of glass on the south side and use the passive solar heat. Use double pane glass if possible. I find double pane windows at the dump all the time. The birds will love you for this. 

8. Don't scrimp on food in the winter, the birds are having a hard enough time keeping warm, don't stress them. 
   
9. When building your coop put it on high, dry ground. Humidity is a killer when it gets cold. 

10. If you are NPIP certified and use metal leg bands to mark your birds the metal can cause frostbite. Consider removing the bands after testing or switch to plastic bands. 

11. Run electric to every pen. This will allow you to plug in a heated water bowl, a heat lamp, a laying lamp or just a light for you to see what the commotion is all about. 

I'm sure there is a lot more but this will get you on the right track. If you have any questions just ask. 

Edit: is anyone here interested in a Chicken First Aid Kit? I would be happy to make another post and divulge the contents of my kit. I'm a farmer and can't afford vet bills so I have learned how to do it myself. I am not a vet so this is my experience only on how to save money and do it yourself.

Last night my friends from down the road had called to say they had a rooster under their house, and their dogs were both bird dogs. Naturally, I got there at 9pm, it's pitch black and I see this little white bird cowaring under the steps. My fiance had to climb under the house to get him. 

Poor guy cried all the way home, nestled in my arms, head hidden in my armpit. I swore he might of got hurt, but I saw no fractures, bruises, or blood.

I was worried he would be too scared to drink, so I gave him some water via saringe, and offered some blueberries, which were immediately devoured. I placed him in the coop with my hens, and climbed up on the roost with them and went to bed.

This morning, mr rooster is not the head of the pecking order, but it's really great at settling disputes. Someone gets picked on, they run to the rooster and he gets very fluffy.

Today out of curiosity I researched the city limits of my town. Turns out a lot of political bickering has caused the city to have the craziest city limits leaving a lot of land considered unincorporated county land, my house included. I realized that this means I'm not bound by city limits and can have any size flock I want.

Her oviduct was prolapsed pretty badly. I immediately isolated her from the other hens and tried lubing up the end of the egg (which was visible) with a bit of KY and tried to help her for about an hour. When that failed I tried a warm water soak. She relaxed and the prolapse retracted (egg and all) on its own, but she still couldn't lay the egg. After another round of KY and an hour of trying, the prolapse had returned even worse than before.


I probably could have taken her to the vet and they might have been able to break the egg and extract the contents but the reality of it is that this was not an overly large egg and for her to have such a serious prolapse right off the bat in her laying career, the chances were quite high that the problem would only repeat.

So, I did it. And I cried a little bit. But after I plucked and cleaned her, I found another fully formed egg right behind the first, an abdomen with a lot of broken yolk and 13 more yolks - seven of them quite large inside her. I know that some of that is normal but with so much ready to go, I doubt I could have got her to stop laying soon enough and long enough to have given her poor little bum a chance to heal and strengthen up. 


I got these chickens knowing that eventually they would stop laying and they would have to be for the soup pot or I would risk becoming the crazy chicken lady with 30 chickens and no eggs. I think that did make it a little easier - I know it did because it I had thought of them as pets, I would never have been able to do it at all. I don't think the next time will be nearly as hard. At least, I hope.


My brother gave me a bunch of shit because I sold my second rooster rather than do him in. I sent him a text tonight telling him that I am a real farmer now! (A serious exaggeration, but he knew what I meant.)


Anyway, chicken soup tomorrow and hopefully no egg laying drama with the rest of my girls.",,False,self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,t3_zjgmt,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/zjgmt/we_had_to_cull_our_first_chicken_tonight_it_was/,

BTW, juvenile rattlesnakes are venomous, and could have crawled into my shed or somewhere else that would have been inconvenient. In case you are wondering, and I am sure you are, this is in south Texas. 

Last year, I believe we killed 7 rattle snakes within 100 yards of the house, rarely less than 5. This year, with the chickens free ranging, only 3. Not sure this is the explanation, but it is one possible reason. Time will tell, I suppose.

For the record, I am not prone to randomly kill snakes. I have bull snakes, kingsnakes and coachwhips around that we peacefully coexist with, and I wouldn't automatically kill a rattlesnake in the wild. Around the house, is different though.

In this way I can guess the pecking order of my flock. There are no really obvious disagreements among my girls so I thought that finding out who has the best roost might answer the question. This was not to be. I have two coops side by side the four older ladies sleep in one and the new girls take the other. Each coop has two nest boxes and a roost bar. The three older ladies all sleep in one 12x12 nest box. The only reason why Marie isn't in there as well is that as the fattest girl she simply won't fit. She does perch on the back edge of the nest box just above the others. This observation answers my question as to why there is less poop in the coop each morning. Marie poops on the others during the night and they carry it out of the coop in the morning.

The newer girls will only sleep on the roost bar. This bar extends over the entrance and no one will sleep on that part of it. The four girls are sharing about 20"" of space. In addition no one wants to sleep against the wall. They spend a good deal of time jostling one another until someone is pushed off the bar and must take the position closest to the door.

I would love for her to have some chicken friends, but she is still contagious. She is named her after the similarly disabled turkey in South Park that drags its neck along the ground.

There are lots of feral chickens in this area since Katrina. One of my neighbors found one wandering around yelling, mother and the rest of brood are nowhere to be found, so of course they give her to the crazy girl who rescues cats and dogs. I'VE NEVER HAD CHICKENS BEFORE. 

I currently have him/her in a shallow box with paper towel on the bottom and a heating pad underneath, a shallow dish of water (which I introduced it to, and s/he drank like a champ). 

I did some research and saw that a couple people said ground oatmeal (like blended, but not quite to powder) and/or finely-ground cat food (?) will work as an emergency substitute for chick feed. I can't get to a feed store until tomorrow for some Start &amp; Grow. Is this going to be okay? She seems to be eating pretty enthusiastically and is energetic and NOISY.

More Questions:

How often should the chick be pooping? She's pooped 5 or 6 times and I've had her 24 hours.

Will it be a huge serious problem that there's only one? I mean, I don't know what to do about that, I guess I'm just curious.

Please give me any tips you may have and if anyone could please refrain from saying rude, self-righteous shit as redditors have a tendency to do to any novice, I'd really appreciate it.",,False,self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,t3_vgnij,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/vgnij/rescued_tiny_chick_tricky_situation/,

I didn't want any animals because of the maintenance.  Last year I finally relented.  We got four RIR pullet chicks and I fell in love in short order.  
Two days later, we got one buff orp and two golden comets chicks.  

We got two prepackaged coops and joined them together.  They could handle a maximum of ten hens, so we were good.  

I kept reading and learning about different breeds and the desire for more grew.  This year we gave three hens away and lost one, all of the original four RIR.  We got five Americaunas chicks because I *really* want blue eggs and two Barred Rocks.  We are at our max of ten chickens.

My wife said, ""That's it.  No more.""  A month later, we were at a our childrens' field day and caught up with an old acquaintance.  We found out that he also has chickens.  We talked breeds for awhile and he old me he had silkies, among others and a few banties which, according to him are, ""Real good setters.""  I said, ""Let me talk with my wife.""  My wife said, ""Do you think he'd hatch some for us?""  He said he'd throw some Silkie eggs under one of his broody girls and call us when they hatched.  We get our pick of four.

That was just over three weeks ago.  he should be calling any day.

Fourteen chickens?!?  What were we thinking??

Many of you have probably seen my coop progress and stuff throughout the past several weeks. Before I started this fairly large construction project I wrote my city, emailed my city, and went through city ordinances for a couple weeks just to make sure I wasn't doing anything illegal. I couldn't find anything online that had to do with chickens, foul, poultry, or exotic pets. The city didn't call or write back either. So naturally I assumed that I was ok. I should also mention that I live in a small suburb (population around 40k).

Since completing my build, I've picked up 4 hens and a couple chicks (which live inside still). They are all super quiet, keep to themselves and get along well. I've been cleaning and composting their droppings so there really isn't a smell issue. To put it simply, I really love my birds.

Fast forward to yesterday when an animal control officer rang my doorbell to inform me that there are strict ordinances in my town prohibiting backyard chickens and I have 10 days to remove them from my property. Fuck.

Immediately after the officer left, I called the animal control office and spoke to the supervisor of the department. The lady I spoke to was real understanding and polite. I made a point to be super nice. She read to me the ordinance that I'm in violation of. When I asked why my inquiries were all ignored, she couldn't answer and when I sent her proof that I had sent an email, she couldn't explain why I wasn't answered. 

She did however [graciously] extended my deadline to 30 days. She said that there is a city council meeting coming up soon in which the matter of chicken ordinances would specifically be addressed. Apparently this has already been an issue that's being discussed. She told me that I was welcome to come and put in my 2 cents. 

I've spent so much time, money, effort into designing, building, and loving my chickens and their habitat. I hate to throw that all away. I plan on attending that meeting. Is there anything I can do? What can I prepare for that meeting?

Please Help!

She doesn't seem sick at all. Her and the chicks all seem fine.

Since they were going to be locked away and all we have is this little Eglu run, they needed more space.

I used cedar 2x2s to build this, and ordered 50' of hardware cloth from Amazon (free delivery with Prime, and about the same price Home Despot wanted for 25'). All told this run extension cost about $150, which is more than I wanted to spend, but still much less than my wife wanted to spend, and should hopefully last us a good while.

So, our 6 girls are getting close to laying eggs, so they're a lot bigger than they were when we got them at around 2 months old. 

We've got a nice coop for them, with plenty of roosting space, but three of them have taken to jumping/flying up into the rafters of the coop to roost at night. It's not high, maybe 5 or 6 feet from the floor of the coop, but up there, it's a tight space without a lot of room to move. 

I've watched them jump up (quite impressive, really), which is usually followed by some flapping and jockeying for position.

My only concern is that someone's going to break a wing or something, or fall and break a leg.

I imagine chickens are made of rubber, much like young kids, but has anyone ever experienced their girls getting hurt by flapping around in a confined space?",,False,self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,t3_1iex48,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1iex48/will_chickens_hurt_themselves_flapping_around/,

What he meant was, something killed all the babies.

We have adult ladies in one coop, and our latest shipment of thirteen chicks were in another coop. They were about five weeks old. The raccoon tore open the bird netting on the top of their run. The chicks had not been shut into their coop. Pieces of chicks everywhere.

We found one, still alive. I put her inside, in their old brooder, with a hot water bottle and food and water. I hope she makes it through the night and doesn't die of stress or fright. I didn't see any wounds, but she reacts in sheer terror to us. She was screeching and biting me as hard as she could at one point.

I'm just lamenting. My fiancé is asleep. I can't sleep. I feel terrible that I didn't think to shut them in before I went to bed. I'm basically beating myself up over it. I know shit happens, but I am kicking myself in the ass over this. Plus I've got a broken heart. My two favorite girls of the bunch were among the dead. 

If the lone survivor makes it, she'll be joined by ducklings next week. This weekend, I will have a few day-old chicks a relative hatched in an incubator. I think they may be too young and small to put with this one, but the ducklings might be okay.

I rambling now. I'm exhausted and I feel sick to my stomach. I grew up on a farm, so I know what it is to lose animals. But this was so many at once, and so much carnage, and we are responsible for not shutting them in earlier. :(

I live in the PNW and we have hit the major rainy season. My girls are in a permanent 10 x 6 run during the day and free range when I am home to keep an eye on them (I have 3 EE girls). Part of the top, and back of the run is covered by a tarp, to prevent rain and cold from blowing into the coop side of the run. The ladies also have their food protected under there, as well as a perch so they can stay up and dry.

However, the rest of the run is becoming quite the mud pit, and I am concerned that they will get foot issues if we don't do something. I have been adding pine shavings for now to try and absorb some of the wet, but it just continues to get muddy. We are thinking of tarping over the rest of the top of the run to prevent some downpour protection.

Does anyone have any solutions they have come up with (either temporary or permanent) that would help with keeping the girls dry? They stay mostly dry for now, but I am concerned about them getting so muddy and eventually having issues.

I come from a long line of chicken farmers - my great grandparents came to America and started a kosher chicken farm in central NJ in the early 1920s.  In the farm's heyday, they had ~20,000 chickens at any given time!

As the business died down into the late 1980s, my grandfather kept one old coop near the farmhouse operational to house a few dozen chickens, peafowl, and turkeys solely as pets/for eggs.  I grew up (and still live) next door, and have very fond memories of walking over to his house to help feed the birds, collect eggs, and play with baby chicks.  

My grandfather unfortunately passed away years ago.  We maintained his existing bird population, but eventually they all happily lived out their lives and we had no chickens for quite some time.

Until a few years ago!

We were strolling around the yard, when we see a rooster strutting about.  We caught him and temporarily housed him in a large bird cage, and called the neighbors to see if anyone lost him - no takers.  He was a little beat up looking, and his belly was completely shaved, so it's possible people were fighting him.  Anyway, we decided to keep him and set up a small temporary coop in the backyard.  We named him [""The Colonel.""](http://i.imgur.com/SotNH.jpg)

Well, as everyone knows you can't just have *one* chicken!  So we got him two girlfriends: ""Paula"" and ""Swanson.""  We picked up a few Rhode Island Reds, Ameraucanas (they might actually be Easter Eggers?), and some bantams.  We had some [Guinea Fowl](http://i.imgur.com/IUxjg.jpg) for a while, but I couldn't take the noise anymore and they found new homes.

The last few winters and hurricanes took their tole on the original ""coop,"" which was really just a large box I made out of plywood and supposed to be temporary, so we just upgraded to a beautiful 6'x8' built by a local craftsman.  I still need to make them a real outdoor run, but here is the new coop:

...a few moments later, the chain link is shaking like there's a possum inside, but turns out to be 4-5 rats running along its vertical surfaces like a jungle gym. They eventually leap out into the night and are gone.

Problem is, they are eating the chicken food. While the chickens sleep, they schlep past our raccoon and possum-proof chain link and up into the coop... nibble on the food... then are gone by the time the chickens wake in the morning.

This one has me stumped. How do I control the rats? If I let them keep eating (I don't care about the food cost really), their numbers will likely explode in the area causing all sorts of problems.

We've avoided getting a dog, because our chickens free-range in the day and we live in a very urban area so large barking dogs wouldn't fly well. I'm not really sure they would be able to stop these climbing vermin anyway, they never have to touch the ground to get to our run, as there are fences and the like around it.

We already have a cat, and there are already three other neighbor cats around. Clearly they aren't handling it.

What to do? Or should I just chill, shrug, and let the rats eat?

The coop is 4x4x4 and the walls are plywood. I have some general questions about the coop and winter chicken keeping in general.
 
* Should we insulate the coop? If so, how?
* There's not an easy way to run electricity to the yard, so water will likely freeze. How do you keep this from happening?
* Will chickens go outside into their run during the winter, or will they stay, for lack of a better term, cooped up? (Note - our run will have a roof.)
* Do you remove snow in the run, or leave it in there as it drifts/blows around?

General chicken keeping questions:

* Do you have ""chicken"" gear that you wear when handling/mucking out the space? Like rubber boots and a specific coat? How do you wash these items?
* In our city we don't *need* to notify neighbors that we're getting chickens if we live in a single-family dwelling. Do you recommend telling them anyway?
* Our coop/run will need a trench dug around it that we fill with gravel/lava rocks to keep diggers out. What other predator-proofing have you found useful?

Today, I went to open the pen and one hen was sitting near the gate. She squawked at me and was obviously in distress. I opened the gate and two hens and the rooster came out. The hen by the gate came out late. She walked slowly, and she pooped a clearish-substance (maybe an egg broke inside of her?).

This is when it went downhill.  I went to the box where they sleep (a perching area) and found a dead hen. I put her in a bag and disposed of her, but now I'm worried about the other two. I'm grateful that at least 1 hen is acting normally.

The other 2 are walking really slowly and one of them is staying near their water source. They seem to be eating, albeit with not much enthusiasm.

This is the first time i've had chickens since I was a kid. Currently we are using an old shed that I've fixed up for my chickens.

I have no power in the coop and currently no insulation. I got some insulation that I am going to put in the roof for sure but I am unsure about what else I may need to do.

I have considered running an extension cord in to run a heated watering bucket as their water freezes if left overnight. For now I am just going to remove the watering can at night and replace it in the am.

I think I might build one of these [pop can heaters](http://youtu.be/XsF9RvVxFc4) I know it won't help at night but It should help with some heat during the day and keep the water from freezing.


I have 9 hens and one rooster. I still get 4-6 eggs a day (one hen no longer lays due to age) Does anyone have any input on keeping chickens in colder temperatures? Things to do? things to watch out for?

Both times I did not see the attack. The first time, I found my chicken freaked out and hiding under the deck; she could barely walk for days, but eventually healed. Today, I found one of my ducks dead with its throat ripped up :(

We live in town on half an acre, adjacent to a 2 acre field. The birds free range all day, and we have 2 German Shepherds guarding the place, which I have never seen act strangely towards the birds. I could not find even a single drop of blood on either of them after the attack today.

Both attacks happened in the afternoon. I am wondering what predator this is most likely? I am thinking a hawk, just because it's the only thing I can think of that would attack during the day. The birds were full grown on both occasions, so I could not picture a cat doing this, even if it were willing to come into the yard with the Shepherds...

I know I can fence out most predators, but how to defend against hawks without keeping my birds locked in a pen all day? Should I even try, or just resign myself to losing a few birds every year? Is that the price of free ranging? The duck was very beautiful and I'm very sad to see her go. Don't want to lose any more.

Edit: Thanks for the feedback guys. Turns out it was one of the dogs after all - caught him going after the remaining duck this morning.

After doing some reading I came up with some tips to stop this bad habit. One option is to blow the egg out as you would for crafts and fill it with mustard or dish soap. The method I'm trying first is to place some golf balls in the cage. I'm hoping they'll get bored trying to break those open and give up all together on eggs as well. The other options were to curtain off the laying area so they couldn't see the eggs, remover the nesting material so the eggs roll when pecked, or to build a roll away nest box. I also seen where one person with this problem applied peepers (blinders for aggressive poultry) to the egg eaters. Have any of you ever had this problem? If so how did you break it?


Update: Yesterday a tried the golf ball idea and they ate the next egg. I made a roll away nestbox that semi worked.

Can death by feline be prevented/can someone put his fears to rest?  Honestly I'm more worried about the, erm, feral *people* around (or namely, their kids who might vandalize/steal eggs), or crotchety old people who might complain (our city has bylaws that are only enforced if people complain, there are a few backyard flocks around town).  But, there *are* a lot of feral cats as well as outdoor pet cats in the neighbourhood.  The strays tend to travel in a pack too.

I'd only want 3 hens due to space.  We don't have a dog but we do have a cat of our own.

My concern is, I know there are lots of rural folk with chickens and there are a few urban flocks so I know it's not *impossible*, but I'm zone 3 (Canada, north of MN border) and it gets COLD and very snowy here in winter and I just can't wrap my head around keeping them alive all winter.  Most ""how to keep chickens in winter"" guides are in places that don't get as much snow or don't get nearly so cold.  Like, -20C or worse (at times as bad as -40!)  And the winters are very long, snow starts in Sept sometimes and doesn't let up until May.  How is it done?

It was no bother to separate the coops and install a screen partition between the two groups to allow the youngsters to grow enough to hold their own with the ladies.

This morning as I approached the run I saw all the chickens at the door waiting for food. Somehow they had pushed the latch open during the night. Other than separating them I saw no obvious problem other than the youngest Americana got a bit plucked. Then I noticed a line of poop on top of the coop. Given their size it took effort for the youngsters to jump on top like that. It had not occurred to me that they also slept there as well. When I opened the top to clean up I saw eggs in the front corner! My girls are like Sheldon Cooper. The front corner of their coop is the (0,0,0) of their existence.

I just need to know how much time I can expect to dedicate to their care and cleaning out the coop. 

I think I will use sand in the run and hay in the actual coop and nesting boxes. I don't think I will want to do the deep litter method (at least not to start), because I am scared of it getting smelly. I think I will put a plastic mat under the perch in the coop for easy removal and cleaning.

i'm not FOR CERTAIN, it's just that she is acting very abnormally and i have not noticed any of her eggs in the daily gatherings (but i ""ID"" her only by the sheen, her's are typically more shiny- but they are brown like most of my hens- so it's possible she is laying matte now and i just don't know). she stands around the coop instead of foraging,  holds her neck long and up sometimes (but can also be found ducking under the water feeder) and will just stand gazing off into space. i have gone to pet her (which she used to not tolerate for long) and she will become mesmerized and crouch down in place.  she used to be very industrious and a good scratcher- so this is all wrong. she still eats, drinks, and roosts (seemingly) normally. her comb and wattles are not really pale, but might be a little. her vent is clean and there are no signs of external parasites.

how does one diagnose ""egg-bound""- merely the lack of eggs?

i'm not really willing to perform an operation at this point in my chicken career... but should i put her down? at what point? is she in pain?

I know a lot of you are very fond of your chickens. I was just asked what books I have in my library so..... This is a list of the books I have in my library that I use to diagnose what the problem is and what can be done about it. 

**The Chicken Health Handbook  by Gail Damerow**

Pros: A very through book on just about anything that can go wrong with your birds. Well illustrated with pictures and drawings. A 'must have', buy this book. This is your one stop shop for 'what the hell is happening to my babies'. 

Cons: Almost too through. Includes almost everything which can get confusing with all the rare diseases mixed in with the more common and more likely suspects. Some of the testing suggested you cannot do at home without a lab that would attract the attention of the DEA. 

**The Veterinary Guide for Animal Owners   by C. E Spaulding  and Jackie Clay**

Pros: Describes all the common diseases, with causes, symptoms, treatments and prevention. An excellent book to have on the shelf. It covers all common farm livestock including poultry and waterfowl, dogs and cats. Another 'Must Have' on your shelf. Some of you are familiar with Jackie Clay from ['Backwoods Home Magazine'](http://www.backwoodshome.com/). If you aren't you should be, get a prescription, it will make you happy. 

Cons: Not chicken specific. 

**The Merck Veterinary Manual**

Pros: Highly detailed analysis of every animal disease known. Treatments in detail right down to anesthesia used. 

Cons: Way over the layman's head, this is a manual for vets. Most of the equipment you won't have and a lot of the meds you can't get. I have a Biology background so I do understand some of it but a lot is beyond my education. Not something you really need unless you are going commercial.  

**Storey's Guide to Raising Poultry**

Pros: Good general health section, sort of a condensed version of what you will find in 'The Chicken Health Handbook'. Lot of general chicken raising information that is very useful. I would call this a 'Must Have' just for general information contained. 

Cons: Not specifically about Chicken Health.

Where to get books cheap (shameless plug): My first stop for any book is [American Book Exchange](http://www.abebooks.com/) or WWW.ABEBOOKS.COM. Bookmark this site now. Used books at very reasonable prices. If you use the filters you can often find Hard Backs of your favorite books. They will far outlast a paperback. 

Many chicken disease are localized by climate or geography and may never affect you, some are seasonal and this isn't the season. Learn what diseases to watch out for in your area and at what time of year or what weather condition they crop up. This can give you major head start on diagnosis and treatment. Speed is of the essence, unchallenged the problem can/will get worse and fast. 

I hope this post is helpful. If you have any favorites I am not aware of PLEASE POST them. I don't know everything and sometimes I don't think I know anything. Your input is appreciated.

I've kept chickens ever since I graduated college. Now, with moving to a new house and attending grad school, I decided that I had to cut back on what I was doing, and one of the things to go was my flock of hens. 

After I sold them, I felt an unexpected sense of relief, and I just wanted to share. To those just beginning to consider chickens, I urge you to think it through, and do it right. Both for you, and your hens. Most people only focus on the positives when talking about chickens. I now focus on the impact they had on my life, beyond yummy back yard eggs (on a side note, I probably will never buy grocery store eggs ever again). If you get chickens it means:

- Having to find someone to take care of them if you want to leave for more than a day or two. Finding someone you can trust to take care of your animals well, so that you don't come back to a disaster.

- Dealing with the seasonal variance of egg production: prodigious amounts in the summer, and not so much, or any at all, during the winter months. Sometimes even providing a light wasn't enough to keep them laying.

- Worrying about neighbours complaining, your local ordinances, dogs and predators getting your birds, the heat in summer, the cold in winter, poop in the shed, their health, their diet, etc.

- Waking up to the egg laying cackle every.single.morning that they're laying.

- Growing attached to a bird (or multiple birds) that will stop laying enough to pay for her food loooooong before her natural lifespan is up.

I came out to let the girls out this morning, and found my numbers way down.  A rough count puts me at 19 birds lost since yesterday.  8 of these were young birds, about 8 weeks old, contained in a chain-link fence with a chicken wire roof and a closed gate.  The remainder were adults that are housed at night in a coop fortified all around with chicken wire, and no apparent way to get under.  I closed them in last night around 9pm, but did not count them at that time.  All of the above are surrounded by portable electrified poultry netting.

I found no dead birds, nor any mess of feathers.  I found no damage to the coop or the chain link enclosure.  Both were still closed when I came out this morning.  The only thing out of the ordinary that I saw was that a few of the fence posts were laying on the ground instead of upright.  This sometimes happens due to wind, or something else might have pushed them over.

I'm planning to invest in a game camera to help me figure out what's getting the birds.  In the mean time, has anyone else had a similar experience?  Anyone know what kind of critter might have done this?  I don't know very much about predator behaviors, but taking 19 birds away in one day seems unlike what I would expect for most predators, except maybe those with opposable thumbs.

We've had them for a couple of weeks now and they're *less* worried about people now (they were totally freaked out at first) they at least don't mind hanging around near people but they definitely won't run up to us.. They won't eat out of our hands much unless it's meal worms, which they seem to love, and they also pull away if you put your hand out to them, which is a shame!

Also I haven't put mite powder on them yet (the people we got them from said they'd recently been done) and I'm worried that, because they're still worried about people, I might freak them out too much by doing it forcibly, is that something I should be worried about?

One other thing is, just today, I found one of them had dug a little hole in the soil and was sort of burying itself in it, covering itself in soil, I thought something might be wrong with that hen at first but when I checked back it and another one had switched places and the other one was doing exactly the same while the original one seemed fine..

I've got three hens- a Delaware (Blanche), a Buff Brahma (Sophia), and a Brabander (Rose). I got home from a day out yesterday, and when I went to feed the girls, I noticed that Blanche had been attacked and her comb was torn and bleeding. Blood EVERYWHERE. Somehow, also, Rose had gotten out and was wandering the yard. I cleaned up poor Blanche, isolated her with her own food and water, and left them alone the rest of the night.

This morning, when I went to feed/water/check on them, I thought I'd let Blanche out with the other girls. A mistake, as Rose immediately started pecking at her comb. I stuck Blanche back inside and pretty much came in here and posted this. 

I'm unsure of what action to take now. A few things are important, I guess:

1. Blanche has, until today, been the leader of the flock

2. Rose started laying 2 days ago, and is the first of the hens to do so

3. Sophia (the Brahma) is a very, very mellow chicken.

Now, should I think about getting rid of Rose, since she appears to be the attacker? Or should I just keep Blanche isolated for a while until her comb heals before putting them together again?

My backyard is exactly 1 acre. It is surrounded with a chain link fence (4ft) with a iron fence across the front (with hog wire behind that to keep the chihuahua in) The house, a small barn and 3 car garage sit on the same land all at the edges. It is covered with massive oak trees (a couple other species as well, but mostly oak) to the point growing actual grass is impossible. The soil is sand and leaf mulch (I don't bother raking it, I let the leaves break down).


I'm about halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth (to let you know what my summers and winters are like).


I'm building a coop sometime before next spring, and I'll size it accordingly.

We're wanting hens for the following reasons, fresh eggs, fun to watch, fresh eggs, fertilizer from poop, fresh eggs, for the enjoyment of caring for them, and oh yeah, fresh eggs.


My wife is thinking about easter eggers (because the eggs are purdy) are these good in this area? And if so, what breeds would do well with them?


Also, how many? We’re hoping to completely replace store bought eggs for the 3 of us. We are close to vegetarian, (we eat eggs, dairy and fish) so our egg consumption is a little higher than most families of 3. I was thinking 6, am I way off here?

The County Council is considering a bill that would require the Planning Board to study the entire range of livestock restrictions in residential areas, in light of recent changes in numerous other jurisdictions, and make recommendations. The three co-sponsors of this legislation are generally in favor of backyard poultry, and with a seven-person Council, that means only one more vote would be needed to get a much-needed change to the restrictions.

 

This legislation is Resolution 73-13, and can be viewed at the Baltimore County Website.  If the link acts funky, do a search for Resolution 73-13.

http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/countycouncil/legislation/pending%20legislation.html


 

Baltimore County residents can do FOUR things to help make this change a reality:

 

FIRST: Immediately contact your County Council representative, and let them know you support this legislation, because you believe that the current prohibition against backyard poultry is not justified, and would like to see it repealed or revised. Not sure who your Council rep is? Go [here](http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/countycouncilmega.html) and enter your address, then click here to find your rep’s email address and phone number. This is the most important action you can take. Tell them you want to know what their position is, and will expect them to follow up with you based on the outcome of the Planning Board report. Regardless of their position, it will make a big impression on them that you cared enough to take the time to contact them. 

 

SECOND: If possible, come to the Council work session on this bill on Tuesday, August 27, at 2:00 pm, at 400 Washington Ave., Second Floor, in Towson, MD. It would be great to have 5-10 people from across the county speak for 2 or 3 minutes each. But we would also like to have many more supporters just show up, so that when we ask for a show of hands by district, we can demonstrate that there are many supporters. This is early in the process, so we don’t want to look like a bunch of crazies, but do want to show that we are articulate, intelligent, and have broad support. I doubt there are many opponents of the bill who will bother to show up.

 

THIRD: Go to the Facebook page “Change the zoning laws in Baltimore Co. for chickens and small livestock” to stay current on this and related issues.

 

FOURTH: Spread the word – get your neighbors and friends from all parts of Baltimore County to help by taking these four steps themselves.

What we really need is people from other parts of the county where their reps are on the fence – Owings Mills, Pikesville, Reisterstown, Towson, Dundalk, etc.

Anyone have advice?,acdev,8,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1f3clg/broken_beak_problems_anyone_have_advice/,"Woke up to see one of our 10-week-old pullets with a chipped beak at the very tip. It was definitely bleeding. The thing is, it isn't totally broken off. It looks like the top layer was chipped off, leaving a sub-beak exposed. My wife said maybe it's like when you cut a dog's claw too short, you hit the nerve.

We fixed the potential cause of the problem by modifying the coop. I think she may have gotten her beak caught in the hardwire cloth.

I'm wondering if nerves are exposed or something because she can't eat well. She'll pick up the crumble and let it fall. We tried crushing the crumbles and mixing it with water to make a paste. That worked okay, but she wouldn't eat much.

She won't drink too much, either, although she is drinking a little. We have a little syringe that we used to force-feed her a little.

Other than that, she just doesn't seem herself. She's laying down, not foraging or scratching around. 

I'm thinking that she'll be okay in a few days. She might lose some weight. I'm hoping that, as long as we feed her the paste a couple times a day and give her some water, she'll recover.

If anyone has any advice that would be great. Maybe someone out there has experienced a similar problem.

I guess the bottom line is: will she be okay?

###EDIT

I wanted to edit this post with an update for anyone who needs to find this info in the future:

It's been 24 hours since she broke her beak, and she seems to be getting along fine. She can't eat normally, but she can drink. We feed her some crumble paste (just crushed up the crumbles in a blender) with a little bit of [nutri-drench](http://www.bovidr.com/poultry.html) in it. We feed her with a syringe (we just asked at Walgreens - we got one for free). We want to make sure that, even if she can't eat normally, she's getting as much nutrition as possible. 

She isn't lethargic. She's acting pretty normal. Yesterday she was laying around, not running around or scratching. Pretty worrying sight.

If the piece of beak was still around, we'd be able to glue it back, but it was gone.


We also gave her some aspirin to dull the ache. According to what I read, you can give chickens about five aspirin per gallon of water. So I mixed some of that up and gave her a little. It seemed to work okay.


We clean the beak twice to three times a day with saline wash. We also went out and bought [vetericyn](http://vetericyn.com/). Kind of expensive, but you get a lot. We apply the vetericyn after we clean it. 

You can also use neosporin or whatever triple-antibiotic ointment. We bought the vetericyn because its safe for animals and you can use it around the mouth and eyes.

When the rental period is done, everything is picked up.

The primary rental coops will look similar to this, it's still a work in progress but you'll get the idea.

Both sick hens are still alive.  I'm actually really surprised that the leghorn made it through the night.  She will barely drink, and won't eat.  But she did just lay an egg (why???).

The Cochin seems to be rallying.  She is standing, and has been eating and drinking.  I have hope for her.

There- I found at least 30 bees busily flying around and they were most obviously attracted to the chicken feed in the feeder (layer pellets with high omega 3 content). I gingerly removed the feeder and took it about 20 yards away in hopes the bees would follow (my fear is that a queen was among them and looking for a nest, but it's JANUARY, that's not possible, right?).

For those who can't remember, I had 5/6 chickens massacred on Wednesday morning in full daylight.  Although many people suggested otherwise, I believed and now more firmly believe it was a dog or dogs that did it.  I spoke with my neighbor about it, and he said his dogs had been unlikely to do it since they did not bother his chickens even when out.  But he added that he had seen 3 full grown German Shepherds and a pup near my house that very morning.  Now there is only one house on the road with German Shepherds, and they're over a mile and a half away by road.  They do have that same number of dogs, but I had never seen them up near my house.  I was a little suspicious at first I might not be getting the whole truth.  But then the same neighbor stopped by later and told me his son and daughter-in-law had had a cat killed just the night before and that he was worried for his own cows which are soon to be calving.  In other words, he was going to keep a gunsight out for the predators himself.

Well I was still skeptical not knowing how the dogs had come so far and I'd never seen them on my land, but s wastill determined to keep an eye out.  So today I get home for lunch and take a mid-day run, and as I round the farm on the road, I come to a clearing where my parents' drive-way is, and lo and behold, what do I spy coming across the fields from the direction of my house, walking on my father's farm?  [A full grown German Shepherd, yes the same one who is at my heels with a dull look in its eyes when I run past the trailer it guards.](http://i.imgur.com/Ck1Uz.jpg).  I snapped this pic while on the run.

When on Wednesday I first saw the damage to the coop, this is exactly the size of dog I had in mind that had done it.  I still have not 100% determined that I'm going to kill it the next time I see it so deep on the farm, but I'm about 97% there.  But one thing is for sure, I think I can scrap the shotgun idea.  This is a case for rifles.  My thought is to arrange a crack squadron of snipers tomorrow morning to cover the intervening mile of soybean fields separating my house from the dog's proper domain.  If so, when it comes across the fields to raid tomorrow, it will be a quick death, a heaving into a truck and a dropping into a sinkhole and that'll be that.

Should I be worried?,whatsreallygoingon,9,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/12ilxi/molting_hen_with_pale_comb_and_pink_feet_should_i/,"I have three hens; a Brown Leghorn, a mature Buff Orpington, and another Buff Orpington who is less than one year old. I don't know the ages of the first two, but the mature BO is the only one which has molted, so far.

She stopped laying and dropped feathers everywhere. I've been feeding them raw meat and a bit of cat food every day. They also free range for a couple of hours most days. 

The other two look fine, but I've noticed that her comb and wattle are fairly pale. She also has developed a pink color on the back of her legs and between her toes.

Could this be due to the stress of molting, or should I investigate for parasites? The reason I am confused is that the other two show none of these signs. I hate to handle her unnecessarily, as she is currently quite cranky and was quite abused in her previous home. When she's laying, she squats and lets me frisk her; but right now she just gives me the stink eye.

Thanks for any advice.

I live in a rural area (zoned AG) but my closest neighbor (about an acre separating us) apparently stopped by yesterday and got pretty rude with my wife while I wasn't home about our chickens ""tearing up his grass"" and ""shitting all over my stuff.""  I've only seen the boys and girls in his yard a handful of times, and this guy is a typical suburban transplant who cares more about his yard than anything else in this world.  I think he's exaggerating the impact of the flock to his property (considering they have my entire acre to piddle around on and there has been zero impact to my grass) and is just offended that someone else would have use of anything around him.

I am looking to avoid constructing a run, as I don't think it's in my chickens' best interest, but I don't want to be the neighbor who is impossible to deal with or risk him trying to harm my chickens.  I'm looking for ideas and discussion points for when (if) he comes and actually talks to me.  The wife simply kept repeating ""my husband will be home tomorrow evening if you'd like to discuss it with him"" as he **berated** her for the chickens' behavior (they were on the other side of the property when he came over, and came running around the opposite corner of the house as they were talking) so I know he's got a grudge and probably won't be very flexible about it.

Any time I've seen them on or near his yard I herd them back to my property, typically all I have to do is step out the door and call and they come running.  I know they aren't tearing up his lawn, they haven't touched my grass and seem to prefer the broad leaf plants he would probably disdains.  Here are the suggestions I've come up with, hoping that he will work with me rather than come over to my house and start shouting demands:

* Alter the feeding schedule so they're more apt to stay near the house during the midday, when they seem to wander most.  
* If there are impacts to his yard, such as dust bath spots, providing additional options for them to limit their need for it.  
* Suggest he build a fence if he's **that** worried about it.  
* Provide rubber snakes he can put in strategic locations to help discourage them wandering too close to his home.  
* Educate him that if he chases them off a few times, they comply and will be discouraged.  

I really am not trying to be uncooperative, but I'm under no obligation based on where we live to make any alterations to my current setup and am honestly offended at the way he's handled the situation by cursing at my wife and storming to my house making demands before even so much as returning the neighborly wave I give him every time I see him out on his property.

So, Reddit, any suggestions on dealing with a neighbor who is living in the wrong zone for his attitude?

* Does it matter where the waterer/feeder go inside the coop?  Any particular location better than another?  I noticed some have them on the floor and others hang them, as well.

* I read chickens won't eat in the dark - does this go for drinking, too?  Will we need to install a light in our coop?

I emailed them to query this as it conflicts with the 1950s [allotment act](http://www.ruleworks.co.uk/poultry/allotments_uk.htm).

After much chasing and nagging they have finally got back to me today with this to say:

""Whilst the allotment act does allow chickens to be kept on allotments, this has not been permitted in Cardiff for many years because most of our allotments are in close proximity to residential areas and the keeping of chickens has the potential to cause and has caused nuisance to local residents, which is a breach of the tenancy agreement.  

There are also concerns about the animal welfare implications of keeping chickens and the Council does not have the necessary resources to ensure that chickens are being properly cared for. ""

Is there anything I can do about this? I don't really understand how they can trump the allotments act, nor what makes their allotments so specials as presumably most allotments are in close proximity to residential areas? There are 2000 plots in Cardiff, are they claiming every single one is unsuitable for chickens?

Even with the 50 mph winds which stretched the wrap over the wires I had no tears. The UV resistance seems to be adequate thus far and I expect I will not have to replace it before spring. However if a repair is needed all I have to do is cut a piece of wrap, lay it over the repair area and use a heat gun/ hair dryer to bond.
I left open areas on the ends for air flow which seems to have solved any humidity problem and the hens have no drafty areas. When the sun shines the inside temperature is 20 degrees higher than outside. On cloudy days the temperature gain is 5 to 10 degrees.

The other chickens are just hybrids. We got these from the farm that we have bought all our previous chickens. It is a very nice set up and all the chickens are vaccinated etc. Anyhow, the smaller 2 of these chickens did get quite harassed by the older girls.

Mine are getting nearer to that time, and I'm wondering if there are any good rules for that. Further, some are a week older/much bigger than the others, but I don't know if I should stagger their entrance into the coop or if I should put them all in at once.

Second issue: I'm finally getting close to finishing my chicken tractor. Dear freaking god this has taken forever, and way more money than I thought possible. Instead of retrofitting my plant stand (for growing garden veggies/flowers from seed), I should have started from scratch. Probably would have been far less complicated/expensive lol.

Anyways, so I'm finishing up the coop and my partner and I are at an impasse. I feel that the window coverings (the piece of wood cut out to cover the window in case of storm) should be hinged at the bottom. This would allow more sun, breezes, etc to come in, and not require a second latch system to hold it down. 

My fiance believes it would be better to hinge at the top to block falling rain, snow, etc. IMO this would block sun and require a second latch system of some sort (like chain from the roof since the window is so close to the ceiling. I'm not really sure what the chickens would prefer?

I can take pictures tomorrow if that would be helpful for people.

SURPRISE THIRD ISSUE: I was reading that you should leave your chickens in their coop (the coop area of the chicken tractor in my case) for a week or two to get them accustomed to the coop and ensure they understand its their home. How do you all feel about this with regard to a chicken tractor. I do plan on free ranging them when I am around, so I would certainly avoid that, but would it be ill advised to allow them in the run space for that period since the coop is the only sheltered place they'd have anyway?

In the middle of the square is a small raised wood pallet with a cover.  

The two main goals of a coop - cover and security - are met through a the chainlink fence for security and the covered pallet for cover.  

The fence itself is not enough - raccoons can easily climb over top and through thought the space around the door.  Also, they can probably dig around the bottom.

We have chicken wire surrounding the bottom perimeter and around the door. 

What about the top though?  Would a plastic chicken wire type material work?  Just how tenacious are raccoons when it comes to chewing through plastic to get to chickens?  

Any ideas?

I'm a chicken virgin and I've made a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wljUi7iO0mo&amp;feature=youtu.be) of my current coop/run in hopes that 'yall can take a look at it and let me know what looks right and what needs changing. In the vid you can see my girls, about seven weeks old now, and I'm very fond of them and would prefer that they not get eaten by foxes and such. 

My areas of concern are primarily predator related. If anything is unclear in the video I'll he happy to try to explain it better. We're hoping to let them run around in the yard when they get bigger (supervised playtime only) to completely ruin my already sad ""lawn"". 

At night I still have to corral them into the coop, they don't seem to get it yet. I close the laying box lid and take away the ramp access, I keep one brooder light on and the temp stays at about 70 degrees. I'm slowly weening them off of this.

All feedback and input is appreciated, thank you.

I'd like to leverage the acre as much as possible.  The first thing I'll be doing is starting a pretty large garden this summer.  Go big or go home, right?  But that's relatively easy (well, somewhat).  But my in-laws have a pretty massive garden so I'll have some good resources.

Some other friends of ours have chickens and they'll be having a few soon to give away and suggested we take them (I've hinted at being interested).  I honestly don't know much...  But I've been looking at some coops online to get feel for what I'll need.  I'll also be heading over to Agway this weekend and some other local farm supply shops for pre-constructed coops and what not.  So here's my questions!

- What can I expect for daily maintenance/tasks?  Egg collection (once they're production) as well as opening the coop in the morning and closing in the evening? (this leads into my next question)

- Do they need to be in an enclosed area during the day?  Would they roam my property and head back to their coop in the evening, or do I need to provide a top covered safety area for them to roam?  I'd love if they could walk the entire yard as we have dogs (corgi &amp; chow/retriever mix) and if they can eat up ticks - I'd be really happy!  Our yard isn't fenced in (yet) - so I'm thinking an area fenced in with netting above to keep them closed in 24/7.  If in an enclosed area, coop can remain open all the tie?

- Time away, if we need to head out for the weekend, they can likely handle themselves yes, or is it always best to get a neighbor or something to tend to them?

- Food.  I've been reading, a big thing of cracked corn feed and/or compost like veggie scraps are plenty?

- Winter.  I live in NY, we can have brutal winters (not this time around!).  What are my options come winter?

Sorry if these are pretty standard questions - I've done some Googling but haven't found a _great_ definitive source yet.  So I was happy to find this subreddit for some personal expertise.

They have always been my favorites.  I love their feathery feet, beautiful colors, and gentle nature.  My Rooster is a Partridge Cochin and I also have 2 hens.   Well one of the hens started to set and I was elated.   They would be pure babies.

Well she had been setting and setting and I knew she was close.  I hadn't noticed her one way or the other this morning, but when I went in to the barn this afternoon, I noticed that she was clearly missing and all her eggs were there.   I freaked out.  Nothing has ever killed my chickens before, but I thought she might be more vulnerable--though the 10 eggs weren't disturbed and there was no blood or feathers around.

Well I searched and searched through all of our barns and became very distraught.  It clearly looked like something had eaten my favorite girl, and so close to hatching.  

After searching for a while I go back only to find that my newest hen I got from a friend had cannibalized 5 of the eggs and they clearly had baby chickens inside.  

I HATE THAT FREAKING BIRD! Her name is now going to be SOUP!  Now I know why we haven't been finding many eggs since she came.  Jerky bird!  Adding insult to injury.

So I carefully scooped up the remaining 5 eggs and took them in the house and tried to keep them reasonably warm, I was going to look on the internet for advice on what to do with eggs so close to hatching, but I figured all was lost :(

I also thought I had something getting my chickens.  So as night approached, as they came in the barn I locked all the chickens inside and continued on with my other chores.   As we were letting in horses from a paddock closest to the barn.... who should we see?  Momma chicken with 3 chicks... and a ton of cats eye-balling them. 

So, I shoo as many cats/kittens away as possible, and then we snatched 2 of the babies, but couldn't find the third.  I knew momma made a noise for it to hide quietly. 

We put momma and her babies in a pen and looked for the last baby for a while, but then I brought the momma back outside (with out the 2 babies) and let her call around for her chicks.   She did her momma call and the chick started peeping and coming towards her.  So, we all swarmed momma, and collected the last baby, and now they are all safely inside a secure pen.   I also put the 5 remaining eggs in with momma and she set on them.  I don't know if it's too late though or if there is any hope or not, but I am just happy that momma wasn't eaten and that she has a couple babies!

TLDR: Natural chick hatching drama.

When they shipped a few weeks ago it took three days for them to arrive. All that survived were 4 of the Pekins and 8 of the white rocks. The ones that didn't show up dead died within an hour. Cackle agreed to send replacements (although with very little remorse). They were shipped this past Monday. Here is Wednesday, and they have not yet arrived. We'll be expecting them tomorrow, and I presume (with the cold weather) at least 75% again will not make it. 

Has anyone else had this bad luck ordering mail order chicks? I can't imagine that this is just part of the business. Up until now we've always bred our own birds, or bought from the feed store. Our mortality rates are always very, very low. We're no strangers to death, but I can't help but imagine the horror of a child who was ordering their first birds, opening the box, and seeing most of them dead or -- worse -- watching them die. Is this a problem with Cackle? Would we have been better to order from another hatchery? Is there something we could have done differently in our ordering? We're pretty sure they only had the one shipping option, otherwise we would've paid more to have the shipment expedited.

We decided if these show up in similar shape we'll just ask for a refund and order from either McMurry (who seems to have a good reputation) or Stromberg (who is more expensive, but we hear has better breeding stock). Any recommendations on a hatchery that you've had good experience with?

EDIT: Update! Post office just called and they are there. When we called this morning they told us the last truck had come in, but since it's ""chick days"" at Tractor Supply I'm guessing our box was mixed in with theirs and overlooked.

We do, not only for ourselves but for our small farm business (we sell people food and raw pet food). After a year of raising the occasional small batch of broilers, we're done with ordering and buying chicks. They're usually sickly and grow up looking pretty miserable. (Our worst [looked like Orson Welles](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DpJHqvQGJLE/T6ndtET0FHI/AAAAAAAAAWA/hg_h3Ek0T7Q/s640/DSC_1995.JPG), planted in the corner by the food bowl breathing heavy and not moving too much.)

We tried a little ""experiment"" and kept one of our healthier looking broiler roos. [Fernando was magnificent](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ouCNGaaL8wo/UFyqjcPv1BI/AAAAAAAABMI/6PDr_2Nn5bw/s640/IMG_20120912_191527.jpg), and a great roo (not aggressive, good with the ladies, big as hell -- 15 lbs!), but we lost him to a raccoon. While he was living we bred him to our flock of laying hens (Ameraucanas, Orpingtons, and Wyandottes), hoping we might see some example of heterosis or hybrid vigor.  And, in a way, we did. We got *some* [decent sized birds](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nP_iaEEoM6o/UOvDpdeuP5I/AAAAAAAABto/hhS8KHxCSUc/s640/DSC_1794.JPG), but none double breasted, and nothing that was really ready before 15-16 weeks. We pasture our birds, so we do expect them to grow a little slower, but I'm trying to find something that we don't need to order or buy (can be hatched on the farm) and will grow out in about 12 weeks at the most. Luckily, nothing goes to waste and the smaller birds we end up with do get put to use as pet food (where there's a market, there's a product) but I'd like to have more we can offer for human consumption.

I did a lot of looking around and find mentions everywhere of White Rocks and Dark Cornish crosses being the ""original"" Cornish-Rock cross. Often there are threads of people who ordered some (Rock hens, Cornish roos) to try it out. However, I *never* see any sort of follow up. None. We ordered some (25 White Rock pullets, 5 Dark Cornish cockerels) to raise and should be getting them in a few weeks. Once the hens get to laying age we'll start separating our flock and select a roo to keep. 

Now, I understand that the method of coming up with the commercial ""broiler"" is the product of over 50 years and a LOT of selective breeding -- I don't expect to get a bird that grows to 6 lbs in 9 weeks. I do want to find something that can give me at least a 3-4 lb dressed carcass at 12 weeks. 

What I'm wondering is if anyone has any experience in a cross like this, or if anyone is raising something else (sustainably) as a meat bird that doesn't need 16 weeks to get to a reasonable weight.

*   wrapped 3-millimeter clear plastic sheeting over the coop windows and used a staple gun to attach it.  The coop still has one section of screen that I did not cover with plastic sheeting, because I want to encourage lots of fresh air moving in and out, and because it would be tricky (but not impossible) to cover with plastic sheeting.

Heat lamps, as far as I know, come in red and white colorings.  Both generate visible light.

It's coldest in winter at late night / early morning.  

If I feel the need to run a heat lamp for my hens to keep them warm, does the light generated at night adversely affect them?  Or am I doing this (hypothetically) wrong?  Should the heat lamp be obscured by some opaque covering to allow heat without light?

I had a quick question regarding feeding young hens. they are about 5.5-6 months and are not laying yet. They are Barnevelders and Delawares, and some of them are partially blind due to being hit by Mareks disease at an early age. They survived =).

They still have a bit of pink in their combs and are often picked on by the older hens in the flock.

Starting next week, I will be releasing the older hens to free range on their own from the 40 x 40 pen, I will be keeping the younger ladies in the chicken run.

What feed would you recommend to get these ladies some weight on them? Currently, they free-range, and as a daily feed they get a nice organic layer crumble, layer pellet, chicken scratch, and oyster shell. They get good old plain yogurt, plain warm oatmeal, and freeze dried meal worms once a week (differing days).

I was considering a broiler feed, or a starter feed separated for the younger ladies? Anything to help them put on some weight before winter.

So for the sake of argument, say that I know nothing about chicken-keeping. I want to adopt several birds from battery farms, to give the old hens a good last few months or years of life. Whether they still lay or not is not a concern for me. I wanted to ask you these questions:

* First and foremost: have any of you had experience with doing this? Would you recommend it?

* I live in the UK - does anyone know of any laws or health / safety regulations that I should be aware of?

* How good are vets at suggesting the best way to bring them back to health? And how high are the costs?

* I imagine that there are bound to be some poor birds that are just too injured or old to ever properly recover from a battery-laying life. Is it wrong to refuse taking birds that are *so* injured that it would be a large burden on me to nurse them back to health? Would it be cruel of me to prolong would could be a painful remainder of their lives, or is it never too late to try?

I'm a new chicken keeper and my girls are just 2 months old.  I have a couple acres and I let them free-range during the day.  They always stay very close to their coop.  Yesterday I left to run an errand and didn't lock them back in before I left.  When I came home I couldn't find them.  I eventually found about half of them in the blackberry vines on one side of the property and some more in a group on the other side of the property.  They were very skittish and I couldn't even coax them out with their favorite treat.  One was missing.  Hours went by.  I started to fear the worst when she climbed out from under a board in the yard.  Her tail feathers had been pulled out and there was a pile of them near the board.  I suspected a dog, and one dog in particular.  This was confirmed when it came over here again today and there was a big fiasco with people and chickens running everywhere.

I should say that I like my neighbors.  Our kids are great friends.  As an animal person I even like their dog.  She's just a puppy, maybe 6-8 months old.  As their teenager helpfully pointed out (while we were frantically trying to get between this dog and our flock) she *is* a bird dog.  I know they do try to keep her from running wild, but not very hard.
  
I don't know what to do about it.  Well I do know; I need to put up a fence, but it's a lot more complicated than that.  Our property line is essentially berry vines, bushes, and big trees.  We either have to fence inside of this landscaping- cutting ourselves off from it, weave through it somehow, or cut some of it down.  Either way it's going to be expensive, ugly, and a huge hassle.  I'm pissed that I have to do this when my chickens are staying on *my property*.  I'm pissed that I have to keep them cooped up for who knows how long until I can figure out a fence.  I'm pissed that anyone would get a dog and let it just run around the neighborhood.

I guess I'm just pissed!  Thanks for letting me vent.

Help!,deathshower,5,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1heaxs/two_hens_dead_in_a_week_help/,"I just lost two hens within 7 days of each other, and I'm concerned we may have some sort of disease in our flock.  Any thoughts this community may have about what might be going on would be much appreciated!  Here's the backstory:

 

We had 8 laying hens, various breeds, which I purchased from other people as adults.  Back in mid-April, one of our girls fell sick.  She was, as best I know, about 3 years old and looked like an Australorp.  She got a droopy comb, became very lethargic, wasn't eating, and stopped laying.  I examined her and discovered that she was extremely swollen just below the vent.  I initially thought she was egg-bound, but after more research and a phone call to an avian vet, ascites due most likely to internal laying seemed more probable.  After a few days she seemed a bit perkier and I put her back in the coop.  I don't think she ever laid again, her comb remained droopy, and she was always the first to roost every night, but she was eating fine and running around with her girlfriends.  She hung in there until one week ago, when we found her dead in the coop.

 

Sometime in May, maybe 2 weeks after I first examined the chicken described above, another one of our hens fell ill.  She's a 3 or 4 year old game hen, a tough little bird.  She was fine one moment, and maybe 5 minutes later I went back out and found her lying on the floor of the coop, unable to stand or walk.  She had her legs splayed out, toes apart, legs tense and outstretched, one in front of the other almost like she was doing the splits.  She was laying on her side.  She was unable to close her toes even to grip the roost.  After an hour or so, however, she was fine again.  We asked the guy at our feed store about it and he suggested that maybe she had had the misfortune of eating a bug or something that had been poisoned or exposed to pesticide.  Nothing more happened, and we put it behind us.  This hen lays almost every day and acts totally normal.

 

Then today, I found another bird dead on the floor of the coop.  This was a young barred rock, only about a year old -- she had started laying in January or February of this year.   She was absolutely fine yesterday, then this morning, she was dead.  There was a very small amount of blood around her nostrils, but no other sign of trauma.  Her legs, however, are splayed out in exactly the same manner I described above, and her neck is twisted around as though she were looking behind her or pecking something on her back between her wings.

 

I am at a complete loss for what might be going on.  I don't know if the two deaths are related or not, I don't know if the temporary paralysis incident is related to either death, both, or neither...  

 

We considered the possibility that the barred rock experienced the same paralysis symptoms as the game hen, but then overheated or dehydrated because she was unable to get to water... we live in southern AZ and the high temperatures are currently in the neighborhood of 110 degrees F.  It seems awfully fast for her to die of dehydration, but it I suppose it may be possible in an animal her size...  Other people have suggested simple heat stress.  I just put out a little tub of water for them to stand/splash around in, hosed down the coop, and put out a couple frozen 2 liter bottles. The coop is also very well shaded and ventilated, and they have an automatic waterer so they never run out of drinking water.  We've also considered the possibility that our flock is infected with some sort of disease and the game hen was able to fight it off, while the barred rock succumbed.  

 

We've been having a huge problem with wild sparrows getting in through the poultry wire and eating the chickens' feed -- I'm a little stumped on what to do about that.  I've seen people put bird netting over the poultry wire, but the problem with that is that the sparrows get their feet tangled in it and die gruesome deaths.  I've also considered a treadle feeder, but haven't tried it.  The birds would still be able to get into the coop, but maybe they wouldn't if there were no readily available feed to attract them...  At any rate, I'm concerned about the possibility that the wild birds may have introduced some pathogen to my flock.  I've also noticed some signs that they may have mites -- I havent seen any actual mites, but a few of the hens --not all-- have been pecking their feathers out just above the base of their tails.  I just bought some dust at the feed store to get rid of any mites they may have.

 

I've tried to do some research online about what might be going on here but I haven't had much success narrowing it down. Chicken diseases are complicated and there's a huge amount of overlap in easily observable symptoms!  Seems like the real diagnostic criteria require lab tests and/or much more technical physical examinations than I'm qualified to do.  I'm hoping that some of you out there who have more experience with chickens than I do will have some thoughts on our little chicken mystery...  I really don't want to lose any more of my flock, but I have no idea what to do for them.

 

Thank you all very much in advance!

I'm not sure how he did it, but when I'd gone to make sure he and the other rooster were in the coop, I saw it.  

It broke at the base by the foot and caused some of the scale-like top of the toe to break and hang off  There was no noticeable swelling, but I could see the faint signs of some internal bleeding just under the skin, only at the break.

I cleaned it, set it back straight, and wrapped it with some self-sticking gauze wrap. I made a sort of splint out a tiny strip of sturdy cardboard (a piece of popsicle stick was too big) and secured it to his other two toes for support.

The next day it was fine.  Still no swelling at all and the hanging scales were already healing back in place with some healthy scabs.  Today, however, I noticed a slight greenish color under the skin when I was changing the wrap.

There is still absolutely no swelling. The coloring is a dark olive green sort of color and seems to be under the skin around the sight of the break rather than more toward the skin surface.  There is no sort of discharge, typical bruising, blood, or anything else.  Just the little area of green under the skin in that spot.

He seems to have little to no pain.  I've been keeping him in the coop while he heals, but he gets around fine inside. The wrapping seems to confuse him a bit and he sometimes stumbles, but otherwise is walking on it with a slight limp with no trouble.

Is this anything to be worried about or is it just bruising of some kind? That was my first thought, but the green tint to it has thrown me off a bit.

If it's needed, I'll post some pictures of the color and the wrapping I did once I can find my camera cord.",,False,self,t5_2sdri,False,,,True,t3_1h4q12,http://www.reddit.com/r/BackYardChickens/comments/1h4q12/broken_toe_now_has_greenish_coloring_on_foot/,

I took your advice by replacing the chicken wire with hardware cloth.  I am pretty sure it was a raccoon that did it, as my hound dog went out in the woods the afternoon after the raid, and brought me the missing four after I posted the thread.  No heads or guts.  :(  Poor dog has been standing by the empty run since then, staring into the woods.

So, now the run is covered in the hardware cloth, the doors are double locked, the bottom is double chicken wired so they can peck and scratch but nothing can just dig inside, any slight cracks/slits have been boarded with my remaining wood, and I put a spotlight on it.  I am also still going to keep my dog outside at night to at least alert me if something comes (moved the run right outside my window so I can hear her this time).

My neighbor gave me two roosters she said were extremely protective of her own hens.  They are friendly to me, but have already spurred one of my other dogs in the nose (not the one who watches them, though, they seem fine with her since she isn't the one who barked at them), so fingers crossed!

**Now for my question!**

I am bringing home some chicks today to replace my passed on girls, and I'm not sure how to introduce them to the roosters...

I am keeping them indoors until they get a bit bigger and have adult feathers come in, and have a rabbit cage I can fit into the run, so I was thinking of doing it that way so they all see each other and spend time with each other, but can't just reach each other.

What do you chicken-veterans suggest?  I want them to get along when they finally meet!

*Oh, and just an FYI, I live in the rural woods.  We are surrounded by trees and I know there are a lot of preditors out there; I hear (and sometimes see) them every night.  These chickens will live in their moble run and hutch for safety, they're not just out in the open, and are kept feet away from the house.*

***TL;DR:  My last chickies did not survive a raccoon raid.  I have fixed up the run and added two roosters for safety.

Our pet Black Australorp hen normally roams our back yard freely, eating whatever bugs and weeds she wants. She eats kitchen scraps, too. She knocks on our door with her beak to request more food; we give her laying ration, leftovers from our own meals, and raw brown rice, which she loves. She's very healthy and lays an egg nearly every day. We have no idea how much food total she normally eats. We let her out of her house in the morning, and shut her back in after dark, to protect her from the rats and possums that killed our other two chickens and that have attacked her.

Last time we went on vacation, I told our caregivers to give her one cup of scratch daily. That was a terrible underestimate! She was so hungry when we got home. I felt terribly when I saw how hungry she was! I thought it would be enough because it was more than I usually gave her, but I wasn't counting the bugs and slugs she normally gets to eat every day while roaming the whole yard.

We can't tell our caregivers to way overfeed her, though, because that would draw rats. We really don't want to draw rats! We've fixed her pen so that possums can't get in, but we can't keep out rats. They can get through even tiny cracks. They can go right through the spaces between the wires in the fence.

Our caregivers want to visit only once each day. This will work fine if they visit early enough that she has plenty of time to eat her food. We do not want to ask them to visit at dawn and dusk to let her out of her little house and to shut her back in. She should be fine in her pen for a week, as long as we don't have them give her enough food that it's still lying around all night, drawing predators.

First of all, what breed would you guys recommend? I think a mixed flock could be nice, so maybe 2 or 3 breeds. Number one traits I'm looking for are quiet, docile, good laying, and I guess ability to tolerate confinement because I'll most likely just have a covered run and coop. I want to give them as much space as possible, but definitely no free ranging. I don't care much about appearance, egg color, broodiness, etc. I'm in northern california which is pretty warm all of the time (zone 10A for gardening people) so cold hardiness isn't really a factor either. It will get up to about 90ºF in the summer though.

Second, I'm going to graduate this year but I want to have the coop and run maintained after me by volunteers. I want to make it as easy as possible for them to clean so I'm wondering what would be the best ground cover- hay, sand, dirt, etc. for the run. I'm looking for the least work-intensive, least stinky one that you'd only have to clean up every once in a while.

Third- I think I know the answer to this, but do chickens do best in the sun? I'm trying to figure out where I want the run to be on campus and I found a good spot but its shady pretty much all day. Probably wouldn't be too happy here I'm guessing, but what do you guys think?

Fourth- Any other suggestions and advice are very much appreciated. Thanks in advance for the help.

Rather belatedly it's occurred to me that the thin shells might from a lack of calcium in their diet, so I took some pruning shears and chopped some turkey bones I'd boiled into broth into about 1-2 cups of bone chips.  The chickens ate **all** the bone chips, so I think the low calcium hypothesis I looking pretty good as the source of the egg eating.

Now to my actual question, If I give the chickens enough calcium will they still eat their eggs?  I've heard that egg eating is a pretty ingrained habit one the chickens start, so I'm a bit worried that they'll keep egg eating even after I've improved their diet.

They're in a converted box stall in my 1900's barn, ceiling is meshed, floor is not and is a dirt / sand floor. I'm in eastern Ontario. 

I've been losing birds in the coop over the last 2 months - first my two silkies (one was non-violent, the second with a bloodied neck) and then an older barred rock (which wasn't bloodied) and last night I was in the coop doing night rounds when an alert white little face popped out of the ground. I froze, and one of the hens went after it and the little fucker fought back which was when I realized I wasn't dealing with one of the smaller weasels (short tailed) but probably something bigger. The weasel wasn't afraid of me and did a bit of scurrying from the hole in the coop to the the space between the box stall and the standing stall. Upon researching last night I think I'm dealing with a long-tailed weasel. 

This morning I was out by the wood pile and I could hear the hens just going on - abnormally so. I went into the coop and found my silkie rooter bloodied on the back of the head and neck and still alive. He's in a box up in the bathroom - we'll see if he survives but I'm not hopeful. 

I have a small live trap that I can use now but frankly I have no interest in keeping this little fucker alive. Has anyone used rat traps for this kind of thing? I've read that you should bait the traps with whatever the weasel is after - so in this case, chicken. Anyone have any experience with this?

Any info would be appreciated. I won't be able to get my birds into a proper hen house until the early summer so moving them isn't an option. 

TL;DR: Help me kill a long tailed weasel that's treating my chickens like a buffet. 

ETA: My silkie roo is still alive. He's a bit sketchy and hasn't eaten / drank anything but he's still kicking in his box in the bathroom. Considering the cold snap we're about to have, looks like he'll be a house chicken for the next week or so. He also badly needs a bath.

Our chickens have free reign of our backyard, so it's not uncommon for me to kind-of lose track of one for a bit while she's hiding under the shed or in some weird corner or something, so I'm not sure how long it's been, but it's been at least a day since I saw her. I searched the backyard and the surrounding forest area, but I don't see any clues like a pile of feathers or anything to indicate she was nabbed by an animal or something. The only thing I can figure is that she somehow made it outside the fence and was attacked elsewhere or became lost, or that one of my neighbors decided it was easier to get a chicken from my yard than to get one from the grocery store.
