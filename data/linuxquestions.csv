The system is booting fine using GRUB2 from the Ubuntu Server 12.04.2 host system and I have installed Wget and OpenSSH along with their dependencies.  I believe everything is functioning correctly so I would like to back up this *Base System* if you will.

* What is the preferred method of doing this?

I have backed up numerous things along the way using tar and zip:

* I backed up the base toolchain as recommended in the book, as a tar.gz archive.

* I backed up the *first boot* filesystem as a tar.gz

* Moving on to BLFS I backed up all of the original sources in a tar.gz archive.  I then removed these sources excluding the kernel just to have a tidy sources directory.

Now, I am learning a lot but I am unsure how to properly back up the entire system to a point where I can reliably restore it to an empty partition on another machine (or another partition on the same machine).  

* Is a tar.gz archive enough to do this?  

* Will anything get lost in the archiving and restoration - permissions, links, etc.. ?

* Is DD a *better* option or the *only* option?

I would be very grateful if someone could give me a little guidance here so I can play around no end with **my** linux - with no fear of foobarring all my hard work so far.


**p.s.** I have to mention that this is my third attempt at this so I really want a rock solid backup of the entire system.  My first attempt did not go well at all - I managed to get mixed up with two different versions of the book so I had all sorts of errors.  My second *attempt* was great,  I went with a separate /boot which was a little confusing but I got it booting with the help of a live distro and even got so far as getting X up and running, however, I could not get X over SSH working which was disappointing.  At that point, I realised another stable book had been released so I thought why not build this, and here I am. xD

I've been learning of different elements of the system, devices and architectures, the drives, the networking, all fine and dandy... Until I hit the topic of graphics.

To be honest, I'm stumped. There's so many elements, technologies, bits and pieces and I'm finding it really complicated to piece it all together. Even from the kernel level, there are regular drivers, and there are some DRI drivers, and then there's framebuffer... The X server has its own drivers, there are the official ones, and prioprietary ones... There's something called Mesa, then there's something called Gallium, and one is supposed to replace the other, but on the Mesa website, it says they're merged...

I've been looking into all these things since, builidng my own Linux, I'd prefer to have it fairly modern and future-compliant, but... Well, the graphics stuff seems to be quite a mess.

BTW Windows 8 told me on one of the settings screens that out of a 500 GB drive, I had something like 165 GB free. Once I copy Ubuntu over to this drive, I'll have over 460 GB free instead.

So, one question: I have a SATA/IDE-to-USB adapter to plug one of the two drives. I figured that I could boot with a Live CD and use dd to copy the old 320 GB drive's partitions to the new one.

Will dd work with one of the drives plugged through the USB adapter, or do both drives need to be directly connected to an SATA port? I don't intend to keep the Windows partition.

UPDATE: I did the copy. 40 MB/s took 2 hours. The system (all folders except home) partition copied flawlessly. However, there were a lot of damaged files in the home partition, for some reason. I had a backup, so no data was lost.

UPDATE: acpi_osi= in the boot options enables all the soft keys, except Wi-Fi toggle. Even the calculator shortcut key works!

I like the challenge of trying to imagine a ""perfect"" setup and I'd love to hear what Reddit has to say about my suggestion:


1) Install Linux to a bootable USB pen-drive - which distribution you choose probably won't matter much, but assume I'm using Debian Squeeze in this example.

During installation, configure an entirely encrypted filesystem using TrueCrypt.


2) Install and configure Tor, using Polipo as a proxy and with the help of the Torbutton-addon for Firefox ensure that web-browsing uses the Tor network.
For good measure, setup the computer to act as a Tor-relay, the extra Tor-traffic won't make it any easier to see what it is originating from you and what is just relayed packets at any rate.


3) Install ttdnsd to use Tor also for DNS-queries, configure several/many DNS-servers so it will spread the requests among those instead of sending everything to just one server or one ISP.


4) Setup rules in IPtables that drop all non-Tor traffic, ensuring that not a single packet is sent through anything but the Tor network. Also, block all HTTP-traffic to prevent unencrypted web-traffic and force the use of SSL.


5) Create an email-account while using Tor, ensuring that the identity of the person using the address is not revealed. The e-mail provider must allow IMAP with SSL/TLS or a web-interface that uses SSL. Their SMTP-server must also only accept incoming email using SMTP over SSL, and only attempt sending to other SMTP-servers the same way - Never use unencrypted SMTP as a fallback. 


6) Install Pidgin for Instant-Messaging, and use the OTR-plugin to encrypt the messages being sent between those chatting, only allow OTR-enabled use.
The IM-account used will of course be the same as the email-account mentioned above. Configure Pidgin to tunnel all traffic through Polipo using SOCKS.

7) Use PGP to encrypt files like documents, videos, etc. when sending to someone
through email or over an IM-network.

8) Create a script that changes the MAC-address of the NIC used, and another script
that changes it back when Linux is shutdown. Also, use shred/wipe or similar ""secure"" file-deletion commands when erasing files, good candidates would be all logfiles and bash-history.

9) When running Linux from this pendrive it would probably be wise to use either
free wi-fi hotspots or crack into a WEP or WPA-encrypted network if truly desperate,
the former obviously being more morally sound, while the latter allows encryption of traffic between the wifi-adapter and the AP of the wireless netwok. Either way, not using an Internet-connection that is somehow connected to yourself privately or your work-place is important, obviously.

(originally posted on: http://www.reddit.com/r/linux4noobs/comments/1gl18i/distributing_game_binaries_on_linux_how/ - I've been told to post it here)

Hello everyone, I'm trying to create a distro-independent archive for my game, Open Hexagon, which should not require compiling from source, but simply extracting and running the game.

To distribute my game on Windows, I create a .7z archive containing binaries, data and shared libraries, and it works well.

I'm trying to follow a similar model for my Linux archive:

* I created `./x86/` and `./x86_64/` folders, which contain binaries and shared libraries (also `libstdc++.so.6`).

* To run the game, the user executes `./OpenHexagon`, which is a bash script that detects whether the OS is 32-bit or 64-bit, then sets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to either `./x86/` or `./x86_64/`, and runs the correct executable.

Also, here's part of the script I'm using:

    if [ ""$ARCH"" == ""x86_64"" ]; then
    		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./x86_64/
    		./x86_64/openhexagon.x86_64 $@
    	else
    		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./x86/
    		./x86/openhexagon.x86 $@
    	fi
    
In theory it should work, but users reported the following error:

&gt;/x86_64/openhexagon.x86_64: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/./libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.18' not found (required by ./x86_64/openhexagon.x86_64)

I have two questions:

1. How can I fix that error? `libstdc++.so.6` is correctly bundled in the archive, but it still doesn't work.

2. Is there a better way to create a similar archive? Not a distro-based package (eventually, I'll create one), but sharing libraries and binaries as I am doing.

 I've got quite a bit of experience using linux and I enjoy it, but it was mainly focused on server administration. I also have a personal computer running debian so I can defend myself with the window managers.
 
 Currently I'm working for a company which wants to migrate almost every computer to linux systems (if you are curious, they are using Lubuntu). Almost everything is going fine but I'm having some trouble when it comes to network printers and I barely have any experience with them under linux.
 
 Most of our printers are B&amp;W which are used on points of sale to print bus tickets (yes, we are a bus company) and the generic drivers or the drivers provided by the manufacturers are usually good enough.
 
 But we have some issues with color printers and we are unable to make them work, even when using the specific driver provided by the maker (canon, in this case, the model is a irc2380i). We can print normally, but not in full color. I've tested every release of the original canon drivers.
 
 I'm not trying to get model-specific advice here, but something more generic. What do you do in these cases? changing the printer isn't an option because this is a corporate environment. 
 
 I'm using cups' web access to add and locate network printers and I try to use the drivers provided by the manufacturers in most of the cases. Sometimes I need to use alien to create .debs from .rpms but that's fine. The question is: what do I do when these drivers fail? Is there any workaround? I've managed to make some models work using generic printer drivers, but that's rare.
 
 Does anyone have some advice to share? I would really appreciate it.
 
 Thanks in advance.

**EDIT**: Finally, I did it.

This is what I did in order to make my Canon iR C2380i print in color under Linux (specifically, Lubuntu).

* I downloaded the 2.60 UFR2 drivers from [here](http://support-au.canon.com.au/contents/AU/EN/0100270808.html).
* First I tried to make UFR drivers work, but I got an arcane libcanon_pdl.c error so I had to move to another solution.
* I downloaded the Canon Cque 2.10 drivers from [here](http://es.software.canon-europe.com/products/0010555.asp).
* I installed the printer via cups using the PXL driver.
* I changed the default options of the printer from greyscale to full color.

Et voilá!

Tried this under x86 and x64 systems.

The CQue thing sounds odd, but I think that there's a filter included in the package that is used by the PXL driver, I can't guarantee it though.

Anyway, thanks to every one of you, you were very kind and helpful!

This was several years ago and I have since been working mainly on Linux systems. I got a call from the university saying they wanted to physically move the server &amp; needed to shut it down gracefully. So, I made a user account for the their tech and added him to the wheel group, then set the root password to something for him to use to shut the server off. Once the move was done, I logged back in and changed the password back to what I *thought* it should be. Now, the problem: None of the passwords that I may have used for root account on this server work. Maybe it was a typo (two times in a row, I guess). So, I can SSH in as my regular user account, but I can't su to root. The method that I know to reset a root password involves single user mode, but here's the kicker: *single user mode is protected by the root password* Arrgh!

There's also no recent backup image because nobody at the university has been looking after this server, hence their need to call me to give their tech access. Double arrgh.

Now, I'm fully aware of the stupidity of my mistake. Please spare me further humiliation, since I already feel as though I should crawl in a hole and die, or at least receive 50 lashes from a wet noodle.

So, on a scale of 1-10, how far up a creek without a paddle am I? Is there a way to reset the root password on a FreeBSD box, even when locked out of single user mode? This is my Hail Mary pass, so I'd be happy with any helpful suggestion. Thanks!

*** So, eventually I found a solution ***

Fortunately, I work about 20 minutes from my alma mater, so I was able to drive out and get physical access to the server. However, most of my now Linux-slanted thinking did not help, for two main reasons:

1) I wasn't able to find a live CD that could mount a *writable* UFS partition...just read-only

2) FreeBSD doesn't use /etc/shadow, it uses /etc/master.passwd

So, without a way to mount my UFS partitions in a writable way, I followed Self_Hating_Human's advice and used the FreeBSD install media to find &amp; enter the ""fixit"" shell. Once I was there, I was able to mount the partition with /etc, and remove the password prompt from single user mode (this is done by either marking consoles as ""secure"" for no password prompt or ""insecure"" for a password prompt in /etc/ttys).

After that, it was a simple matter of booting into single user mode with my USB keyboard, which is a bit different in FreeBSD:

1) At the boot menu, escape to the loader prompt

2) `set hint.atkbd.0.flags=""0x1""`

3) `boot -s`

From there, I just ran `passwd` and reset the root password. Rebooted and all is well. Lessons learned!

I am really new to linux, but decided to take the plunge and buy some books and a server to play with break and fix when I do break it. So far I installed Ubuntu server on my PE 2950 (picked it up for less than 100 with 3 15k drives I was excited about that one lol). 

I have installed small programs just to get my feet wet. (minecraft, teamspeak, feed the beast). 

My goal is to eventually become an Sysadmin and all the redhat stuff. That's down the raod a ways though. I do need some help and guidance though.

I want to do a few more things and don't know where to start. I would like to start and host a website (hello world style), have remote access to the server so i can log in while on vacation and play with it, and have a file server as well for home storage kind of stuff. 

Then onto the security side I would like to have something slightly more beefy than a ""firewall"", but not so complex even a jarhead like me can't understand.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, but remember to break it down barney style for me. So i can learn instead of just copy and paste command line stuff.



Edit: Thanks for all the help and support so far! I had my wife burn me a CentOS disk for install tonight.

EDIT 2: CentOS is installed TS is up and running Minecraft is giving me issues, but thats typical. I am still having issues with getting putty and the whole ssh thing to work. IS openssh-server something that has to be installed or is it already installed?

I'm subscribed to a number of cloud services and having an additional copy which isn't in my flat seems like a good idea.  However, that does create the problem of actually connecting to that data without already having the correct system configuration.

I had thought about just using a backup utility like rdiff... but this does not appear to satisfy my desire to be able to replicate my configuration, it's just (more or less) a copy of the system as it currently exists.

I have one computer left yet to follow the total conversion, and ironically, it's my own desktop. I've got Steam to look forward to now, so there is no use in pretending I won't have TF2 or CS:GO to play eventually.

Here's my issue: I have this mouse called the ""Saitek R.A.T.7"". It's been my mouse of choice for about 6 months now. It is **notorious** for sucking in Linux. There are all kinds of terrible problems, which are supposed to be fixed by following [these](http://delightlylinux.wordpress.com/2012/03/07/using-the-cyborg-r-a-t-7-with-ubuntu/) steps, [these](http://fcns.eu/2011/04/01/cyborg-rat-7-mouse-under-linux/) steps, or [these](http://www.gdargaud.net/Hack/LinuxMouse.html), and I'm here to tell you they all cause my *buntu system of choice to flip out.

___

I'm not as well versed in hardware as I'd like to be yet, and that's why I'm coming to you. 

I use an AMD 6870 card, and In order to facilitate the use of my mouse, I have to generate an xorg.conf file. Now, this isn't as easy as it used to be, because no single Ubuntu distro ships with one anymore, so you have to run 'Xorg -configure'. But again, that doesn't work, because you have to stop 'lightDM' or 'KDM' or whatever you're using, by hitting CTRL-ALT F1, and stopping the service. From there, you can then generate the needed .conf file, and edit it how they instruct to do so on the sites. 

After following those instructions, a few things happen: 

Ubuntu's Compiz crashes like a motherfucker every .05 seconds. So I switched to Xubuntu to try and remedy this, and it worked fine, but then when I tried to install the OS AMD drivers, the system crashed and refused to boot back up (not even listing error messages to the screen, so I'm assuming something went terribly, terribly wrong with the driver setup.

I tried various combinations of order, version, and all that jazz, and the closest I got was under Xubuntu 12.10, installing the latest OSS drivers for AMD cards first, then creating and editing the .conf file. 

Problem was again, just really unspecific messages like 'An error has occured [ok] [cancel]' every 5 to 10 minutes.

So my question is;

I have another question thread for everyone. I have a growing list of gadgets and computer parts I want to get, and I'm adding SSDs to the collection. I've done a little searching, and the best ~$100 drives seem to be the Crucial m4 series and the Samsung 830 series. I've seen guides for making Linux SSD-friendly, but they all seem to be a few years old, or they just take things from other guides without giving a clear reason to the options chosen. So, I'd rather ask you guys for the up to date info.


My questions to you are as follows:

1) How have SSDs improved since this time last year?

2) Are they more reliable? Can they be used for daily computing? Could you have a machine with only an SSD and not worry about write wear? 

3) Along those lines, how has the kernel adapted to work with SSDs? Does it automatically set options for them, or would I need to manually edit fstab? Would I need to disable certain system processes like logging and file access times? Should I use a normal HDD for things like downloads and /tmp, and let the SSD hold the actual programs and system files?

4) What kind of partitioning and filesystems are recommended for an SSD? One whole partition running Btrfs? Two equal partitions using only FAT32 and EXT4? Should I put Home on a HDD and everything else on a SSD? Would it be better to get a hybrid SSD/HDD drive (called it) and wait for pure SSDs to be refined some more?

5) How many people here have been using SSDs for more than a few months? What have been your experiences with them so far? Have you had any wear out? Have you had any filesystem issues? Does it make a noticeable difference in daily use? Is it a highly recommended upgrade for normal (relatively) users, or is it only something a PC gamer or video editor would appreciate? Any problems worth noting? Any advice?

6) Imagine a system that is constantly downloading podcasts, webcomics, RSS feeds, YouTube videos, etc.; or in other words, does lots of writing and deleting and re-writing. Would an SSD be suitable for that machine? Would it wear out too quickly?

7) On the of drives failing, are SSDs suitable for being personal backup drives? Are they more reliable than platter drives when it comes to storing backups? I think they merely lose write ability when worn out, so you'd still be able to read off them, right? Would some kind of SSD software RAID option be good? (-or possible?) What about a cheap HDD RAID 3? Would it be better to avoid complicated enterprise backup solutions that I barely understand, and just use a single external USB drive for backups?

8) Back to solid states. Is SSD technology rock solid yet? Besides the concern over wearing, these chips don't tend to suffer from shorts, overheating, write errors, data loss, or anything like that, right? What about the software side of things? Has the Linux ecosystem decided on the standard implementation and optimizations, or is it still a bit of a guessing game?

9) Are there any points I missed, or questions that I should have asked? Feel free to give any more info you want.

Well, I guess that's all I have to ask about for now. As you might have guessed, I'm curious to try out an SSD, but I might just wait a few years until I build a new machine to bother with them. It depends on how reliable and useful they are. I'd have to reinstall my system either way...

However, this plan is all in the mind. Every time I boot the computer, I find there is a constant empty feeling inside me that is making me postpone things.  

Have you ever experienced this lack of motivation? How can I find something to do incrementally that will keep me occupied with Linux at least a couple of hours per day? Are there any projects for this kind of thing?  

What would you suggest?

**Suggestions so far:**  

1. Start a project to beat lack of motivation
1. Edit Conky
1. Customize Bash
1. Learn Ruby on Rails for web dev
1. Hack away at things in `/etc/` (exercise proper caution)
1. Explore [coreutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/)

1. **Profit**

Obviously, the first step for this was to put /home on a separate partition, so I could safely reformat root without losing my home directory. But that didn't take care of preserving any customizations I had made to system files in the root partition, so I thought of an interesting way to deal with that.

Here's what I do: in my home folder (i.e., the one on the /home partition), I have a directory called ""system_files"". If I want to change a system configuration file, or add a new one, I put it in there in a path mirroring where it would be in the root partition. So, for example, if I want to add a new udev rule, I put it in the following path:

~/system_files/etc/udev/rules.d

Then go to the real root path where that file should go (in this case, ""/etc/udev/rules.d""), and create a symbolic link to the file in my system_files folder.

This way, when the system goes to /etc/udev/rules.d/ it sees the file I added or modified and reads it as if it were in that folder. But if I ever have to wipe out root and start from scratch, the file itself is preserved in my home folder in a path that tells me where it's supposed to go once the system is set up.

So, my question is: can anyone see anything wrong with this technique? Is there a risk or a downside I haven't considered? Or have I just reinvented someone else's wheel?

I recently discovered cygwin. I also saw that the whole clang/gcc stack is in the cygwin package manager, so I am wondering:
When I created a application, with let's say C++11 which uses OpenGL and some POSIX functionality and it compiles fine under Linux, can I compile the same program in cygwin and I get a running windows exe or do I have to be smarter and use an native windows environment and link agains the cygwin1.dll to get something which runs under Windows?

I tried to run Euro Truck Simulator 2 with it. It was the only game I had an issue with as when I tried to open it, the screen would become black. I had to manually open the config file of the game and run it in windowed mode. Then when I got it to run I had a ton of shader problems. I also had extremely low FPS into the single digits and the game was so dark, even when driving in sunlight it appeared to be night.

Enter Linux Mint 15 RC. When I upgraded from Linux mint 14 I removed and purged old kernels and settings, because I wanted to start fresh. I know I wouldn't usually have to, but I wanted to see if it had any impact. I rebuilt the amd catalyst package files as .deb and installed. I could finally run it in fullscreen mode, but otherwise, still the same mess with the shaders and low FPS. I believe it was a bug with Cinnamon 1.6. Upgrading to 1.8 fixed this issue.

Whenever I build fglrx .deb's, I have cleaned out the system using apt-get purge fglrx* and cleaned out xorg.conf.

Today I just wanted to see if a total reinstall of the system would make any change.

I wiped my partitions after I had done a backup, reinstalled Linux Mint 15 RC, rebuilt the catalyst driver and installed it. Euro Truck Simulator runs in fullscreen, no shader problems and fps are now in the double digits, sometimes hitting 60.

So, now I'm a little bit confused as I thought when I purged, cleaned files and manually edited xorg.conf and/or restored a clean backup, that this shouldn't be allowed to happen, right?

My Linux Mint 14 system was pretty fresh and clean as I don't like clutter on my system and random applications installed that I rarely use. I upgraded by changing every repository to the Olivia repository, doing an upgrade to what one can expect with when installing a fresh Linux Mint 15. New Cinnamon, new everything. Can anybody explain to me how this can happen? Does FGLRX install other files that are not purged/cleaned? 

I had checked what the gpu was running at when the game was loaded and the GPU was showing it was running at 925 MHZ as opposed to 300 MHZ otherwise when it's not running graphically demanding stuff. I had no power saving features running or anything. 

English isn't my main language, but I hope I worded myself somewhat correctly so it's easy to understand what I'm asking here.

Thank you.

If I set Swappiness to 100, it'll use SWAP way more often, but can also decrease the life of the device, in this case, my SD Card, but due to a limited amount of RAM, 386MBs, the SWAP space is really needed to prevent running out of memory. However, I've heard that SWAP is a LOT slower than RAM, especially on an SD card, so would the performance hit be significant, and would the constant swapping really kill my SD Card after using it so much? Swappiness 0 means it will only swap if an out-of-memory occurs, but Android controls that by killing programs, so it may not get the chance to be used like it should. What if I set the swappiness down to, say, 50 as a compromise? I set mine to 100 because a guide I used to set it up instructed me to, but there was little on the risks or benefits of setting certain settings.  I know this should be in /r/Android, but I tried asking a question there and I didn't get many responses, and since Android uses the Linux kernel, I'm sure it'd be beneficial to post here as well.

To reiterate: Yes, I'm using Android, and I have posted a question there but I didn't get many replies. I have an HTC Evo Shift 4G with 386MBs of RAM, and a SWAP file (not a partition) size of 512MBs, and Swappiness set to 100 on an SD Card. What Swappiness setting would you recommend?

Three very popular open source projects and they all use alt-drag input... on linux... which MOVES THE WINDOW INSTEAD! (maybe someone should tell them?)


Don't get me wrong, not having to aim for the title bar to move windows or hunt down the window border to resize is yet another joy of linux window managers. In fact I keep altdrag.exe on a USB so I can have it on windows too.


Unlike altdrag, I can't find any way to blacklist windows from being dragged. Some people attempt to rebind the alt key per program (tedious) and others rebind alt to super/windows in the window manager (still a workaround, not a solution).

I've been using XP practically my entire life. I loved it. I hated Vista. Windows 7, eh. But, I finally went through with installing Ubuntu. I loved it! ABSOLUTELY, loved it. Smooth, simple(excluding the Terminal), the concept of it all. 

One problem: I am using, Rpg Maker VX ACE, and there is no way--at least from the couple hours of research I did--to use it on Ubuntu. Or, well, Linux. Wine is a no-go. (Most research was done on RMVXA forums, coming to think about it.)

The program is a must. I enjoy making games. And, I'm actually making one for my son. 

I was thinking about dual booting, and just using XP for the game. But, Ubuntu would get frustratingly laggy at the most random times. I'm using a Dell 8400, everything is stock, except I have 2gbs of RAM and 250 hard-drive. 

Now, I consider myself apt with computers, Windows very much so. But I just felt that everything was out of my control. Which really means I just need to learn. But, it took me a couple of forums, and three youtube videos to figure out how to get Dropbox to work.

So, basically, any helpful ideas? A smaller Linux OS? Should I dual boot? (If I do, what--if any--repercussion would there be?) Just suck it up and stay with Microsoft? Best ways to learn Linux in and out?  

EDIT(if anyone cares! :P): So, I just went ahead and dual booted with Ubuntu. And, I found a way to, quite tediously, to get the RMVXA to work. But, I ran into another problem, and I'm done. I'm just going to keep with the dual boot. :D 

SO, after the six hours it took to finally get RMVXA to work in Wine, I come to find out that the crack I have for the program--I'm not pay 90$ for this program, no matter how much I love it--does work!

THEN! I attempt to play it. CRITICAL ERROR! Lol.

The libs, resources, and exectuables could all be packaged and distributed together. The developer and the user would never have to worry about whether or not the user has dependencies installed; whatever the app needs would be in the bundle.

Now, the course doesn't really go that in depth about how the SSH command works, which is fine, but I want to know more about it.  I've done some reading, but I've still got a few questions.

1. First, for the course the amazon server comes with a domain name, which is the address the SSH uses to connect to the server. Now a domain name is just another way of representing an IP address, so if I wanted, I could find out the servers IP address and type that in to SSH to it, correct?
1. From what I understand computers don't just have one IP address, they have one that connects to the local network, and one that represents the individual machine, right? If that's true, then which one is the domain name mapped to/which do I use to connect?
1. Would it be possible to SSH to the Amazon server, then while there, SSH to the machine I used to SSH to the Amazon server?
1. What all exactly does a computer need to be SSHed into? Just the OpenSSH program? 
1. Keys. I'm a little familiar with how they work, but are they absolutely necessary?

So I installed virtualbox 4.2, along with phpvirtualbox and everything installed fine (after a long ass time of fiddling). So I can connect via phpvirtualbox web gui, and create a new VM etc. The problem is that for some reason in the video settings of the VM the remote display server is missing, which is what I need.

So I try to use the command VBoxManage and turn on the w/ the vrde command and it gives me an error 
&gt;VBoxManage: error: Failed to create the VirtualBox object!
VBoxManage: error: Code NS_BASE_STREAM_WOULD_BLOCK (0x80470007) - Stream operation would block (extended info not available)
VBoxManage: error: Most likely, the VirtualBox COM server is not running or failed to start.

So it turns out , any command that I give vboxmanage results in the same error. what am I doing wrong ?  I have confirmed that the virtualbox com server is running (i think?).. I just started this yesterday and have never setup a VM Server. Any help would be appreciated.

~~Also, bonus. I want to change the default directory of the created VMs to /vbox/blahVMs instead of the ~&lt;userhome&gt;/blahblah which is easy enough to do in phpvirtualbox gui, but not sure where to change it in virtualbox.~~

For whatever reason, phpvirtualbox and VBoxManage like to have different default directories @ where to store the VMs.... I would really like to find the config file that you can edit the default directories of the VMs, at LEAST the default virtual hard-drive directories, so that I can save them on my larger, non /OS  hdd.


Oh. I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and Virtualbox(VBoxManage) v.4.2.12r84980.

This is pretty fun, my archaic server that I bought for dirt cheap seems to be capable of quite a lot, although unfortunately doesn't have VT-x enabled, so I think i'm SOL trying to run a win8 VM, but win7 works.. ubuntu 13.04 did not work initially, 12.04 works.. kind of really slowly.

* Can't run Steam because it wants to install libgl1-mesa-dri:i386 and libgl1-glx-dri:i386 - can't install these because of dependencies and broken packages.

* Can't install recommended packages for ^ because of other dependencies, and so forth.

* Ubuntu always runs 2D session, even if I don't select it. 

* Can't install PlayonLinux - due to dependencies.

Most of the things I've attempted to do to fix these issues (new drivers, installing via terminal, etc.) haven't helped. After some research I've decided it might be easiest just to reinstall and start fresh. I don't have anything important that can't be deleted on my linux partition, so I don't mind losing data.

I've looked for power saving modes and tried disabling everything.  The only thing currently enabled is the screensaver / turn of monitor.  Checked in BIOS setup for any power saving options but there don't seem to be any.

Looking through the logs I don't see anything, everything just seems to stop logging when it goes to sleep.  No events such as ""going to sleep now"".

I recently switched over to ubuntu 12.10 on my hp laptop and I think my computer is running games a little slow.  Before the switch from windows, I could play tf2 reasonably well and league of legends perfectly.  Now, tf2 crashes and dies and league drops to 5 fps when more than 3 players are on the screen.  I've been looking for an obvious fix and of course lowered all my settings and other basic tweaks, but it isn't helping.  It came to my attention that it may be because I am using OSS drivers instead of the proprietary.

So, I am wondering if changing my drivers will help boost my performance, or if it is some other factor that I'm not aware of.  I am especially confused because i have seen other laptops with lower specs play tf2 perfectly, and mine can't manage it (even using native steam and tf2 launcher).  Some system info:

My uses for the computer vary from gaming (mostly Steam/Source games or older stuff like Diablo2/NWN/SC1/Civ4) and surfing the internet

I don't need bleeding edge software, except bumblebee but that's not very bleeding edge any more.

I used to prefer Gnome but its been 5 years now so I could go either way.

All machines involved are CentOS 6.2. I've got a server running SVN that I need to access the repository on it remotely. That is up and running and has been working fine for over a year. I use ssh for authentication, and then svnserv for the authorization. sshd has PubkeyAuthentication yes, and PasswordAuthentication no, set. So you must use a public key. Pretty basic stuff. Heres where it gets weird.

I have a development chassis that was running in our dev lab and so when I worked on it, I would just sit in front the machine and work from the GNOME. I was able to use svn no problem. When I accessed our SVN server, either from subclipse or the command line, it would pop open a dialog on the desktop requesting my passphrase to unlock my public key, I would enter it, and it would dutifully complete it's task.

Recently, the machine had to go to another facility, and I no longer have physical access to it. It is behind a Linux server running as a gateway, so I ssh or NX into that machine that is on the internet, and then ssh into my development chassis. No problems so far. Only issue is that now, when I try to use svn from my development machine, back to my SVN server, it runs through the entire Authentication process, but fails to prompt me for the key to unlock my public key. I tried adding -X to my ssh login but that did not allow the dialog to come through, even though other applications, eclipse for example, work fine through X11 forwarding.

The interesting part is seen when I turn debugging all the way up on ssh with -vvv.  You can see the line 

&gt;debug3: sign_and_send_pubkey 

towards the end. When I am on a machine with a window manager running, this is where it pauses, opens the dialog to unlock my public key, and then continues. here though, it does not do that. It just continues along it's way and fails. 

I'm pretty well stumped at this point. Any suggestions are welcome

I am currently at [Chapter 6.7] (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter06/linux-headers.html) and some inconsistencies with the book have become apparent.  I was hoping somebody could shed some light on this for me.

Ok, so I realised I should have linux-3.5.2.tar.xz so I retrieved that and tried to rebuild.  I still get the same error. Fine, so I check my perl and see that I have */tools/lib/perl5/5.16.1/* as opposed to */tools/lib/perl5/5.14.2/* which linux is looking for.

Do I need to completely rebuild my toolchain with perl5/5.14.2 and linux-3.5.2 or can I somehow get around this issue?  I am guessing I need to start over :O

Thanks for taking the time to look and I appreciate any help.  I know I probably should have adhered strictly to the book but the wget-list provided me with these packages so I just figured they could be used instead of the exact ones in the book.

Unfortunately, I find lots of unix how-tos but not much on individual Operating Systems.

I think the best way for me to learn is to turn an old PC I have laying around into a Unix machine, but I don't know where to start. We use Red Hat, Sun Microsystems Sun OS, Solaris 9, and some sort of Linux. I feel like I could learn on any of them and transfer knowlege with little trouble, but which would be easiest to run on my PC at home? Could I build a unix style network on my LAN at the house to get used to the navigation? Maybe a server to play with, or am I thinking of too much too fast?

I'm already up to my eyeballs in Unix crap at work, so the only limit on what I'm doing is how fast I can actually learn things (old dog, new tricks). Is there a site that can give me a road map to progress through this new and exciting world?

`sudo umount -a` comes up with a load of ""device is busy"", and all the guides I've seen just say to `umount [directory]` which in my case is /, and therefore not a good idea.

I can unmount sda1, but 13s sticks around.  I can't unmount it.  If I remount sda1 with `sudo mount -a`, then unmount 13s, sda1 unmounts, and 13s stays mounted at /.

&gt;This initial post will be updated with information as I remember it, and as you ask questions. I just woke up to my wife yelling at me that her computer has been hacked. There has been some suspicious activity on her laptop while we have been sleeping for the past couple of days, but my wife chalked it up to the cats walking on the keyboard, possibly. This morning she awoke to her desktop with a new background, a file with network settings open, KeyPass was open but not unlocked, and a bank statement opened (I know, time to encrypt.). There was also a new file on the desktop and a new folder on the desktop. Blurry eyed, I didn't think to have her make a screen shot, or ask to see the evidence before she deleted them.
&gt;
Basic info about our set up:
&gt;
Her laptop is running Ubuntu 12
&gt;
Our wifi is WPA2 protected, but the password is relatively weak. It's a passphrase 19 characters long, but all lowercase letters. I actually hope we are being hacked through our wifi, because that really narrows down the list of possible perpetrators.

My laptop is running Ubuntu 12 also, but seems to be untouched, at least in the obvious ways my wife's laptop was.

Further, it has the absolute minimum apps installed for it's purpose. It is running Joomla, which I have to update often, because there always seems to be new security issues that are plugged. Still, it has been defaced often.

The site is very static, so restoring it is trivial. I just replace the V-Server guest folders from backup on the host.

As a simple security measure, what I have done is add a line in the /etc/profile to email me a notification when anyone gets in. Access is SSH only, and not for root. There is a different account for access. The password is strong, and that user name is non-standard.

I know that some cron jobs or simple system stuff executes /etc/profile as root. However, this server has not sent a false-positive 'System Access' notification in years. Now, for root access, there have been 2 in less than 24 hrs. 

I have pretty good sys admin skills, but zero experience when it comes to tracking down a hack. Immediately after getting a 'System Access' email, I went into the system and did a 'users' command. This should have listed only me. However, it listed NOTHING. I find that suspicious.

My guess is some automated script got access somehow, logged out before I got in, and then reported back to 'head office' so someone can hack their way in later.

I have no experience in running an email server so I'm looking for the simplest solution and from a cursory search, I think Zimbra might fit my needs. Though I don't really know if it's suited to operate as a personal email solution.
  
I have a nagging feeling that none of this is possible, but I thought I'd ask anyway just in case.

I installed Tor not too long ago, and since then there has been one update released that I have yet to apply to my browser bundle. The onion icon flashes the yellow icon, and its drop down menu has an option that says ""upgrade Tor Browser Bundle.""

The menu item takes me to Tor's download page, but none of the things available for download say that they're updates; instead, they're all just the full program compressed in tar balls, the same thing I used to first install the program.

I've mainly used apt-get for my installing and upgrading, but Tor required a manual installation, which I figured out with no problem. The upgrading, however, leaves me with a few questions.

Do I have to uninstall Tor and reinstall the newer version? Is there something in the new version's tar ball that I can use to apply an upgrade without reinstalling the whole thing? Am I missing this whole upgrade process entirely?

Does NTFS mean that Firewire is just pointless in this case? 

Edit 2: Well I understand what I need to do now a lot better. The background story is this HDD is part of a research class I started to collect video interviews of veterans, so the other people in the class focus on interviewing and have zero knowledge of Linux. I had been using the desktop I built with Kdenlive to convert the raw .mts files and transfer them to the HDD. Everything I do has to be sustainable after I graduate but we now have the budget for me to build a small mini-server that I'll put Ubuntu server on (our university charges a $1 a gig for backup space). Basically filezilla will be the only thing people have to know how to use. We're going to try to find at least one CS major a semester (most likely an underclassmen)  to maintain the website as their primary goal, so hoping they also know Linux if something goes wrong after I graduate worries me.

The most obvious sign is that the battery icon suddenly appears when I plug the power in, and the power settings don't offer any ""On battery power"" options before that.

I've dug a little deeper, tried running the `acpi` application, and again it shows no sign of battery until the power is plugged in at least once.  Digging further I find that `/sys/class/power_supply` only has an `ACAD` (presumably AC ADapter) node after booting on battery, but as soon as I plug in the power a new node `BAT1` appears.  After this (until the next reboot) things seem normal.

Unfortunately nothing seems to be logged when I insert power, certainly neither `dmesg` nor `/var/log/syslog` show anything.  I'm a bit baffled where to ask for advice on this.  I suspect it's a kernel or even a BIOS issue, for example `dmesg` I see this interesting line:

    ACPI: Battery Slot [BAT1] (battery absent)

Lies!  Here's the `dmesg` output from a recent boot without power adapter plugged in: http://sprunge.us/LXUW .  Interestingly, have just done a further test, and it's a *change* in power adapter state that's required to trigger recognition of the battery.

So I'd be ever so grateful for any pointers for further investigation!

The system in question is running kernel 3.5.0-17-generic (Mint/Ubuntu).  I'd better make some more remarks about the BIOS, because getting Linux installed on this machine was a considerable pain, and I've had to switch the BIOS into some kind of degraded compatibility mode.

Alas, this machine came with Secure Boot enabled, and it initially took me two hours to figure out how to turn it off: just to put you off the scent, all secure boot configuration settings are disabled until you set a BIOS password!  Yeah, right, I *always* do that.  Ok, so I've had to configure all of these changes to get the system to boot Linux:

1. Set BIOS password
2. Set Secure Boot to Disabled
3. Disable Fast Boot (shows BIOS splash screen)
4. Enable CSM (Compatibility Support Module)

The BIOS in question appears to be called ""Phoenix SecureCore Tiano"".  If, for instance, I omit step 4 I get the message ""Bootable device was not found.""  Am inclined to suspect the BIOS isn't playing nice with me.

GRUB is working fine, and that's what I see when I start up the computer. I can select Windows 8 from there and boot into it.

If I select Windows 7, the computer reboots, I select Windows 8 from the GRUB menu - and then Windows 7 boots.

So essentially, I have to boot Windows 8 and restart if I want to boot Windows 7.

So my question is, is there a way I can move whatever Windows 8 is doing and have both Windows 7 and Windows 8 show in the GRUB menu and boot from there?

* processor: i7-3632QM
* memory: 8 GB RAM
* HD: 750 GB

As many of you know, they made it a bitch and a half to install install linux on Win8 machines... I have downloaded Ubuntu 64bit and made a bootable USB drive, but when I try and boot from it I get a message that says ""no operating system found"". Suggestions?

Thanks everyone :)

**EDIT**
 
I was only able to successfully install via a CD. Here are the steps I followed for my particular system:

(1) Download and burn a copy of Ubuntu 64 bit iso image to a CD/DVD

(2) Create a backup of Win8 (if your computer didn't come with a cd like mine didn't)

(2) In BIOS do the following (hold f2 on restart):
 
  * BOOT menu: Disable Fast Boot, Enable Launch CSM
  * SECURITY menu: Disable Secure Boot Control
  * Save settings/restart

(3) in BIOS (again, hold f2 while restarting):
 
   * Navigate to BOOT, change it so that your optical drive is in the top position
   * put in CD with Ubuntu 64 bit and restart

These steps allowed me to install Ubuntu successfully on my machine... however, I can't seem to boot up Win8 yet... but I think I have to do something within Ubuntu to change that. 

Hopefully this helps someone!

Also, if I'm giving terrible advice let me know - I'm new to this :P

I recently noticed a problem where if I use the touchpad's mouse buttons to click anything, the entire system will freeze forcing me to reset with the power button itself.  Usually this will happen on the login screen, but can also cause freezes shortly after login.  Very rarely, I will be able to login for about half a minute but while using some program I will suddenly be logged out and on the login screen again.
Using the trackpoint and its buttons has no freezing effect.  In fact, if I can successfully login and use the trackpoint exclusively for a while, the mouse buttons of the touchpad become usable again.  
I have been trying to research this and the only possible connection I can find is the possibility of xorg crashing being the cause.
The only link I could possibly think of in terms of changes to my system and xorg crashing is that I recently installed a newer Sandy Bridge graphics driver via the http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu precise main repo (the one suggested by Steam).

For example, I'm having some issues with an NFS shared volume on Server A. It's not mission critical, and there's another more urgent thing I need to finish on Server B. Server B mounts that NFS share from Server A. For whatever reason I need to reboot Server B.

I know Server B can't mount that share from Server A during boot time. I don't care, because I don't need that NFS mount right now. So I wait for it to come back up, but.. it doesn't. I can ping it 'till the cows come home, no response. What happened? 

I bring up the Remote Console and find that Linux tells me it can't mount that volume and then stopped booting. I don't need that volume. Can I just continue booting? No? Why the hell not? So I need to log into ""rescue mode"", remount root to be read-write (as rescue mode always mounts root as read only), edit the fstab file, and then reboot. Finally I can go back to work!

I know I should have edited the fstab file before rebooting. But I forgot. It's a real easy mistake to make. It's not specific to NFS shares either. Maybe I'm currently fixing a problem with a mount that won't work, try to give it a reboot for whatever reason and DAMN I forgot to remove it from the fstab file again.

Why can't I just tell it to continue booting? I know if it's a critical volume I'll just run into an error later, but isn't that up to me to decide?

Is there any switch in the fstab file to tell it a mount is optional? Or a secret button combination to tell it ""BOOT YOU MOFO, I DONT NEED THAT MOUNT!""?

It's a dream of mine to be recognized as a Red Hat Certified Sysadmin and I'd be on cloud 9 if I could one day be an RHC Engineer. I bought Michael Jang's RHCSA/RHCE cert study guide and after going through both Red Hat's course objectives and perusing the book, I'm pretty confident if I put my mind to it I can eventually conquer RHCSA. 

The only thing is taking -just- the RHCSA exam is $400 dollars. I'm happy to pay for the chance, but I'd like to know from some of you out there who've done this what to expect and if I can do this without the classes.

Fast forward to me working on that same machine. I had to gather some info off the hard-drive, so I used Knoppix. I powered on the machine, looked up the info on the hard-drive, and used ""poweroff"" to shut-down. And then nothing. I couldn't reboot. It had indeed wiped out the BIOS on the SBC.

So I have been an exclusive user of linux for the past 4 years or so. I love it. Sometimes it can be a challenge, and sometimes it can take some time to find the right tool for the task. However to me it is worth it and think that the average quality of my work (writing, images whatever) is higher with linux. I value freedom, the ability to look at the source-code, the non-proprietary text based formats that are so common, and the incredible infrastructure for tech support. 

Some tasks take longer, but mostly I have just forgotten how terrible and slow it can be to use windows. In general I am opposed to SAAS, but sometimes I just have to use it.

However this fall I just returned to school, and am struggling to avoid the pressure to use proprietary software. For example I have to work in a group on a project. Everyone uses microsoft word, and even though in an ideal world I would use some form of distributed vcs and a text-based markup,  I can't tell these people that struggle to use gui-apps that they are doing things wrong, and besides if they are that means *everyone* is doing things wrong which is somewhat difficult to convince them of. I speak of freedom and choice but these things don't seem important to them *at all*. 

I have a professor who requires work to be submitted in .docx (strongly suggested) or pdf, and who returns the assignments with comments which only are readable in adobe's/microsoft's software. Every time I turn something in as a pdf I also feel guilty. Should I just dual-boot and relearn microsoft's tools (since these are often required by jobs etc....), or stick to my guns? How do you guys handle situations like this?

Edit 2: I'm compiling an ongoing list of laptops I've been told are good with ubuntu:

* [Ohava](http://www.ohava.com) - Custom built with ubuntu (among others) preinstalled. Quite cheap for their power. I'd never even head of this company before. Quality unknown.

* [Lenovo T Series](http://shop.lenovo.com/gbweb/gb/en/notebooks/thinkpad/t-series) - UK site. Price curve is quite steep and they all come with Windows 7 preinstalled. I have yet to hear anyone (here or anywhere else) say anything bad about them as a laptop. High quality.

* [Dell](http://search.euro.dell.com/results.aspx?s=gen&amp;c=uk&amp;l=en&amp;cs=&amp;k=ubuntu&amp;cat=all) - Search results for 'Ubuntu' from the UK website. There's a lot more choice than there was a few years ago. The [Dell outlet](http://www.dell.co.uk/outlet) isn't bad either, if a bit hit and miss. No idea if the Microsoft tax applies to these. Questionable quality (from my experience).

Checked the above brands against the list provided by Canonical ( [http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/](http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/) ), and Dell is the clear winner, but it's a work in progress and only checks to see if Ubuntu works, not if the laptops do.

WinAmp solves my needs perfectly on windows, so let me list a bit what I'm looking for: 

* A reasonable queuing system that lets me queue an album after my current album is done. Banshee queues after the current song, which is great if you don't care about what you were previously listening to, but I *do* care
* Last.fm scrobbling.
* FLAC support
* Browsing by Album Artist. (And preferably some sort of browse by album-art pane) Seriously, I'm surprised at the number of players that don't have this feature.
* Tag management that doesn't suck. Doesn't have to be anything fancy like Gracenote querying, but a clean way to manually edit bad tags 
* A bit prettier of a theme than Banshee. Not required, but would be nice.
* Management of simple SD-card based music players. Again not entirely required since most of my management I do from my Windows tower, but would be nice
* Not KDE. The UI should be native to GNOME.

I have an old router that is sitting around and it has OpenWRT on it which is a linux distro for routers.

I was thinking of a bunch of things i can do with this and got a couple of ideas.

First of all the router has a JTAG and a serial port that can be used for IO, so using this i suppose that it must be possible to make a circuit that will turn switches on and off. What i am thinking is that i put a bunch of relays that can be controlled by the serial port, and use each of them on the lights in my room, effectively controlling all the lights tirelessly from my computer.

That is just the begging, i once i can control relays from it i think the possibilities are endless.

I am not really familiar with how a serial port works, except in basic theory, but ideally if it was possible the convert the parallel output then i could use the 1/0 value of each wire to control a relay. 

My question is:

1 - How much programming will this really need? it does look kind of simple but again i am really not sure.

2 - Does a serial to parallel converter exist? can i get it easily on the market? can i build it myself?

3 - Has anyone done something like this before? any tips and stuff would be helpful.

On a completely unrelated note, any good suggestions for books on IPtables, QOS, firewalls stuff would be most welcome (beginner level ofcourse).",,False,,t5_2rbms,False,,,True,t3_gw7vo,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/gw7vo/using_a_router_to_make_life_easier_project/,

Usually you're having to deal with compressed log files in addition to the current log file. You end up with a command to uncompress and cat the archives:

    bzcat `find . -newer debug.log-20110306.bz2 -name ""debug.log*""`

And then a command to cat the most recent file.

    cat debug.log

Say I'm counting appearances of a certain pattern across both the archives and the current file, such that it'd be ideal to have the outputs of both commands go to the same grep/awk/sort chain.

I get the feeling I should be able to do this from the command line without having to write a .sh file just to do one after the other, or write both outputs to a file and work on that. However, &amp;&amp;-ing the commands together doesn't maintain STDOUTs to the grep (or the rest of the command chain), nor does separating them with semicolons. 

The best I've found is to write a Perl script that simply echoes STDIN, and then executes something immediately afterward.

    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    use strict;
    use warnings;

    while( &lt;STDIN&gt; ) {
        print( $_ );
    }

    if( @ARGV ) {
        system( @ARGV );
    }

Such that I'd call it like:

    bzcat `find . -newer debug.log-20110306.bz2 -name ""debug.log*""` | echo.then.call.pl cat debug.log | grep ... | awk ...

I intend on staying with 10.04 as it is a LTS and I prefer the stability - with a moderate mix of PPAs and backports.

So I have the following worries:

1. will flash work?

2. will codecs for various video formats work? I've seen there is a w64codes (equivalent to w32codecs I guess)

3. will java plugin work - I need it for web banking, I've seen that openjdk is substituted for sun-java6 - will sun-java still be an option?

4. will vmware player work  - I need it for some specific work I do.

Other than that I can live with some things not being there.

* How does the Linux scheduler work? How does a process sharing a processor with ohter processes manages to control them/take control (if they stop responding) ?

-I have dual screens and a GTX 295

-I'm an avid Conky user and will one running on the desktop (I will of course be rewriting it to fit the new environment)

-Arch Linux user - I like very organized and uncluttered desktops. 

Currently I am looking at KDE as a candidate - how has KDE been faring in the past couple years? Last I checked KDE 4 was the new thing and people were still whining about Unity, so I really have no idea. All I know is that it has a reputation for being very good looking - I really like transparent windows. 

The other one I am looking at is Enlightenment, but I don't know nearly as much about it as I should. I just remember seeing a friend of mine's setup a year ago and liking it.

I've always wanted to move from Windows over to a Linux distro, but certain things have kept me from doing it. For the most part it's because I'm simply not willing to give up a lot of the Windows software. I want to ask you all how you dealt with it because I'm sure others have faced the same dilemma earlier.

The software I need and which I haven't been able to find proper replacement for is:

* Microsoft Office (Excel, Word, PowerPoint)
* Adobe Photoshop CS6 *(Adobe Illustrator)*
* ~~Adobe~~ ~~After~~ ~~Effects~~
* ~~Sony~~ ~~Vegas~~
* iTunes (As much as I hate it)


Currently these programs are the only thing keeping me locked to Windows. I'm hoping someone can shed some light as to how they dealt with the transition, or if they have other programs that can take over and bring the same level of professionalism as the ones they're replacing. Almost all comparisons of Microsoft Office to LibreOffice for example have been focused on how they look and feel similar, but LibreOffice is FREE! The price is not a sticking point for me, I need something that retains the functionality of the real thing. This is also why Gimp is no replacement for Photoshop.

I know I'm being extremely demanding, but that doesn't mean that I'm not open to alternatives. Also, I assume many of you have been using Linux for years and if there is one group of people I'm sure can help me, it would be you guys!

Thanks in advance for any and all help. If I'm not being precise enough, just ask, and I'll clarify :)

---

**EDIT:**

Hello again and thanks for all the replies! Like /u/ezarcs pointed out, a little more info would probably be welcome:

I'll try to clarify:

Photoshop is necessary since I do occasional web development and creating icons and backgrounds are a must. I would also need Adobe Illustrator, but I assume that if I can get Photoshop, I'd be able to get Illustrator.

I haven't looked very closely at LibreOffice, but when I do, it seems like their main selling point is the price and licensing rather than the functionality. I'm sure it's a good replacement for Word, but how does it compare in functionality to Excel (think macros, VLOOKUP, charts, etc.)? Also, there's the issue that almost all sources of information are focused on hating Microsoft. This is not a good enough reason to switch, when Microsoft makes perfectly good software and more importantly, is the market standard.

I'll take the After Effects and Sony Vegas off the list since they're not as crucial as the others.

After reboot, I couldn't log in, or possibly before reboot and I just didn't notice because I hadn't logged out.

After entering my password into the lightdm login screen, x seems to fail and show me a flicker of an underlying console.

I have searched for a solution, but all the solutions I could come up with were related directly with Gnome 2, Unity, or some other such desktop... uh... shell?

Thank you!


----
Hello! So I was able to do this by the combined answers here. Yay!

I followed Hello71's instructions and some of the others as well.

In my Linux machine:
mkdir ~/.ssh || true
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
touch ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

In my Windows machine:
**1.** Using PuttyGen, click Load and I loaded my existing private key
**2.** Conversions-&gt;Export OpenSSH and export your private key
**3.** Copy private key to ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Back to my Linux machine:
**4. Create the RFC 4716 version of the public key using ssh-keygen**
ssh-keygen -e -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa_com.pub

After #4, I encountered an error that says: 

WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!

Permissions 0744 for '/home/gotninjaskills/.ssh/id_rsa' are too open.
It is recommended that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
bad permissions: ignore key: /home/gotninjaskills/.ssh/id_rsa

To fix:
I reset the permissions by doing:
sudo chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

**5. The last step is:**
Convert the RFC 4716 version of the public key to the OpenSSH format:
ssh-keygen -i -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa_com.pub &gt; ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

EDIT: In response to Kaurin: it's not the anti-virus. I'm getting ""The specified server cannot perform the requested operation"" when logging on as an smb user. When trying to log on as guest, I'm getting ""System Error 1240 has occurred: The account is not authorized to log in from this station."" That's if I use net use. If I try to log on as guest from ""Map Network Drive"" it just keeps demanding credentials over and over again.

In response to others: The relevant sections of my smb.conf are now identical to mayupvoterandomly's, with the force guest and guest only taken out. The win 7 machine that has no problems connecting as an smb user also has no problems connecting as guest. I'm 99.9% sure that smb.conf is configured correctly and that both errors are related to some bs in Windows. I've gone into both regedit and the local policy editor and allowed unencrypted passwords. Not that these are enabled on the working machine, but that's what Microsoft suggests the second error is caused by when connecting to a third party smb server.

Edit 2: Here's the log file from Samba for [connecting as guest](http://thebardingreen.info/files/bpws62.log) and for connecting as a [samba user](http://thebardingreen.info/files/bpws62asadmin.log).

Edit 3: Response to wenestvedt.  Yes, the log shows it failing to find user ""guest"" but -why- does guest log on work fine on the other machine?  Also, trying to logon with ""net use m: \\10.1.10.9\MOM /user:nobody"" also produces the ""not authorized from this workstation"" error.

Edit 4: I got it working, connecting as guest.  Turned out to be a dumb Windows policy issue.  The original error remains unsolved, but solving it just became very non-urgent.

",ArtistEngineer,11,1,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/19nkm8/device_drivers_where_is_the_documentation_for/,"Is there a document that tells me what all the arguments are for in the function pointers?

LDD3 sort of covers this, but not enough and it's out of date.

e.g.

In [LDD3](http://www.makelinux.net/ldd3/chp-3-sect-3):

    int (*fsync) (struct file *, struct dentry *, int);

&gt; This method is the back end of the fsync system call, which a user calls to flush any pending data. If this pointer is NULL, the system call returns -EINVAL.
    


while the [latest kernel defines](http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/include/linux/fs.h#L1530) it as:

    int (*fsync) (struct file *, loff_t, loff_t, int datasync);

So it's different, and I understand the kernel does that and why it does it, but I can't find anything that tells me what the new /different arguments are.

Surely it must be documented somewhere? I really don't like guessing, I'd like to have a definitive answer and reference to what these arguments are for.

**Background:**

I'm writing and documenting how to write a device driver for a company and I'm at a complete loss to tell them how to find this information. I'm trying to win hearts and minds, and show them that Linux has value, but it's embarrassing when I can't demonstrate that Linux has complete or up-to-date documentation for one of the most valuable structs needed to write a device driver.

I know the usual way is to look at existing drivers and just to ""work it out"". But I don't feel that it's professional to tell people to go and look at code and work it out for themselves. They can go and buy embedded Windows, they can go to MSDN and read the API.

Existing code isn't a canonical reference because existing code can have errors, and it varies between implementations.

This software allows the speakers of Serbian language (and the likes of it) to seamlessly type the letters šćčđž. 

The way it normally works on Windows (and Linux for that matter) is that you have to add a Serbian keyboard layout and these letters replace the brackets, semicolon, and apostrophe letters on the keyboard. That's all nice and good, but since I use both English and Serbian constantly, I find the need to switch keyboard layouts (even with shortcuts) tiresome.

Now, the way Srpskey does it is that it automatically replaces sx with š, cx with č, cq with ć and zx with ž. Since there are no words in Serbian that start with any of those two letters, and barely any in English, this works out beautifully. Replacing is fast and seamless, so I don't even pay attention to it.

I currently have an Ubuntu 12.04 server set up with various services running, Samba, SSH, rtorrent (with rutorrent) etc. On this box, I also have an OpenVPN client setup to connect on boot. Everything works great, but I'm looking for ways to ensure that rtorrent can't send any data across any connection other than tun0 and lo for scgi/rutorrent. 

My concern is that if the VPN connection is lost or if an IP address is reported incorrectly, rtorrent will 'leak' outside of the VPN and that activity may become visible to my ISP in the clear. My VPN provider has been extremely reliable, but I'm moving and the connection in the new environment is somewhat unreliable. If the primary ISP connection fails, then the OpenVPN connection fails but the ISP returns, that leaves the potential for rtorrent to communicate outside of the confines of the VPN. To make it more complicated, I want to make sure other services are still available on eth0 such as samba, apache, etc. 

I have zero experience with iptables and I'm not entirely sure it's the right way to go about the job. Should I try to confine rtorrent's outbound and inbound ports on the host with a combination of blocking at the router to prevent leakage, or would it be more appropriate (or even possible) to bind rtorrent to tun0?

A few days ago he upgraded to 12.04 using the update manager. Now he cannot perform any root actions. It gives him the password prompt, but nothing he enters will work, nor will it work by leaving it blank.

Keep in mind, I'm not sure exactly how he did any of this. He uses terminology I'm not familiar with and has never touched the unix command line in his life, so I suspect it's a bug from upgrading to 12.04.

My question is: What can I look into next time I visit? Should I just boot the live CD and edit the root password file and change it to something? Will it need a fresh reinstall? I just want a brainstorm of ideas (pretty please?) since I don't have his machine right here to work on.

I'd like to move as much as I can over to the command line though.  I'm a touch typer, and grew up on the dos command line so I'm familiar in the environment.  However, there are a couple of little niggles that I'd like to get out of the way.

First; browser.  What are some good command line browsers?  I use Links, but is there any way to get framebuffer graphics on a command line browser?  Maybe some javascript support, etc?  What command line browsers do you recommend?

Reddit client?  I've seen some reddit command line clients, is this worth even doing?

Text editor? - I'm not very comfortable with vi yet.  I use nano for editing normally, Is there anything that's more similar to the GUI environment where I can use alt + f to get a file menu, etc?  I'm not averse to learning vi, but it's taking me a little longer than I'd like.  I haven't figured out how to copy and paste things from one file to the next very elegantly. (read: at all)

What about multiple apps at the same time?  Do I use screen for this?  I'm starting to get familiar with it, is there something that others prefer?

Console highlighting - worth doing?

I'm using Wicd-curses right now to manage networks, that seems to work out perfect.  Any way of keeping data on-screen most of the time like battery, time, etc?

Is it possible to do 90% of everything in the command line? - the reason I'm kind of submerging myself into this is because I really need to be familiar with remote-control of linux shells.  I saw a command line ""window manager"" - it was similar to dwm, or...based off of it I think?

Either way, I appreciate any help anyone can give me.  The more familiar with the command line I can be, the more happy I'll be.  One day I might even be a sed/awk guru.

Edit: also, is there a way to get a higher resolution framebuffer?  I did vga=ask in menu.lst, had it scan for more codes, and I only get 800x600x32 as my highest available option.  I guess there might be a way to start X with a full screen terminal for higher resolution maybe?

I installed this adapter card &amp; my SATA HDD in the Dimension &amp; the PC booted right into Ubuntu Linux and seemed to be working just fine at first.

However, shortly thereafter the computer started randomly rebooting. There didn't seem to be any pattern to this rebooting. I thought it might be a bad power supply so I replaced the power supply but the lockups/reboots were still happening.

Then I started to think it might be an issue w/ the RAM. So bought 2 sticks of 512Mg and installed them. Memtesh should both modules were good &amp; working properly. Still crashed randomly.

Running off an Ubuntu 9.10 Live CD seemed to work well enough. But then tried installing both Ubuntu 9.10 &amp; 10.10 and in both cases the installation got all the way through. But when the install said to reboot the PC, I got a string of error messages about a Buffer I/O error. The only way I can use the Net is to run directly from the CD.

What I would like to do is tell him to enter a command, something like

Every time I boot the installation, I get [these error messages](http://i.imgur.com/IfkUEzy.jpg), and then everything freezes (I must do a forced shut down).

Now, I’ve tried almost everything I found on the Arch Forums, I’ve tried almost all of the options [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/USB_Installation_Media) (From Writing to a USB with dd from Ubuntu running in Virtualbox, to booting with Arch loaded in the RAM). Hell, I’ve even dug up some CDs to burn the ISO, with no luck. The installation boots fine on my laptop, so no problem with the installation media. Also, I’ve tried to create a [UEFI bootable USB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface#Create_UEFI_bootable_USB_from_ISO), but every time I try to boot into it, I get the error message that the USB isn’t bootable.
But, the problem does not seem to be Arch specific. I can’t boot the installers for many other Linux distributions (the links bring to screenshots):

# [**Ubuntu 12.04**](http://i.imgur.com/qUGWQK6)
# [**Trisquel**](http://i.imgur.com/6bOvJjQ.jpg)
# [**#!**](http://i.imgur.com/IkjlxBZ.jpg)

With a little research, I’ve determined my troubles are maybe caused by the wonderful UEFI. And, like I said earlier, I’ve tried booting the installer in UEFI mode, with no luck. And yes, secure boot is disabled.

But one thing eludes me: I have an official Ubuntu 10.10 CD (Got one when Canonical was giving them for free) at home, and I can boot into live mode without any problems (Well, almost. Gparted keeps crashing). I haven’t tried to install it, but at least it boots into live mode, which Ubuntu 13.04 (and 12.04) fails to. [Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/MkI1d).

So now I am lost. I definitely want to install Arch Linux alongside Windows 7. I don’t want to give up, that’s what they want me to do. I don’t really mind getting my hands dirty, it is my passion.

So my questions for you are:

1. **What is causing all of this?**
2. **How can I fix this?**

Here are my computer specs:

Type|Part
:----|:----
**CPU** | Intel Core i5-3570k @3.5GHz
**Motherboard** | ASRock z77 Extreme4
**Video Card** | GeForce GTX 460 768MB from MSI

**Operating System** | Windows 7 (64-bit)

If the question wasn’t properly asked, or if you need any additional details, please ask, I won’t *byte*. Thanks for the help.

Edit: It seems that my motherboard has a SATA controller (ASM1061) that does not support ATAPI commands.

#[Answer](http://askubuntu.com/a/232149) by Eric Carvalho: 

&gt;I just built a new computer and bumped into the same issue - and found an answer to it.
&gt;
&gt;Most people seem to have symptoms of slow boot-up times, but I could not boot 90% of the times. When the system did boot, it seemed to work. If you do manage to boot, you should be able to trigger the problem with command: `/lib/udev/ata_id --export /dev/sr0`. Beware, if that truly is the problem, your system will freeze.
&gt;
&gt;The command will send an ATAPI command to the optical drive. The problem is, the SATA controller (ASM1061 in your case) does not support these ATAPI commands, resulting in a frozen system.
&gt;
&gt;There are two solutions to the issue:
&gt;
&gt;1. Edit the file `/lib/udev/rules.d/60-persistent-storage.rules`.
&gt;Find the line containing word ""ATAPI"".
&gt;Comment out the next line.
&gt;This way, udev will not touch ATAPI.
&gt;
&gt;2. Change the SATA port for the optical drive. I used this method, as booting any Linux other than one with the modified udev rule results in freeze otherwise.

&gt;In my case, the motherboard is ASRock Z77 Extreme4 with the same ASMedia ASM1061 chip for two SATA3 ports. I had a DVD drive in one of them and got the error. Switched the DVD drive to a SATA port handled by the Z77 chip and everything works.

I used solution 2.

1. What editor/compiler should I use to begin learning C++ from the ground?

2. Is there a better Distro than Ubuntu for this? I do not mind changing, and will probably only use this laptop for interwebs and learning to program.

So, I was able, finally, after lots of reading and hours invested after work+school, to install a headless Ubuntu 12.10 on my Athlon3500 w/ 1Gb ram from 2006 and install samba to serve files to my windows machines and plex to serve my media collection to my ps3.

I installed Ubuntu on the 200GB hdd, and then added a 1TB and created a LVM so my media folder is 750GB and can be expanded. After making all of this mess, everything is running and working ok, a bit slow sometimes, but it's working, I just found out some days ago that if one of the disks would have some failure, I would loose everything on them BOTH? 
Is this true? 

I have a 3TB NTFS disk where I made a copy of ALL the contents of the media files on the server (videos, pictures, etc etc.) And I keep it in a dry, secure, dust-vibration-free place.

I took the decision to change to linux as one day about 1 month ago the lights went out at home and my laptop, ps3 and old pc with xp went corrupted and I had to recover all the files from each one of them and after reading that ext3 &amp;4 are solid file systems, I decided to give it a try.

I wanted to use the server to host my personal webpage, and to be able to access from the outside e.g. at friend's place or when I am on a trip to secure all the new docs+pictures on it remotely.

But after reading that if the hdd's are not server intended, then they will eventually fail (one of them is 7 year old and the 1 TB one is about 2 years old with not much use, turn on and hours is really low) killing with their death all of my last 10+ years memories.

How can I make a better use of the 3TB disk? (I intend to use it as raid, but atm the old mobo has no more free sata connectors).


Or what would you reccomend me to do? To have a copy of all the stuff and still use the LVM? (to use all the space if required). I have this at the moment, but when I connect the 3TB to my linux laptop, not all of the files get recognized (jpg, gif, avi, etc)? Do you have any input on this?

Sorry for the wall of text, but after all the long nights invested on it, I am scared of letting it run overnight atm and I am still not able yet to host my webpage (I want to show fam+friends my picture galleries).

TL;DR: Home server ubuntu (12.10) install with 2 hdd's (200GB + 1TB) in LVM and scared of loosing everything in case of failure, how to proceed?

I've tried googling but it doesn't help that much. Basically, I want to learn how to deal with servers both remotely and locally, and want to use it in the mean time. Since I'm a student I can't afford hardware needed for a server so I'll be improvising. Now, for this price range I can afford a desktop, which I will instal a server CentOS or openSUSE server, I'm wondering which CPU I'm better off for it.
Usage of this server will be file sharing, hosting a LAN website (practicing web development) and webinterface, database hosting, maybe for testing server-side java applications, torrenting, running a Minecraft server and possibly remotely using applications with X server.

Which of these CPUs can handle all this and roughly how much is the difference between them?

* AMD Athlon II 160u @1.8 GHz, 1MB L2 cache
* AMD Dual-Core Zacate E350 @1.6Ghz, 1MB L2
* AMD Dual-Core Sempron X2 190 @2.5Ghz, 2x512kb

* Intel® Atom™ Processor D2500 (1M Cache, 1.86 GHz)
* Intel® Celeron® Dual-Core G530 @2.4Ghz, 2MB

My question is just to make sure that I am understanding this setup correctly and possibly get any insight from someone who has tried this.

With VT-D I would be able to run the laptop on the Intel Integrated Graphics and then run a game within virtualization with full access to the dedicated video card via VT-D IOMMU for games that are Windows only, otherwise I could use Bumble Bee to specifically turn on the Nvidia Card for specific programs while generally only using the Intel for basic needs.

* SSD 128 GB: Grub dual booting Ubuntu 12.04 + Windows 7

* HDD1 1 TB: Storage - media, movies, files, VMs etc

* HDD2 500GB: Grub dual booting CentOS + Ubuntu 12.10 (atm)

* I was thinking of just using some unpartitioned space on HDD2 and 12.10 as the Host OS but are there other things I need to consider? I believe all neccessary packages/dependencies are available in debian repos or from an 'LFS tarball'

* The Ubuntu 12.10 installation is just for testing and trying things out, it is entirely expendable.  Does anyone have any recommendation for a host OS to begin with that would be better suited or less prone to running into issues?

* Will it be possible to 'transplant' or make an image of the resulting LFS  system, or will it be tied to the machine/hardware on which it was compiled/created? Basically if I want to recreate the system on a different machine will I have to build it from *scratch* again?

* Ideally I would like to do this on a local server via ssh but I realise at some point there is a handoff between the Host and LFS systems so is this a feasible method or am I just overcomplicating my first attempt?

Also I'm not a total beginner in bash scripting and would like to take this opportunity to improve my skill.



My first step would be to have a script that would get a word from a file. Each word would be on their own line, the script would pick a line at random* and print the word on screen. Then at the press of a button another word would be printed, etc. Sometimes there can be more than one word per line and I predict spaces will give me headaches. *^actually ^not ^completely ^random ^but ^more ^evenly ^distributed.

Could you hint me how to do this please?

A slightly more complex script that I could envision would be: each words is associated with it's translation, on the same line separated by a character (tabulation?) The first button press gives the word, the second gives the translation. I hope to be able to figure it out once I have done the first script. Bonus point: this is Hindi I'm learning so my vocabulary list would ultimately have devanagari characters alongside latin characters (I'm still learning with romanised words but I'll have to make the jump someday)

Now that I'm writing this post I'm thinking of something even more awesome: after the translation is shown, the user is asked if he got it right (y/n). Based on this input the incorrect words should come back more often. The correct words should not stop to be randomly picked though. Maybe store some statistics in another file? I'd like not to pollute my word list. On this one I'm absolutely clueless.

Can reddit help me on this?

I watch hulu and other video sites by hooking my laptop up to a Sony Bravia HD tv via hdmi connection. 

One of (only) advantages of using the Windows partition is that whenever I hook the laptop to the tv, the laptop display automatically changes to the correct aspect ratio and the tv screen mirrors the laptop screen. In the Ubuntu partition,I think that it's detecting the tv as another monitor rather than as a tv, so I get a dual monitor display, which I don't want! 

I think this is the relevant information from the lspci command:

(NOTE: this isn't universal for all laptops, but you can also go to the display settings and select the option to ""mirror display"". This doesn't, however, solve my problem, as I'm about to explain.)

Mirror display is in 4:3 aspect ratio and only fills up part of the tv screen.

I wrote about this a year ago, and got great help, but unfortunately, I didn't manage to finish the job.

I am trying to test my own serial port driver. I can compile the module, but I can't load it into the kernel. It says the I/O range is already reserved.

I have tried building a kernel that doesn't have serial port support. Unfortunately, this seems nightmarishly impossible. While I use make menuconfig, certain serial port drivers simply cannot be disabled. I can only choose built-in or module. For instance, SERIAL_CORE is required by X86, which seems to be pretty basic (generic X86 support?).

I have spent a lot of time in there trying to disable everything that can be close to a serial driver, yet, somehow, some module or built-in driver always ends up creating the ttyS0 and ttyS1 devicesand reserving the resources. 

I have tried finding out which driver is responsible for those devices, but I hit a dead end. The driver is identified simply as ""serial"". I don't know which module or build-in feature is responsible for it, so I can't find a way to disable it and free the I/O range.
I tried looking at the dependencies in make menuconfig, but nothing is named ""serial"", and everyhing that even resembles serial_blablabla or UART_blablabla is disabled.

A previous build I had made was lucky, and I had the serial drivers as modules. I could unload them, but it didn't seem to be enough, the serial device would simply not behave normally to I/O queries after I loaded my driver (the LCR won't reset it's values upon reading, for instance). I need them to just never ever load with the kernel.

The I/O range is reserved by ""serial"" (/sys/devices/pnp0/00:06/).
I am getting quite frustrated with this, any help would be greatly appreciated.

**TL;DR
How can I find out which module is responsible for ttyS0/ttyS1, and build a kernel that never creates these devices when it boots?**

Can somebody talk me through it like I'm 5 please? I have another NTSC partition on the External that I don't want to lose so I'm nervous. 

Edit: Thanks for all you help. I now have my external partition copied (not cloned) onto my internal, and running, hopefully properly. Here's how I did it:

I reinstalled Ubuntu with a separate home partition, booted into the live disc again, used gParted to resize the external partition and copy it, then pasted it to sda1 location (it was sdb7). 

I then ran 

sudo blkid 

In terminal, copied the UUID of sda1 then ran 

Sudo gedit /media/(the id of my internal root found by hovering over it in the home folder)/etc/fstab

Selected the UUID of the sda1 /home and pasted in the one from sudo blkid then saved it

Booted into my internal hdd with the external one unplugged, got my wallpaper, typed up this thankyou.

I have two interfaces in an Ubuntu server: eth0 is connected to the the rest of the network and can access the internet. eth1 is connected via crossover cable to a windows box that I need to VNC into. The windows box has no other way of accessing the network or internet because the facility does not have/will not install a network drop for the windows box, and switches are not allowed on the network. So, basically I have a room with one network port and two machines that I need to access remotely.

My current /etc/network/interfaces that allows me to connect to the windows box from the Ubuntu server is as follows (public IP address/gateway obscured by x's):

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
	netmask 255.255.254.0
	gateway xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

# Interface for windows box

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
	address 10.10.10.9
	netmask 255.255.255.0

Now, I would like for the eth1 interface to be bridged with eth0 so the windows box can access the internet for time synchronization. I've already got masquerading/forwarding enabled in the firewall &amp; sysctl, so now I just need to put the correct config in /etc/network/interfaces, but I can't seem to get it and I haven't found a solution via *the Google*. Can anyone give me a push in the right direction? Thanks!

***Update &amp; Resolution***

I did get the bridge working following the Debian documentation (http://wiki.debian.org/BridgeNetworkConnections ,thanks aaron416!), but due to aggressive packet filtering on the network, I still couldn't communicate with the Internet (pings would come back ""filtered by: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"", xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx being the firewall's IP).

Ultimately, I just went back to my original working config with the two separate subnets, and went along the lines of the idea that came from Ketsman's advice by setting up the Ubuntu box as an NTP server (since windows has always been able to see the Ubuntu box, just not beyond it). At first, windows wouldn't sync due to ""The peer's stratum is less then the host stratum."" but this was solved by having the Ubuntu machine get its time updates from time.nist.gov instead of ntp.ubuntu.com.

Minecraft on my Mint x64 install is horribly laggy. I average around 15 FPS on low-draw distance and low graphics. I know that it's not my system, for I get around 100 FPS in Win7. Core 2 1.8ghz, 2gb ram, gt 335m graphics, 60gb SSD.

I've read that Java is very RAM hungry, so I went ahead and ordered a 4gb stick to bring me up to 5gb once I install it in 3 days. But 'free' shows that w/o minecraft open I have ~200mb of free ram at any time, and with it open I have ~20mb of free ram w/ AT MAX ~30mb of swap usage. And the swap is currently on my SSD (ikno, super bad practice), so that shouldnt really slow it down more than a hair. So for some reason I don't think RAM is the issue, but I could be wrong.

It seems to run a wee bit better with the -Xmx512M command, but the FPS above is with that enabled and it's still unplayable. Another possibility is that, right now, I cant install the official nvidia drivers for the gt335m card from the mint repo. My entire install will crash upon next reboot when I do. I've attempted it several times, none have resulted in a working OS after reboot. It starts booting but then gets stuck on ""Checking Battery State"". My research has indicated that this means it's getting stuck on launching the X-Server, since that boots right after battery state. Either way, they are uninstallable, and I've not only tried the repo drivers but also manually DL'ing and installing (ikno, another super bad practice) archive drivers from Nvidia. None have worked :\

I have also, in desperation, tried running Minecraft under WINE, but Java does not like installing in WINE and it doesn't come with java. So no go. 

So I'm searching for any ideas here on how to improve performance. Any help will be appreciated. Thanks :D

EDIT: Just had an idea...my system has Nvidia's Optimus graphics platform that switches between dedicated and integrated. Right now, theres no way (that I've found) of switching in Linux. I just assumed that it would default to the dedicated, and my assumption was backed when it prompted me to install Nvidia drivers, but I'm second guessing myself now. Is it possible that I'm actually running on integrated graphics and I don't know it? I can't find any information in my system panel to suggest definitely either way; every single screen lists both the Intel Mobile 4r7 and the NVIDIA GT215/GT335m as VGA devices, but doesn't list which one is...active...I'll try rebooting and setting the BIOS to force dedicated and see if that changes anything, then report back. :D

EDIT2: Ok I'm freaking out now. I think it seriously was running on the intel integrated when the BIOS was set to 'switchable'. Even though it detected both Intel and Nvidia before I rebooted, it now only displays Nvidia on every screen I can find (lspci and HardInfo). GDM is noticably laggier. Minecraft runs worse. I now postulate thus: I was getting errors after installing the Nvidia drivers because it was attempting to output video to a display adapter which wasn't enabled, thus X couldn't start. I am going to try installing the Nvidia drivers now. If I don't make it back in 10 minutes, it's because I've failed. Wish me luck, the one person who has probably read this since I posted it :D

EDIT3: DEAR LORD I'M BACK AND I'M HAPPY! I feel like such an idiot...but Minecraft is running at 250 FPS, the drivers installed nearly without a hitch (I now get some cryptic terminal output every time I boot up before it hits login, but it gets past it, so it's good I guess), and I think the Nvidia X display manager actually fixed another problem I was having with an external monitor.

~~* md1 is /boot, ~64MB, sd[abc]1 raid 1~~
~~* sd[abc]2 is swap~~
~~* md3 is / ~50GB, sd[abc]3 raid 1~~
~~* md4 is an lvm vg with /usr, /var, /opt, /home, etc. sd[abc]4 raid 5~~

~~Ignoring the various issues I originally had getting TuxOnIce working, once working I had issues with it crashing on resume from hibernate. I have 16GB of ram and had only 1GB of swap on each drive because I rarely touch it. Even though I had compression on I figured the X/E17/firefox/etc just couldn't fit in the 3gb.~~

~~So I booted parted magic and stole ~4GB from each sd[abc]3 to give to sd[abc]2. The next hibernation/resume worked fine, as did several subsuqent ones.~~

~~Several days later I figured out that md3 was no longer mounting and it was falling back to using sdc3. I rebooted to parted magic and tried reassembling, recreating, and a few other nondestructive things but fsck complained about the lack of superblock. I used fsck to put the ext3 superblocks back but then mdadm complained about the lack of *md* superblock. I gave up at this point.~~

In all this I realized I had left my external USB hdd off (turned off during partitioning to avoid derps) and turned it on to make a fresh backup. The next hibernate resume crashed. Ultimately I figured out that having the hdd on or having my Android phone plugged into usb will cause it to crash on resume, regardless of what state it was when hibernated. 


The final and most minor problem is that TuxOnIce won't turn the computer off after hibernating. It won't reboot if I hit R when hibernating, either. 


So: 

~~How do I fix md3 (assuming there's something smarter than blanking two of the drives and starting from scratch)?~~ fixed

How do I keep TuxOnIce from crashing (kernel panic?) on resume with USB drives activated? 

How do I make TuxOnIce turn off the computer after hibernating?


All this is on Gentoo with a 3.9 kernel, everything's about a month out of date because I didn't want to upgrade anything that'd touch the few partitions on / and drive md3 more out of sync. 

I should be able to answer any other questions as needed.  ( xposted to the gentoo forums at http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-p-7369542.html#7369542 )

as I'm getting more into linux, I'd like to make a few changes to my setup which seem pretty advanced to me.

But first of all let me explain my setup so you know with what you are dealing with.

This is a Lenovo T430s with a 500GB HDD and an additional 128GB mSATA crucial M4 SSD. I'm currently running Fedora 19 and I chose to encrypt the whole SSD during the inital setup of Fedora.
Fedora used 60GB as luks encrypted /home partition which isn't that much after a while.

If I use a lsblk right now, it looks like this:

    NAME                                          MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE  MOUNTPOINT
    sda                                             8:0    0 465,8G  0 disk  
    └─sda1                                          8:1    0 465,8G  0 part  /mnt/newhome
    sdb                                             8:16   0 119,2G  0 disk  
    ├─sdb1                                          8:17   0   200M  0 part  /boot/efi
    ├─sdb2                                          8:18   0   500M  0 part  /boot
    └─sdb3                                          8:19   0 118,6G  0 part  
      └─luks-32ead9fa-03af-46a6-9503-a9426ab00d86 253:0    0 118,6G  0 crypt 
        ├─fedora-swap                    253:1    0   7,8G  0 lvm   [SWAP]
        ├─fedora-root                    253:2    0    50G  0 lvm   /
        └─fedora-home                    253:3    0  60,8G  0 lvm   /home
    sr0     

So I'd like to move the /home partition from /dev/sdb3 to /dev/sda1. That is pretty easy. The rather hard part is that I'd also like to encrypt the HDD as well so that it is getting decrypted together with my SSD during the boot process and correctly mounted as my new /home (I'm guessing fstab is my friend in here).
In Addition to that, I'd like to enlarge the root luks encrypted partition by the now freed up 60 GB of my old /home folder as I don't need that anymore.

My questions for you are if this is possible at all, and if it is, how would be the best way to approach this?

Many Thanks in advance!

I am running standard Ubuntu 12.10.

Things that make this hard:

* I have root access.
* The computer might shut down and start up during the period.
* There needs to be no way for me to recover the string before the period ends.
* I'll have no internet access for the duration of the period.

Some possible avenues of attack:

* Run a program that generates the string and stores it in memory, waits for n seconds, then prints the string. This won't work because the process would be killed if the computer restarted, and I might look in the program's memory to find the string.
* Let the program change the root password to the randomly-generated string, removing root access from me; let it store the string in a file that only root has r/w access to, and let root repeatedly run a program which checks whether the period is over, and if so, give me the string (and thus root access). This sounds like it would work, but removing root access would be inconvenient and I'd have to reinstall Ubuntu every time something went wrong.

The reason I need to do this is that I have an addiction to internet porn. Most of the time I can control it, but I get cravings late at night. This is even harder because I use a computer for my work and I work from home. So lately I've started removing /sbin/dhclient, which disables internet connectivity (until I can get a liveCD and copy the file back, but that takes a while). What I want to do instead is to generate a password for dhclient (by encrypting dhclient, or just creating a zipfile with that password), and then only have the password given back to me the next morning. Basically I'm trying to find a [commitment device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commitment_Device), a bit like an alcoholic pouring his liquor into the sink.

I'm running 4 monitors on 2 ATI Radeon HD7850s (2 monitors per card), on Mint 15 x64 with the Mate desktop. Right now I'm using the ATI downloadable driver and Xinerama to make the dual GPUs workable with one desktop, but as I'm sure we're all aware, Xinerama disables hardware acceleration and as a result my display is choppy as hell.  It's far from optimal, but it works, so I can roll with it for now.  But I really would like nothing more than to disable Xinerama and get my hardware acceleration back.

I've heard that Xrandr 1.4 allegedly has support for multiple GPUs, but I can't find anyone who's managed to pull it off.  Nor can I find any documentation for Xrandr 1.4 that gets me enough knowledge to be confident that I can mess with it and live to tell the tale.  ""xrandr --listproviders"" shows me both of my cards, but I can't figure out what the other outputs are called to configure them (the two on card 1 are ""HDMI-0"" and ""DVI-0"" so you'd think since I've got the same connections on the other card it would be HDMI-1 and DVI-1 but that doesn't seem to be the case).

So, my question is, can it be done, or is the hype all BS?  Even if it's not possible, I'd love for someone to provide me (or link me to) a detailed, noob-friendly tutorial on Xrandr, since I've only got the simplest idea of how it works.  I really want to turn off Xinerama and get the full speed out of my cards, this choppiness sucks and I find it incredibly hard to believe that in all the years that multi-GPU setups and Linux have existed, nobody has come up with a way to make them work properly.  I know I'm not the only person with this problem or the only person who would benefit greatly from a known solution... Anyone out there have ideas or experience that can help?

The problem is when it is trying to boot up it does not seem to recognize my HDD as a place to boot from, it simply gives me an error stating that there are not valid boot devices. If I place a live USB in there though, it will boot fine off of that. Or if I go into the boot menu, it does not display the HDD as an option to boot from.

If it matters, I have reinstalled it twice now, and the Ubuntu installer did recognize that Ubuntu had been installed.

I'm giving opensuse a try and I like it so far (apart from package management having a lot of packages listed 4 times and not always ""human readable"" names). However, with the ati driver installed I have an issue with gnome windows (I'm running KDE). When tool tips appear or menues (anything that's an overlay I suppose) there is all kinds of colorful art if acting around them. This doesn't happen with qt apps, but I use chrome as my browser so its a pretty big issue. 

The second question, which is really more of a discussion than anything, is what is the best district for me?  I've tried fedora, Ubuntu, opensuse, arch and chakra. Ubuntu almost never has the newest packages, fedora doesn't have some packages even with rpm fusion, opensuse has package name problems and the above video issues, chakra has no gnome apps and the installer is poop, arch is a bitch to get running properly on apple hardware (my fault, I know, but as soon as X is involved I just want to throw things). So yeah, now what?   I need a distro that has every package under the sun I could possibly ever need without needing to install from source or hunt down dependencies, has the newest stable version of packages, and is compatible with ati drivers.

1371483946.0,8,self.linuxquestions,1girdq,Can't boot off second hard drive - grub never runs,NorthStarZero,8,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1girdq/cant_boot_off_second_hard_drive_grub_never_runs/,"I'll do what I can to make this short:

When machine was built, had 2 x 1Tb hard drives formatted as /boot (100 Mb) /, (200 Gb), swap (4 Gb) and /home (the rest) The /home partition was set up as an md RAID 1 array
 
sda: /boot, /, swap, /home array

sdb: /boot2, /sysback, swap, /home array

The intent was to mount / as an md array as well, but it appears I never got around to it.

Recently, I picked up a new pair of 3Tb drives, and installed them as a single disk md RAID 1 array. Then I revisited sda and sdb, with the goal of making the /boot partition a little bigger (kernel updates fill it up a lot) nudging swap a little bigger, adding a little more space to the root filesystem, and assigning the rest of the space to a mount point on /home

So I ran gparted and re-partitioned sdb as follows:

/boot2 (1 Gb)

/root2 (300 Gb)

swap (8 Gb)

/home/backups (the rest)

/root2 and /home/backups were added to new md RAID arrays (2 members but one missing) and the contents of / was copied onto the new RAID array.

NOTE - PAINFUL LESSON LEARNED - Rebooting with ""degraded"" RAID arrays will silently stop Ubuntu 12.04 from booting! You must add the kernel option ""bootdegraded=true"" to menu.1st or the damn thing hangs!

With that done, gparted was used to edit sda to match sdb, with one exception - the /boot partition was left untouched. So sda looks like:

/boot (100Mb)

empty space (no partition allocated)

/root (300 Gb - part of a RAID array)

swap (8 Gb)

/home/backups (the rest - part of a RAID array)

With the new RAID partitions added to their respective arrays and synched up, the system now looks like this:

/boot   (sda1 - 100 Mb)

/boot2 (sdb1 - 1 Gb)

/ (/dev/md0, 300 Gb, composed of sba2 and sdb2)

/home (/dev/md2, 3Tb, composed of sdc and sdd)

/home/backups (/dev/md3, ~600 Gb, composed of sda4 and sdb4)

Awesome possum. Machine boots and runs just fine.

The missing step was to expand /boot up to a full 1Gb, but I didn't want to muck with /boot until I had a backup. So the contents of /boot were copied onto /boot2, and grub--install run pointed at /dev/sdb (plus /boot2's menu.1st edited to point at the right spots)

But when I try to boot the system from /boot2, it hangs, never getting as far as starting grub to try and boot the kernel.

What am I missing?

As for DVDs, I'm not entirely convinced I need to change the format right now.  If I have the space, I'd be happy to simply copy the MPEG2 to my drive.  If I need to, I can always reencode later, but I'd like to keep all the special features, captions and commentary tracks.  Is there any utility, script or process that can copy 4 simultaneous DVDs, stripped of CSS, to the drive for use in a media library?

In the lvm, it only created two partitions, root and swap. I wanted a third home partition so when I had the time I decided to fix that.

I use a Fujitsu Lifebook UH75/J, and right now I have split its 500GB HDD into two relatively unequal partitions (where my Linux distro gets more leeway than the Win8 partition that came with the computer). However, like most Ultrabooks nowadays, my HDD comes with a 24GB SSD (treated as a separate drive by both the BIOS and Linux, invisible in Windows),  which Windows apparently uses for caching when it boots either coldly or from hibernation.

I don't really care if Windows boots slowly anyway since I almost exclusively boot there to play games (plus I believe that it's the equivalent of making a slow minivan run faster by attaching jet engines on it). I want to install my Linux distro on the SSD, so that I can finally experience booting in seconds.

My problem is, I'm not entirely comfortable with the size of the SSD, so I don't think I'll be able to put my /home partition there alongside with the root partition. Also, I've decided to separate the /var partition from the /root partition as well to prevent temporary files and logs from filling up and potentially damaging the SSD.

So my question is this: If I put my root partition on the SSD and put my /home partition on the mechanical HDD, will it affect boot performance. If so, how much?

Right now I have the following options for the partitioning scheme:

1. Both / and /home in SSD. / is given around 16GB, the rest goes to /home. Personal media files are put in an NTFS partition in the HDD. 
2. Only / in SSD. /home, as well as personal media files are put on the HDD.

Also, the distro I'm thinking of installing is the XFCE spin of Fedora. My current distro is Kubuntu 13.04, but seeing the direction where Ubuntu is going I'm worried that non-Unity variants like Kubuntu will not last very long. Are there any tweaking I have to do in order to optimize Fedora running on the SSD?

#**Backup**

I should probably do some kind of backup in case of disk malfunction.

* **RAID 1** This is probably not the way to go as this is geared more towards ~~better access~~ preventing downtime than as backup? Plus it might be difficult to setup with external harddrives.

* **Do some kind of incremental backup of one drive on the other** What's the best way to do this? Should the backup drive be bigger than the other drive?

What measures are recommended to detect and notify me of disk malfunction?

#**Web server**

Which of these would you recommend?

* **nginx** I've been seeing nginx mentioned a lot lately, I'm sure there is a reason. From what I've gathered it's lightweight and stable which might be good for my setup.
* **Apache** I have previous experience with apache, which might make it easier to set up. **Edit:** This also seems to be the setup that's most tested with owncloud.

#**Database**

Should I choose mariadb or mysql? Does it depend on my choice of distro?

#**Partitioning and formatting**
Should I use LVM in case i decide to purchase additional disks? What kind of filesystem is recommended?

#**Misc**

My mother in law recently connected to my FTP server to download some files.

I was wondering if that connection history is stored in the /var/log/wtmp file (I found it mentioned in the [manpages](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/dapper/man8/in.ftpd.8.html)), and if it is in there how can I find it?

    sudo grep '[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}\.[0-9]\{1,3\}' /var/log/wtmp

*I am somewhat confused how Fedora handles libraries - like what are the default locations, enviroment variables that that store additional locations et cetera. Does anyone know whats what?*

**Background:**
I am using Fedora 18 x64_86 and I have just installed Gurobi optimizer with R interface. Installation was mostly manual, as the developer distributes zipped binaries and user extracts software to a chosen location, exports $GUROBI_HOME to $PATH and $GUROBI_HOME/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. As result, gurobi should be callable from the shell and its shared libraries should be easily discovered by other software.

I intend to us Gurobi (x86_64) in conjuction with R (x86_64), which is facilitated by R module packaged along with Gurobi. Installation went without a hitch, but when I tried to call gurobi from R, this happened:

&gt; library(gurobi)

&gt;Loading required package: slam

&gt;Error in dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...) : 

&gt;unable to load shared object '/home/lukas/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/2.15/gurobi/libs/gurobi.so':
&gt; libgurobi55.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

&gt;Error: package/namespace load failed for ‘gurobi’

So in short, I dont really get what is happening. Quick overview:

'/home/lukas/R/x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu-library/2.15/gurobi/libs/gurobi.so' - locatB of only library bundled with R module

'/opt/gurobi550/linux64/lib/' - libraries shipped with gurobi, containing libgurobi.so.5.5.0, symlinked as libgurobi55.so in the same directory. Location is referenced in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

When I have symlinked libgurobi.so.5.5.0 from its original location to /lib/lib64/libgurobi55.so, everything started working perfectly.

I recently reorganized my music files on my music server to make rsyncing them from my laptop easier.  I had my music in /home/8spd/Music with a link to my girlfriend's music in her user folder and it was working great.  I changed the mpd config file music_directory to /home/8spd/mpd_music with a bunch of links in that folder to the various locations (/home/8spd/BackUps/foo/bar/Music, /home/gf/Music, etc) and the music in folders represented by some of the links is showing up, but not others.  Namely *my music* is not showing up.

I feel like it's likely because I don't know the Linux, and didn't use the ln command properly, but I think I did it the same way for the links who's music is loading, as well as those who's music is not.  I'm pretty sure I made the all links like this:
    ln --symbolic /home/8spd/BackUps/foo/bar/Music ""8spd's music""

Also permissions, or ownership does not seem to be a problem.

**Edit:** I got it working.  Apparently I don't understand how permissions work, and/or how links work.  I had the permissions of one of the folders in the target path of the link set to not allow reading by users other than myself, but the folder containing the music was readable by all users.  I guess symbolic links need to have all the folders in the path readable by user following the link?  Or something?  Weird though, I sudo'd in as mpd and could follow the link just fine.

----------------------------------------------------

So heres currently what happened. I did the command

    sudo pacman -Syu

then i rebooted

Upon rebooting i found that my touchpad on mylaptop no longer works. I found some help on the irc and they told me to check for any pacnew's usin the command

    ls -la /etc/*.pacnew

i used vimdiff to fix up everything and make sure they matched. typed 

    pacman -Syu

no more updates, i rebooted and it still didnt work. I tried again thist time i installed 

    pacman -S xf86-input-mouse

still nothing. Oh i should mention that i plugged in a normal usb mouse and it works, only the touchpad does not work.

Any help you guys can throw my way is greatly appreciated. 

Thank you.

I used the compressed air to clear out my graphics card then put it back in. When I booted, right away I noticed the grub menu looked strange because the font looked 4x larger. (This happens when I have my dvi cable plugged into the wrong dvi port, but it doesn't matter any more.)

When I tried to boot Ubuntu I would get a purple screen for a long time followed by a black screen... then nothing. After googling around on another computer I found that adding the ""nomodeset"" parameter to the grub boot options got me through to the log in. The login screen as row of blinking white pixels across the top, but otherwise seems okay. But when I log in, it looks like the rows of pixels are at crazy offsets or something.

I figured I had damaged my graphics card, except I am able to boot into Windows fine and run video games and graphics card tests. An interesting thing to note is the nvidia driver crashed when I started Windows the first time after cleaning, but was fine after that. This is very strange to me, because the bugs seemed like a hardware error. I tried removing the graphics card and placing it back in, but that doesn't seem to help at all.

So far I have tried:

* Taking gfx card out then back in
* Updating UEFI
* Resetting CMOS
* Booting from thumb drive Ubuntu (same issue)
* Changing PCI slot of gfx card
* Cleaning gfx card connectors with alcohol and swab.
* Using a another graphics card


I am using a Asrock Z77 Extreme4 motherboard with a Nvidia 670 gtx graphics card. Any help is welcome.

I tried to boot into a Fedora live USB, but get a blank screen, which is what I get on Ubuntu unless I boot with nomodeset.

When I got home that evening Chromium would not stay open so I decided to reboot. Unbeknownst to me having a full hard-drive and third-party drivers is a no-go, ending up with an error message on the screen, but no mouse or keyboard interactions (ctrl+alt+f2 still worked, though).

It wasn't until I tried to use the tab-auto-complete of the terminal and received an error that I realized what it was. 

Thankfully I had about 60 gig of useless files. I deleted them and thought that my issue was over. The next day (yesterday), my hard-drive was full again. Since I needed the machine running, but i had to go to work, I deleted my tf2 maps and related files.(about 20GB) That didn't even last overnight. This morning I received the exact same error. I used the disk usage analyzer several times, but for some reason it was not able to scan ~/.xsession-errors.old, and showed that my home folder was 400GB in size, while the largest folder or file was 5GB.

The laptop was getting old and running very, very slow before I installed Ubuntu, it would take forever to start up, opening up Safari would almost always lock up the thing, and Chrome wasn't much better. When new, this was a fairly spunky laptop, so I assumed completely formatting the HDD and installing Linux would bring it back up a little closer to snuff.

Apparently I was incorrect! It struggles to even open Chrome or Firefox, and basically the second I start to do anything (like skype video chat or play a youtube vid) it gets so kerfuffled it heats up and the cooling fans slowly ramp up to what sounds like full blast in less than a minute.

I think it may have to do with the graphics but I'm not sure... Under system details the graphics are listed as 'unknown', as is the graphics driver.

When I start the computer up it always comes up with a system error about the graphics. It says a System program problem was detected and asks if i want to report it. I accept reporting it and then it pops up saying it has an internal error, and then another pops up saying it detected a GPU hang, is that correct? I report the hang, and then it just keeps happening until i hit cancel and don't report the system problem in the first place.

Any ideas?

I downloaded the latest NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-310.32.run from nvidia's web site.  Then I did the following from a text console as root:

    stop lightdm
    bash ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-310.32.run

The installation stops, telling me that a pre-install script failed.  I traced this to the file /usr/lib/nvidia/pre-install, which contains the following:

    #!/bin/sh
    
    # Trigger an error exit status to prevent the installer from overwriting
    # Ubuntu's nvidia packages.
    
    exit 1

Next I un-installed all of Ubuntu's nvidia-* packages except nvidia-common, as ubuntu-desktop claimed it as a dependency.  Then I tried re-running the installer.  Same error as before.  Throw caution to the wind and plod ahead anyway and X still doesn't work.

Backed out by uninstalling nvidia's 310.32 drivers and forced a re-install of Ubuntu's nvidia drivers.  Now things are back to normal.

I took a look at the ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates ppa, but it looks like the latest nvidia driver on there is 304.

Fast forward to now and I would really like to install inkscape to build a brochure for my business.

I can open the manager, find inkscape, click on install, asks for admin password, enter password, thinks for a second, returns to standard inkscape software screen with the 'not installed' button as it was.

I then tested this again by installing a vaguely useful internet radio software package and the same thing happened. I've also had a few problems with authentication on the update manager too. This is my work laptop so it's browser history is squeaky clean and no torrent software or anything like that.

I am not adverse to reinstalling the whole OS to the latest version of Mint but would prefer not too as I am far from a power user and I've got everything the way I like it.

I saw the post on /r/linux a couple days ago of some guy ranting how his new laptop wasn't capable of running linux because of EFI, and how a lot of people started posting guides and helped him set everything up. Now I got a brand new Sony laptop with EFI hardware, and I'm trying to set up a Windows + Ubuntu 12.10 dual boot, which should be compatible with EFI, but I can't get it to recognize the GRUB bootloader. I've posted this on a Ubuntu forum, but they keep linking me the same guides that I already tried and that didn't help, so I'm hoping one of you knows what my problem is and can help me fix it.

I have installed Ubuntu on my hard drive, booting the CD via my EFI menu, and Ubuntu has added a folder to my EFI system partition, so I'm assuming I did everything correct on this part. Using the CD's GRUB I can manually boot Ubuntu on my HDD and it works fine, so Ubuntu was installed correctly. But booting without CD always defaults to Windows bootloader, giving me no option to start Ubuntu.

I've tried reinstalling everything, updating GRUB, reinstalling GRUB (because that's what people recommended) but nothing changed, and now I'm running out of ideas. 

There are two things on my system that are a little odd, and I think they might be part of the problem. First up, my HDD has two EFI system partitions:

    root@ubuntu:~# parted -l
    Model: ATA WDC WD5000BPVT-5 (scsi)
    Disk /dev/sda: 500GB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/4096B
    Partition Table: gpt
    
    Number  Start   End     Size    File system     Name                          Flags
     1      1049kB  274MB   273MB   fat32           EFI system partition          hidden
     2      274MB   1819MB  1546MB  ntfs            Basic data partition          hidden, diag
     3      1819MB  2092MB  273MB   fat32           EFI system partition          boot
     4      2092MB  2226MB  134MB                   Microsoft reserved partition  msftres
     5      2226MB  319GB   317GB   ntfs            Basic data partition
     7      319GB   321GB   2047MB  ext4
     9      321GB   465GB   144GB   ext4
     8      465GB   469GB   4169MB  linux-swap(v1)
     6      469GB   500GB   31.0GB  ntfs            Basic data partition          hidden, diag

Partition 3 has the boot flag, and Ubuntu added the folder for the grubx64.efi to this partition, so I'm guessing this is the one used during the boot process. Except for the Ubuntu folder partitions 1 and 3 seem to be identical.

The other thing is, when booting from CD the system seems to be using a different boot configuration. If I run efibootmgr after booting from CD, this is what I get:

    root@ubuntu:~# efibootmgr
    BootCurrent: 0000
    Timeout: 0 seconds
    BootOrder: 2001
    Boot0000* EFI DVD/CDROM (MATSHITADVD-RAM UJ8A7AS)
    Boot0001* EFI DVD/CDROM (MATSHITADVD-RAM UJ8A7AS)
    Boot0002* EFI DVD/CDROM (MATSHITADVD-RAM UJ8A7AS)

Is it possible that I can't change the HDD boot configuration when booting from CD, and therefor can't add an entry for GRUB to the EFI menu? From what I understand I should be seeing both CD and HDD boot options, but the CD is all I get.

I'm in #r/linux on freenode right now, so if one of you wants to help via IRC that would be great, but any advice is welcome in this thread. If you need any additional information just ask. I'll have to leave in about 2 hours from now, but I will be back later today to read your posts.

I have a computer with three hard drives. One of them is a large 2TB NTFS formatted disc, and the other two are 120GB SSD's with Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04 on them respectively. 

I installed Ubuntu on this computer initiailly, and formatted the second 120GB SSD with ext4 and mounted it at /usr/share/secondhd.

Afterwards, I used the Ubuntu live CD and repartitioned that hard drive with NTFS - which I then restarted my PC and using the Windows 7 DVD I installed Windows 7 on that disc.

(Just an aside, at this point my boot loader wasn't picking up so I had to repair it using the live USB)

I use grub to boot into Windows 7 if need be, but most of the time I'm working in Ubuntu.

Whenever I boot into Ubuntu, it always hangs at attempting to mount /usr/share/secondhd. It's an annoyance, since every time I boot it must be interactive so I can press S (for skip) so Ubuntu can finish booting up.

I want to edit the configuration file which tells Ubuntu to attempt to mount this partition, which doesn't exist any more (since it's been repurposed for Windows 7). Any ideas/tips on where to go?

My question involves the storage array options available to me. My ideal setup would be to purchase 2x 2TB drives and RAID5 those together with a 1TB drive that I have lieing around. Obviously this will give me 2TB of usable space. A lot of wasted space, but good potential future upgradability.

In the future, I would want to buy another 2TB drive and replace the 1TB drive, expanding to 4TB. How hard would this be to accomplish? It'd be two ""actions"" on the array I'd think; rebuilding the array after a drive loss, then expanding the array to make use of the additional space. Is there just a simple series of commands which could do this?

And in the even further future, expanding beyond 3 drives. If I added a 4th 2TB drive, could the array expand itself easily onto that?

Second: The screen resolution doesn't fit my screen. The top, bottom, and side bars are all off screen and the only 2 choices for the screen resolution won't work. The resolution I'm using with windows is 1280x768 and I'm using a Philips monitor with HDMI.

I haven't installed it yet, I'm just running it from the CD and I don't want to wipe my current working windows 8 OS for an OS I can't figure out. I wouldn't mind dual booting until I have learned Ubuntu well enough to completely switch over but I don't know how and I'm afraid I will regret playing with it until something happens. 

I tried looking for some tutorials and other help from forums online but I couldn't find anything helpful. Please help! Ubuntu looks so amazing and I tried mint, zorin, fedora, and a chrome variant and Ubuntu is my favorite as far as booting from the disk and YouTube videos go. Also, all of those had the same 2 issues. 

Edit: I'm a noob not a noon. I'm also an idiot which is why that's there. Plus I added a couple details that might help.

Edit 2: I've decided to run it in virtual box until I get the hang of it and find the fixes. I think the reason some of the suggestions aren't working are because I'm on Windows 8 Consumer Preview and because I'm trying to run it from a Live CD. 

Edit 3: UPDATE!! I downloaded the LTS version and installed it using WIBU and it worked! I'm able to dual boot! To fix the screen resolution I had to use a VGA cable instead of HDMI and the drivers for my graffics card are downloading now so hopefully I will be able to use HDMI again.

I use my Windows computer for normal computing and I use my Linux computer mainly as a file server.  In addition to mounting Linux shared directories to my Windows machine, I like to backup a couple folders to my Linux machine from my Windows machine.  So far I have it set up like this:

I have a shared folder on my Windows machine.  I have a simple three line bash script that mounts the share, runs rsync, and dismounts the share.  This happens every morning at 5am.  The rsync command has the **--delete** argument, so that the Linux backup properly reflects the Windows share.

**Here's the problem:**  Sometimes the Windows share is unavailable because it is off or I forgot to decrypt the drive that the share is on.  Since the rsync command has the **--delete** argument, it ends up deleting all the files.  It then has to re-transfer all the files again once the script runs again and the Windows share is actually available.

**What I would like to do:**  Instead of just *being more careful* and making sure the share is available, I would like to add something to the script that first checks this first before deleting all my files.  What would y'all recommend I use to complete this task?  Perl, Python, or does bash have some way of doing this?  I am not afraid of learning a little Python to do this.
