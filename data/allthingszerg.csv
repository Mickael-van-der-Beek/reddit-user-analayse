I see this kind've hyper aggression over and over and over again. This zerg flew into my base, absolutely ravaged it, and...stayed on lair tech trying to kill me.

This used to work. This is what you're all used to. Terran's pushed back into his base getting owned and then we GG.

BUT this is HotS now, and terran has a ""prayer"" unit now. The widow mine, a unit that has and will continue to get hate for baling terran out've tough spots. The more widow mines you let us get out, the easier these parade attacks are to hold. SO if you continue to throw units at us at the same numbers and the same upgrades and the same composition and we keep getting out mines, each attack will be easier and easier to hold until your units lost totals much higher than ours.

You don't get to just kill terran's outright anymore. What you can still do is get a bunch of damage done and then tech up. I've played multiple games like the one you see here where I FINALLY get to leave my base and I don't see ultra infestor ling bling muta. WHY didn't this guy I'm playing ever get upgrades/ultras.

Listen guys, we thrive on beating lair tech, it brings us more joy than anything in the game. If you throw mutas at us, like 15, force some turrets and make us panic to make marines then have ultras out when we push out on the map you just win.

We aren't an easy matchup anymore where you just fungal us and it's game over. You have to tech to broodlords or ultras and you probably want infestors too. I know it's not THAT easy, but watch the game I played against this guy and tell me he didn't have the resources to take all the expos and get ultras. Instead he made flimsy mutas, seperated them from his main army lost the game. This is not a one time thing, literally every matchup I play is won or lost on the ability of the zerg to recognize when he's done enough damage to fall back and tech or if he thinks he can just kill me and lets me claw back into the game.

GET TO HIVE AND BEAT ME IN THIS GAME PLEASE!!! Every fast hive game I play is like an insta win for zerg. Every game where they try to overwhelm me with muta/ling/bling I play my heart out to win and then they come here and QQ about how mines are sooooo good. Well of course they are against lair tech, that's why they exist.

GET. ULTRAS. PLEASE. I want to feel good if I beat you, not feeling bad about how I made somebody rage, this matchup used to be civilized!

1347526218.0,62,self.allthingszerg,ztbjn,Should you always go 10pool ZvZ on the ladder?,Drabzalver,84,22,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/ztbjn/should_you_always_go_10pool_zvz_on_the_ladder/,"Firstly, for sake of this discussion, I'm going to establish some nomenclature, this is just for easy reference, I don't mean to say these definitions are objective but it helps keeping shorter names.

- cheese: Any pool lower than 10
- Pool first: 14/15 pool or 14 gas 14 pool or 15 pool 16 gas, anything in that vicinity
- hatch first: 14/15/16 hatch
- 10pool, well, just 10pool obviously
- overpool, either an overpool at 10 drones, or an overpool at 11 drones using the extractor trick

That said, the build order advantage diagramme of ZvZ sort of looks like this:

- hatch first &gt; pool first (edit: This is apparently very much debatable, see: [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/x5yxl/zergs_most_economical_opening/))

---

- pool first &gt; 10pool
- pool first &gt; overpool
- pool first &lt;-&gt; cheese (debatable, what I'm basically saying is that you can still lose to cheese if you don't scout well with a pool first on most maps but it should be easy to hold if you see it coming)

---

- overpool &gt; hatch first
- overpool &gt; cheese
- overpool &gt; 10pool

---

- 10pool &gt; hatch first
- 10pool &gt; cheese
- 10pool drone all in &gt;&gt; hatch first

---

- cheese &gt;&gt; hatch first
- cheese &lt;-&gt; pool first

I'm using '&gt;' to indicate a build order advantage '&lt;-&gt;' to indicate both are roughtly on similar footing and it's going to come down to control and micro and '&gt;&gt;' to indicate a winning advantage, that is to say, you have to screw up to still lose and if both players play of same skill, you should always be able to win and end the game there.

First thing that becomes apparent, despite the vast popularity of hatch first, it only nets you an advantage against one build, the pool first, against cheese you auto lose, against overpools and 10pools you may not immediately die, but you will lose so much mining time and drones that in practice, the attacking player will come out ahead with a worker lead.

The obvious hing I want to look at is the 10pool, it loses to two things, overpool and pool first, however, against overpool the disadvantage is of course extremely small, in my experience, against pool first the advantage is no more than pool first against hatch first and at the pro level you often see 10pooling players exit the initial skermish against pool first with a drone lead, which I think is very much attainable if your zergling control is superior to his drone micro. I indeed often ascertain a drone lead from 10pools versus pool first.

However, if you send a drone scout with it and verify a hatch first, or on some maps do that with overlord scouts which is possible on Shakuras or Condemned in time, you can send all but 3 of your drones with it, build 2 spines at his shit, I do not believe it is ever possible to hold that without the 10pooling player screwing up in some way. If you believe otherwise please, give a replay, but I have never seen it at the pro level or on the ladder and IdrA agrees with this assesment (yeah, I know, argument to authority sucks, but I take his authority over people here unless a replay that disputes this can be post).

So basically, the 10pool brings you in an interesting situation, it nets you an advantage against everything but overpool and pool first, the disadvantage against overpool is quite small. It cannot be automatically beaten by anything, and with proper scouting it automatically defeats hatch first. Hatch first only nets you an advantage against one build and can be automatically defeated by many. In that sense, 10pool is not taking a risk at all, it is one of the safest openers whereas hatch first is taking a major risk. Pool first might be the safest opener, but isn't capable of directly killing anything although it could be argued that if you hold of cheese with this you're basically in a winning advantage whereas you aren't per se with 10pool, but holding cheese without any losses with a 10pool is very easy.

So that's why I feel that statistically in ZvZ on the ladder, you should _always_ 10pool, it has a certain 'cheesy' or 'coinflippy' aura to it because it's an earlish pool, but in reality it is the safest and dare I say least coin flippy way to play ZvZ.

Leenock vs Naniwa Game 1:

15hatch

16pool

16gas

@100 gas, lingspeed

3rd queen immediately at natural

6:00 double evo

1/1 ups when evos done (~7:00)

7:30 3rd base, lair, 2nd gas, 4th queen

8:30 3rd &amp; 4th gas

9:00 macro hatch, infestation pit

9:40 2/2 upgrades

10:00 hive

10:20 triple infestor, no pathogen glands

11:00 5th + 6th gas

12:30 3/3, adrenal glands, ultra cavern

13:00 4th base

13:40 chitenous plating

~15:00 Ultralisk push hits protoss

Notes:

- Leenock did 15hatch blindly as a slight metagame to the gateway openers Naniwa was doing all tournament long. Usually you should 15pool instead to be safe vs some early rushes.

- Use zerglings to defend all early pushes

- Seems weak vs sentry immortal 2base allin, as well as some other early pushes. Unsure of it, haven't tested.

- Dont wait for max with ultras, you dont want protoss to be close to max as well, better in lower unit counts

- Bring queens with ultra army when pushing near max for transfuses. Creep spread helps!

- Bring 2-3 infestors purely for the snare effect of fungals

- Don't rely on infestors to defend anything, they need to pool up energy over time

- No need for pathogen glands, you dont need the energy early and you aren't going to be making enough infestors for it.

- Use lings as a mineral dump for constant scouting and counter attacks. They become less useful as the game draws on, so try to be active with them early. They should be surprisingly good with the double ups.

- If you go pool first instead and grab the gas at 20, you can grab a 2nd gas at 6:00. That will make up the extra gas you'll need for the upgrades, then you can simply leave the drones on the gas and you'll be back into the same position you'd be with a 15h16g16p gas-wise.


Weaknesses:

- There are timings protoss can hit before ultras spawn to snipe bases and weaken the zerg lategame

- Not entirely clear if all early gateway timings can be held with lings only

- If protoss turtles until max, they should autowin vs the ultras

- Not the easiest micro when you have to fungal and transfuse at same time

- Queens off creep can be picked off easily if out of position

- Not many fungals banked up for the push. If you miss your fungals, you're not going to have a good time. 


Strengths:

- The ultras hit at a really strong timing around 14-15 mins where the protoss wont have a maxed army.

- Transfuses heal a rediculous amount on low hp ultras",,False,,t5_2tkq6,1367203177.0,,,True,t3_1d9f6s,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1d9f6s/heres_the_zvp_ultralisk_build/,

I am not quite sure if anyone would still be interested in something like that, but I saw a lot of new players in /r/starcraft asking for advice on how to start. I am not even sure if something like that already exists for HotS, but I thought of playing a bronze account into masters as zerg and providing a little bit of insight and the basics that can get you easily into platinum atleast.

1368574314.0,54,self.allthingszerg,1ecji1,The reactive mentality,iWearNoHat,60,6,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1ecji1/the_reactive_mentality/,"Hello good users of /r/AllThingsZerg!

**Introduction**  
~~~~~~~~~~~  
My name is Aaron, I have too many accounts with different names to have a true alias, so I'll just use my first name.

I'm a Master League player that wants to teach you a bit about the reactive mentality of playing Zerg. I've found that once you have a grasp on the right ideas to playing a reactive style, learning from your mistakes, and improving in general becomes much easier.

**Playing reactively does NOT limit your options**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

The first thing that I want to comment about is the pre-conceived notion that playing reactively means that you must play defensively. This is not true whatsoever. I prefer a ling aggression heavy style myself. Many people feel that when you're told to play reactively, that you must scout and prepare for pushes. This is simply not true. One example would be playing reactively versus hellions. If you know there are hellions on the map, you can react by keeping your opponent on his toes. How would you do this? Simple. If your opponent is on their way to your base with his hellions, that means that they'll have less units defending their base, and you can reactively harass your opponent!

**How do I react?**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Second, when I coach/help people/just generally give advice, people ask me, ""Aaron, how do I know how to react?"". You NEED TO SCOUT. SCOUTING TELLS YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO REACT TO. To keep it simple, you learn proper reactions by trying things and just learning from experience, but as a very basic way of thinking, keep the following fact in your mind while you play. In SC2, there are 3 things that your opponent can be spending their money on. That's army, tech, and economy. It's only safe to be doing 2 at a time, all-ins usually do all 3 at a time, then focus purely on army. With that knowledge, when you scout your opponent, you can learn a lot with seemingly very little information. Just do your best to figure out what your opponent is spending money on. For example, if you see early gases and barracks, then they're spending money on tech and army. If you see a Protoss going for a forge fast expand, then they're going for economy and tech. Once you've figured out what your opponent is spending their money on, you should match exactly what they're spending their money on. The way that Zerg macro works, you can almost always do it better. If they are focusing on their economy and their tech, well, you can make more workers than they can! Once you see they are really kicking up their army production, you can make way more units than they can. Alternatively, you can spend your money on the thing they aren't, and I usually pair it with economy. If you see that your opponent is playing greedy, focusing on workers and upgrades, if you mass units on a really strong economy, you can just overwhelm them. This is how the Stephano roach max works, and tons of people know that strategy.

**How do I use this logic to improve?**  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  

Well, if you lose to something, then the loss can usually be attributed to either the wrong reaction, or poor control during the engagement. If you know that your engagement went alright, then it must be that you had the wrong reaction. If you get  hit with an all in and you aren't prepared, then you didn't scout. If you scout an all in coming, then naturally you can prepare for it properly. For example, if you're playing a ZvZ, and they are doing some kind of mass ling all in, if you scout it, then you can simply also start massing lings.

**TL;DR Army, tech, economy. Pick 2, scout and find out which 2 your opponent is doing. Lose games and learn about how you could have reacted better.**

First of all, I want to stress that Lowko is a great player/personality with a lot of quality SC2 content; but with respect, I strongly disagree with some of the points he made in his video (though I agree with some of them too).  I've always been an advocate of aggressive Zerg styles, not only because they're the most fun, but also because an active style (rather than a passive style) is ideal for improving multitasking and mechanics - especially at the beginners' level.


Now I should mention my own bias: I first learned SC2 by repeating the 10-pool in team games, an ""all-in"" style where you keep only 10 workers mining minerals for a very long time. I made it to top 10 global in 2v2s, 3v3s, and 4v4s using the same build, with different variations and transitions of course.  I can say that without a doubt, this was the time when I experienced the most rapid improvement in fundamental mechanics - multitasking, injects, hotkeying/control grouping, rallying Zergling micro, etc. 


When I started moving onto 1v1s more competitively, I heard that Zerg had to play macro/reactive so I copied Idra's multi/ling/bane and whatnot, and I hated it.  It wasn't fun for me, and I didn't yet have the mechanics to manage four saturated bases and late-game armies with multiple control groups, and for that reason I wasn't improving.  Either I would die to some early timing attack, or I would reach my ideal 70-80 drone economy without being able to effectively put it to use.  


That was until I saw some unorthodox replays of JulyZerg and Nestea and a few others - that's when I started using 1-base and 2-base all-ins/timing attacks, and I improved dramatically during this period.  I would do the same opening in each matchup (which at the time was 14gas/14pool) with a couple different options afterwards - 1Base baneling bust, 1 base roach/ling, 2 base roach/ling, 2 base baneling, even weird things like spine crawler rushes.  I experimented more and more with these ""all-in"" attacks, and found that many of the builds that I thought were ""all-in"" could be transitioned out of. Even in some games where I did these attacks and did absolutely no damage, I would always, always, always try another step, another timing attack, another ""all-in"".  I didn't know it then, but this was ""mindset"" training - this taught me to keep my cool in situations where I'm way behind (which is essential regardless of the style you play). Example:
http://www.twitch.tv/tangsc/c/2000201


There would also be so many games where I'd open with say a 1-base baneling all-in against Protoss, do some significant/equalizing damage, and move into the mid-game with neither side knowing who was ahead. Some of the games I transitioned and lost, some of them I transitioned and won. And that's why I think that the whole notion of an ""all-in"" is a bit arbitrary in Starcraft2 - all top-level aggressive players have a follow-through for every attack, no matter how much of a commitment the attack is.


I even made it to Grandmaster when it was released without using a single ""standard"" macro build.  Now, don't get me wrong - I didn't just use the same all-in every time.  My style rotated between different all-ins and timing attacks + transitions, but all-ins are definitely an essential learning tool to develop mechanics in quick (and relatively stress-free) games.


When Lowko said that all players need to learn a standard macro style for all match-ups, I cringed because I think that's such a narrow way of looking at things.  The notion that playing standard macro is the fastest way to improve is a complete myth.  In fact, I'm certain that it's counter-productive for newer players to start with 3-4base macro styles.  For example, I think it's very reasonable for a brand-new Bronze player to learn a 1-base all-in as a first step, and branch out into more economical timings that allow for transitions.


TL;DR - To learn SC2 via ""all-ins"", timing attacks, and aggressive transitions - it is not only highly viable, but arguably the best way to improve.

I've been fiddeling around with the roach openers and I've had great success with them most of the time getting some straight up wins but in most cases just gaining a lead enough to win.

Today I tried something different, my roach openers did unusually bad but I decided to stick with it by doing a 2-3 base 1-1 or 2-2 timings with speedlings, speedroaches and speedbanes.

In one of the replays the terran had great defensive walloffs and a shitton of mines, what I did then was forcing him to reposition a bunch of time and then getting a surround allowing my banelings to detonate and take out most of the mines before they detonated.

I'm going to keep doing this but so far it seems really powerful. Like I said this is just diamond (the guy on daybreak is low masters) but let me know what you guys think.

I am a high-masters Zerg player on NA. I only recently began contributing to this subreddit a few weeks ago, but I have really enjoyed my time here. I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself, my stream, and offer help for anyone that needs it.


I am a 23 year old graduate of George Mason University. While I search for a full-time career I have been playing A LOT of SC2. I'm on a team, Under Rated Gaming, and I hope to begin participating in online tournaments and in our team league which begins this week.


I stream my play almost every day (ladder on all servers, team practice, and other SC2). I keep my streams chat open at all time in my second monitor so I can take questions and interact with the viewers. I play music, commentate my play, and take suggestions for builds or pretty much anything straight from the stream chat. I have a typical viewership of 8-10 people but sometimes I rise up to 20 or 30.


Over the next few days I hope to increase those numbers. I will be streaming most of the day and night today, tomorrow, and Wednesday. I would really appreciate it if you all would check me out and PLEASE give me feedback on how I could improve my stream for you all. 

As I said at the beginning of the post, I want to also give back. I am open to suggestions, but my current ideas are increased in depth commentary about scouting and decision making, replay analysis on or off stream, and playing others low level accounts to show what to look for and how to react.


I am launching up my stream for the day right now, so please come by and check it out. If you have any questions/comments you can either talk to me in the twitch chat or post them here in this thread.


EDIT: Just finished streaming for ~5 hours. Have like 20 viewers and a bunch from this thread! Thanks a lot guys! I'll be streaming again tonight so I hpoe to see you all. I am going to leave this thread up because I hope for some feedback. If you want it down please just post and I can delete it. Thanks again.

I want to start coaching again (I've done a couple of lessons here and there, and received positive feedback) to get myself some practice and to ensure that the quality of feedback and advice I am giving is adequate before I begin charging for lessons. I currently work and study part time (work is slowing down atm, and I finish my course at the end of this month), and I'd like to be able to pick up some extra cash doing something I love: Playing Starcraft 2, and helping others learn! 

If you are interested in learning from me, please PM me (and upvote this post as well! I'm trying to get several students!) and I'll send you the details I need from you (ID, Skype, replays etc.). Please don't post any of this info in the thread, as it will get lost! :)

Thanks, I look forward to the messages!

**EDIT:** Thanks for the massive response everyone! I've decided to make my cut-off at around 20 students( despite getting PMs from lots more) in the interest of keeping the lessons I put together of the highest quality possible. I apologize to anyone that might have missed out, but I'm sure that we'll be able to arrange a time in the near future where we can have a session together. 

Thanks again for all the support! I look forward to teaching all my wonderful new students :)

**EDIT2:** Due to the continued stream of players wishing to receive coaching from me, I've created a group on NA called: ""FLuXSC"" . Anyone can join, and I'd appreciate if all my current students and students who'd like to receive coaching could join up there.

This is high masters on the kr servers and does have gm players (I think all of the ones I played were barcodes though lol).  This will also have my TLMC tournament replay pack where I got to the ro8 and features almost exclusively zvp.

I will give a fair warning in the zvt's you will watch that I played in the past 4-5 days, you will see me attempting to execute roach/ling/bane busts sometimes but making some mistakes due to not doing it much.  So if you want to see some hilarious fails you can watch those!  Otherwise most of the zvt's are going to be straight up macro games.

Some things people might be interested in is my zvp.  I play zvp different then other zergs and have been since hots beta.  I use swarmhosts, but differently then other zergs.  By that I mean now swarmhosts are a lot more common except that zerg players are making mass static defense with them and not really attacking with swarmhosts.  You'll see me use swarmhosts a lot more aggressively and not just sit there.

My late game zvp should be of special note to zerg players who struggle versus late game protoss and anyone who thinks late game voidray/templar/colossi/etc is unbeatable should watch some of my late game zvp in these replays.

In the zvz's you will see mainly cheese whether it's from me or my opponent there aren't many straight up macro games.  You will see some zvz's where I go muta into swarmhost as I feel this is going to be super powerful in zvz in the future as I do think going muta into swarmhost is going to be really powerful.

1369125388.0,39,self.allthingszerg,1er5bj,Don't like muta vs muta? Try the upgraded ling style. It works.,Phoenixed,48,9,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1er5bj/dont_like_muta_vs_muta_try_the_upgraded_ling/,"**INTRODUCTION**

You probably have read some threads on TL or saw streamers experiment with it. As a high diamond I tried it myself, got great results and questions from opponents after games. In fact, I’ve been doing this since HotS launched and haven’t lost a single match to mutalisks yet. The only time I've ever built mutas, the opponent went roach hydra... My ZvZ is 75%.

The gist of the strategy: getting fast 1/1 melee upgrades and flooding the opponent with zerglings from 2 bases to get map control and to deny mutalisk player’s 3rd base while saturating yours. This followed by 2/2 and eventually 3/3 army of ultras/hydras/infestors for sealing the deal. Then load a replay and watch units lost tab. You’ll be surprised.

The build assumes other player is going mutalisks. If he’s building roch/hydra instead, it's not an autoloss. The only difference is that you get swarm hosts mid-game. The bigger threat is baneling busts.
***

**THE PLAN**

1. It’s your personal preference whether to go **Hatch-Gas-Pool** or **Gas-Pool-Hatch**. Either way it’s a good idea to also get a **spine** and extra **queens**.
2. If you suspect an attack incoming, get a baneling nest and additional 1-2 spines. If not, skip it for an earlier 2nd gas.
3. So you’re mining gas. If you want a faster timing attack – get **2 evos** and **1/1** first, followed by **ling speed** and **lair**. This way metabolic boost will finish at the same time as 1/1. If you want to scout and be more safe – get ling speed before upgrades. If you have 1 extractor, start both evos @ 175 gas. If 2, then @ 100 gas.
4. In any case, have a **2nd gas** when the lair is started.
5. When upgrades are on the way and you have saturated both bases, start making **zerglings** and **queens**.
6. Take a **3rd**, spread creep towards it, try to snipe overlords outside your base.
7. Attack as soon as 1/1 is done. Opponent’s spire will usually be done by now, but your goal is to **deny his 3rd base**. You want to send small groups of lings first, just in case opponent has banelings ready. Don’t worry about micro too much. Split your army between all his bases. Other priority targets are queens and drones. Jackpots: spire, spawning pool, upgrading evos. Keep injecting, making lings and some drones. If you see mutas, get few **spores** at each base, continue producing  **queens**.
8. If you started lair right after upgrades, it will finish exactly when 1/1 is done. Start **2/2** immediately. Then get **infestation pit** and start **hive**. It will be ready by the time 2/2 is done. Get **burrow** and **more gas**. Also **hydra den** when you can afford it. Burrow is for denying bases, spotting mutas and protecting infestors.
11. A **4th base** when you start to stockpile minerals. You should have been spreading creep towards it to be able to spore it up.
12. By the time hive is complete, you should have 3 mining bases. Get **3/3** and **adrenal glands**. Build few **ultralisks**, some **infestors** and plenty of **hydras**. This will be your deathball. You may want to kill any overlords around your base with hydras before attacking.
13. Upon seeing your late-game army, he will most likely react with roach/(hydra). When the battle happens, fungal his roaches if he’s kiting. If not, fungal mutas. With 3 armor, your hydras will be able to tank a lot of muta shots.
14. Rebuild on **ultra** **ling** because even *if* your hydras are dead, they have traded efficiently and remaining mutas nor do damage to ultras nor can catch zerglings anyway.


**NOTES**

* **You must not let opponent take a 3rd base.** At least not until you have yours saturated.
* Punish him whenever mutas leave the base. Realize that **it’s you who has the map control** because of your faster army. While muta player must stay defensive lest he dies to counterattacks. Keep splitting your lings between all his bases. For him it will be a pain to deal with.
* Spreading creep is important, because it gives your lings (which are already faster than mutas) a 30% speed boost. It gives you map vision, because you won’t be able to have overlords in the field and it allows you to spore up expansions before they’re even ready.
* If he reacts correctly with brood lords: get a spire, bases around the map, nydus worms, overlord speed, drops, and lots of zerglings. Base trade if necessary.
* If you find out that he is going roaches, still get 1/1, because  lings with 1 armor will tank three +1 roach shots. Get a 3rd and threaten counterattacks, because he won’t be able to leave until his +2 finishes and/or he has a critical mass of roaches. But by the time he does, you should have swarm hosts for defense. Get +1 range and +2 armor, continue with the plan from there. You can also research burrow and try to get lucky.

**EXAMPLES**

Grandmaster zerg Lowko showcasing the beginning on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CJvWurDO_Y

My [replays](http://cl.ly/P6JF) (first two include hive tech). Watch the units lost tab:

* Derelict Watcher – He can’t take his 3rd base all game long. Deathball arrives and his 26 mutas only manage to kill 6 of 21 hydras before dying.

* Newkirk – He loses even with stronger economy which he had after his baneling attack. Secures his 3rd only when I already started my 4th. Ultras come and stomp everything.

* Zerus Prime – just dire consequences of going all-muta...

***

**HOW TO PLAY AGAINST THIS?**

Depends on what you were doing. Scouting is the key. If you see no gasses at natural, only lings being made and 2 upgrading evos, you can know it is coming.

**The standard - Mutalisks**:

* Drop everything and get **+1 melee ASAP** because +1 banelings one-shot any zergling, allowing you to defend much more efficiently. Still, the first timing attack will be a bitch to deal with.

* **+1 ground armor** is also good to keep your lings competitive. You won’t miss that 1.5 muta anyway. In fact, you should continue getting these upgrades and also cancel flier armor for **flier attack** because he doesn’t have mutas anyway. 

* Wall off your natural.

* **Cancel your 3rd base** because you won’t be able to hold to it. Really, it’s impossible unless you spend all your muta bank on ling/baneling. But then again, even with your vanilla banelings he will eventually overcome you. Or worse - if you spend all your money on mutalisks, then you’ll lose all your drones too.
* Only when you get +1 melee (or a lot of mutas) you can begin taking your 3rd again. 
* Don’t leave your base with mutas until you have +1 banelings.
* Either build mutas and try to break him or tech to greater spire and **brood lords**. Or you may try to wall off completely and trade bases.

**The classic - Roach/hydra:**

* Wall off your natural.

* Roach timing attack with at least **+1 range** is good, but if zerglings have +1 armor, they will 
still tank 3 roach shots.

* If your +1 range wasn’t started yet, you could opt for +1 melee and baneling nest.

* Take your 3rd base protected by roaches.

* Build **roaches**, **swarm hosts** and some **hydralisks**.

* Siege up his base closest to you while leaving some defenses at home. Try to kill overseers with hydras.

* You can sprinkle in some **infestors** for fungals, burrow harass and overseer neural’ing.

* **OR** you can skip swarm hosts and do a doom drop because there will be nothing to stop it.


**The mirror – Upgraded ling/baneling:**

* Old school ling/bling wars into ultras.

1368361085.0,33,self.allthingszerg,1e6hlz,Breakdown of each unit for Bronze/Silver players,MynameisIsis,40,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1e6hlz/breakdown_of_each_unit_for_bronzesilver_players/,"This was originally meant to be a comment reply, but got too long. Felt that it might be useful to other new players so I made it into a post. 

Zergling - Requires spawning pool. Extremely cheap in minerals, but expensive in larvae. Weak melee unit that can be upgraded to be very fast. Controls the map early game but falls off late game. Can be used to scout, secure watchtowers, and early game defense. When in conjunction with ultras or hydras, can lock down the opponent's army (run past them then a-move) and tank some damage. Can be put underneath mutas to tank enemy muta bounce shots. Units that can attack air and ground prioritize ground, useful especially when the opponent's anti air is just stalkers. When upgraded with melee attack and the attack speed upgrade at hive tech, decimates mineral lines in seconds.

Baneling - Requires baneling nest. Can be built at hatch tech but speed is researched at lair tech. Morphed from a zergling. One-shot high aoe damage unit that explodes when it attacks or dies. Does not deal friendly damage. Expensive on gas and larvae. Great against clumped up units, like zerglings or marines. Rarely used against protoss, since each of their units have relatively high health and there are fewer of them. Uses: early game aoe, counters zerglings and marines, busts down walls at the front. 

Queen - Requires spawning pool. Built from the hatchery, not larvae. Good early game defense, both ground and air. Has three abilities: 1)inject  larvae - used on a hatchery, will spawn additional larvae after 40 seconds. A queen will have enough energy to do this once every 40 seconds with no energy to spare. 2)spawn creep tumor - A creep tumor ""builds"" in 15 seconds after which it is permanently burrowed and spreads creep within a range of 11. Creep allows zerg buildings to be built upon it and increases the movement speed of most zerg units including enemy zerg. Tumors also provide vision but not detection. Can spawn another creep tumor after it finishes building. As long as the leading edge of tumors hasn't been killed, you can cover the entire map with creep with just a few tumors. 3) Transfuse - heals a target biological unit or building for 125 health. Used on high health units like ultras or on other queens and roaches to defend early game pushes. Uses: early game defense, creep spread, macro in the form of larvae injects. You should have one at each of your first few hatcheries. 

Roach - Requires roach warren. Can be built at hatch tech but needs lair tech to research upgrades, movement speed and the ability to move while burrowed. Roach speed is standard, burrow movement isn't. Tanky, fairly cheap unit that is ranged, but has a short range. Only attacks ground. Uses: A-move unit that has alot of hp for its cost, protects the rest of your army by being up front, great against gateway units and zerglings. Falls off lategame, gas-heavier units perform better but gets you through the midgame. 

Hydralisk - Requires hydralisk den which requires lair. Squishier than the roach but deals more damage and has more range. Can shoot up and down. Susceptible to aoe due to low health; often paired with roaches or zerglings to protect them while they do their damage. Gas heavier than the roach, but still cheap enough to form the core of your army on 3 bases. Upgrades include speed (off of creep only) and range. At your level of play, always get speed before range. Uses: High damage, low hp dps a-move unit. Counters enemy air very well. 

Mutalisk - Requires spire which requires lair. Flying harass unit. Has great speed and regenerates health much faster than other units, but is expensive on the gas. Can shoot up and down. Attacks bounce to other enemy units in a short range; almost half its dps comes from this bounce, making them weaker against big units like thors, battlecruisers, and protoss air (unless they're clumped up). Unlike other harass units, it is still good at direct engagements, but is very squishy. Exponentially more powerful the more you have. Uses: harassing enemy worker lines, scouting/controlling the map, sniping tech bulidings/proxy pylons, air dps unit. 

Corruptor - Requires spire which requires lair. Flying air superiority unit. Only shoots air units but does high damage to them. Expensive on gas but fairly tanky. Can cast corruption on an enemy unit which debuffs them to take 20% more damage for 30 seconds, great for taking out big expensive air units like carriers, tempests, battlecruisers, and broodlords. Can morph into broodlords (described later) Uses: Anti-air unit, useless against anything else. Do note that void rays beat corruptors even though corruptors are supposed to beat other air units. 

Infestor - Requires infestation pit which requires lair. Squishy spellcaster unit with no attack. Very gas expensive. Only unit other than roach that can move while burrowed. Needs no additional upgrade beyond burrow to do so. Upgrades are increased starting energy (recommended if you are making more than a couple of infestors) and neural parasite. Has three abilities: 1)Fungal growth - shoots a projectile that then explodes, rooting enemy units caught in the blast and dealing 30 damage over 4 seconds. Can be cast again before the duration is over to refresh it, trapping the units as long as you have energy. 2)Infested Terran - FREE UNIT! (zerg imba :P) can be spawned in mass numbers to serve as free damage/front line units/anti air. Can be spawned while infestor is burrowed. When spawned, requires 5 seconds to hatch from their egg during which they are vulnerable. 3)Neural Parasite - takes control of an enemy unit for 15 seconds, during which the infestor cannot move or make any other actions. Must be researched before being used. Not used very often anymore, too expensive/risky/innefficient. Uses: Control enemy position and deal damage with fungal, tank and deal damage with infested terrans, and take control of expensive units with neural parasite during battle. 

Swarm Host - Requires infestation pit which requires lair. Expensive unit. Ground siege unit that has no attack of its own, but can burrow (even if burrow has not been researched) to spawn locusts, FREE UNITS that have a short life, low health, can only shoot down, but deal massive amounts of damage. Swarm hosts require detection to be seen by the opponent while buried, but are vulnerable between waves of locusts. Unburrow them and run if you see an attack coming, or protect them with your other units. Can upgrade locust duration time. Uses: Siege unit, not meant to directly engage. Keeps the enemy pinned inside their base and can slowly wittle them down with locusts, which are FREE. 

Viper - Requires hive but no secondary structure. Flying spellcaster unit with no attack. Very expensive on gas and expensive on supply. Has three abilities: 1)Consume - deals 200 damage over 20 seconds to a friendly building to regain 50 energy over the same amount of time. Allows vipers to quickly regain energy and lets you keep less of your supply tied up in units that cannot attack. 2)Abduct - Pretty much, death grip. Grabs and pulls a target unit to the viper with a range of 9. Used to seperate expensive units from the enemy army. Very fun to use :D 3)Blinding Cloud - creates a cloud for 14 seconds under which all ground ranged units have their range shortened to melee range. Affects friendly units too. Great against siege tanks, bio balls, hydras, and protoss ground armies. Double edged sword, be careful and don't walk into it. Uses: Snatches high value units out of the enemy army, such as colossi, thors, and tanks, into your death ball to easily take them out. Controls the enemy with blinding cloud. 

Ultralisk - Requires ultralisk cavern which requires hive. Immensly expensive on minerals, gas, and supply, but oh so worth it. Has a range of 1, which means it's effectively melee but can attack behind a line of lings. Can only attack ground. Attacks splash to nearby units in a 180 arc. Very high dps, very tanky. Cannot be snared, stunned, or mind controlled, and destroys forcefields when walking through them. In other words, cannot be stopped. Can research chitinous plating for even more armor, making the ultra very very tanky. Uses: A-move frontline unit, very good against most ground units. 

Broodlord - Requires greater spire, which is morphed from a regular spire after hive tech. Broodlords are morphed from corruptors. Long range, slow moving siege unit that attacks ground with FREE UNITS called broodlings. Extremely expensive in minerals, gas, supply, and time. Vulnerable to attacks especially from air, since it cannot attack up and is very slow, but deals very high damage to ground units. Uses: Siege unit, not meant for direct engagements. As an attack, spawns broodlings which then attack for the broodlord. Enemy units' AI will target the broodlings before the broodlords; as long as you can protect your broodlords, they'll be trading their units that cost money for your free ones. Late game unit that supplements your army.

EDIT: After feedback, I've decided to put a few more on here.

Overlord - No building requirement. Provides eight supply, which raises the maximum number of units you may have. Supply is capped at 200 regardless of how many overlords you have. Overlords are very slow, unable to run away from any units that can shoot at it, unless they retreat to unpassable ground, such as a cliff or empty air (at least against ground units). Overlords have two researchable upgrades, speed, at hatch tech, and the ability to transport units, at lair tech. Speed is becoming more common to research in the midgame due to the other race's increased ability to take out stray overlords in HotS, but the transport upgrade is rarely used, due to its relatively high cost and low utility compared to mutas or nydus worms (discussed in a moment). Overlords can poop creep at will after lair tech; this has no cost or cooldown, and will spread creep in a small area; however, the overlord is immobile while this ability is used. Uses: Scouting scouting scouting! Overlords can be sent into zerg and protoss bases early game with no consequence, and after being forced out, can still sit in the unpassable ground behind/outside of their base to watch for expansions and possible tech. Overlords with speed are often sacced into the opponent's main as the mid game begins to find out their tech path so zerg can counter it. They can be spread out along the edges of the map to watch for drops, spread in the middle of the map to see incoming pushes (100 minerals is nothing compared to the knowledge of the incoming push), poop creep on the enemy's next base before she takes it to delay it (protoss and terran cannot build on creep) poop creep forward to have something to lay a forward creep tumor on, poop creep to hide tech buildings, and just generally be a badass. http://imgur.com/toWG8jY

Overseer - Requires lair. Morphed from an overlord. Requires small amount of gas. Overseers provide the same amount of supply and have the same health as overlords. They are speedy without the need for speed to be researched, and become even faster with it. They lose the ability to poop creep and transport units but gain several important abilities. First, and most importantly, they are detectors. That means they can detect cloaked and burrowed units, and are the zerg's best method of detection. As an added plus, most units that can cloak can't attack overseers! Next, overseers can spawn changelings. Changelings last two and a half minutes and upon coming close to an enemy unit, transforms into a basic unit of that race and switches color to that opponent's color. Enemy units don't auto attack changelings unless they have detection. If you can get a changeling with the opponents army without them noticing, it's free scouting on their army's position for 2:30! However, if they don't have any of their base units, a lone zealot or a marine in a mech army wandering around their main base is a dead giveaway. Lastly, corruption. Corruption costs a large amount of energy; it is cast upon an enemy building, and shuts it down for 30 seconds. This can be used to slow down critical research, upgrades, or production buildings, like robo facilities/stargates or factories/starports. Be careful to not lose your overseer, this will probably not work more than once in a game. It is a good idea to have a couple of overseers with your army at all times lategame for detection.

Nydus Worm - Requires nydus network which requires lair. Nydus worms are not a unit per se, but do not function like other buildings. After a nydus network is created, it can spawn nydus worms anywhere you have vision. Nydus worms cost a fair amount of gas and take twenty seconds to build. Nydus worms generate creep after being constructed. Both the nydus network and each nydus worm act as an entrance and exit to the network, allowing near instant travel to far flung corners of the map. A nydus worm can be destroyed and the units ""inside"" are safe, so long as the nydus network is still alive. Uses: Getting around the map in an instant, putting one in a mineral line to attack with zerglings while your army attacks the front, reinforcing far flung bases (opponent brings her whole army to kill a hatch, load up all drones in the nydus to save them, or send your army through to intercept hers) ",,False,,t5_2tkq6,1368380973.0,,,True,t3_1e6hlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1e6hlz/breakdown_of_each_unit_for_bronzesilver_players/,

They are T1 and only cost minerals so are a very good mineral dump Zerg are often floating on too many minerals anyway. 2 Queens can easily take out early oracles/void rays/banshees because of the transfuse ability. A few queens with a spine wall are very effective at holding any early pressure because of transfuse. They don't cost larve so if you have spare minerals - Make a few. Also I have noticed lower ranked players (myself included) never spread enough creep. Creep spread is a vital part to zerg stratergy.

Thanks for your patience guys.

So I'm at home chilling with my girlfriend. After an awesome sexy time she tells me ""You talk about starcraft a LOT, why don't you show me a match?"" So I think ""Omg this one's a keeper"" and start a game.

I would have loved to crush some guy with an awesome army of Brood lords / Infestors, and this terran guy wasn't aggressive at all. I tried to scout him a little bit, but he was full of turrets so I had no luck. (Whatever, scouting is one of the problems but that's not the point).

Everything's going smooth, I get 3/4 bases then transition to Brood-lords / Infestors and max my army. Then he walks out. OH MY GOD he had SO MANY THORS, but I had something like 20 BL and a lot of infestors, so I thought ""Heh take that dude"".

I was CRUSHED like a little bitch in front of my girlfriend. It cannot happen again.






TL;DR:
How do I deal with such an amount of thors?
Forget about the macro / scouting and everything, I know there's a LOT I should improve on, but let's just focus on the engagement. Was my army ""good enough"", or maybe I should have had like twice as many units somehow?

But that's neither here nor there.  I have an over 75% win rate against zerg.  So here's my tip:  Don't try to emulate the pros by going muta/ling!

It is a amazing composition at high levels, because those players have the ability (APM) to be constantly harassing and doing damage with the fast units, while also macroing on the back end.  But in silver/bronze, you just don't have the APM.  

The thing is, 100 gas can buy one muta or two hydras.  Two hydras slaughter one muta in a direct engagement.  For the mutas to be cost effective, they have to be doing economic damage, which means they have to be controlled.  So what ends up happening is either, my opponent slips on control and the mutas fly into a direct engagement with my hydra ball and die...or, they attempt to harass but slip on macro and I win that way.

I think a lot of lower level zergs would do a lot better by focusing on macro and using units that don't require a lot of APM to be cost effective. It's so easy to a-move with a roach/hydra army, do lots of damage, and macro at the same time.  Try that with mutas, and they die.

*Obviously this formatting isn't great, but I'm clueless on how to do it better on reddit*

Hey guys, Savior here again with another guide on the ZvP MU, this time we’re focusing on the WonWonWon, and a build that works fantastically against it!
I’ve seen a bunch of Aussie zergies here doing quick little bios so I figured this would be an ideal opportunity to tell you a bit about myself before I jump into the guide.



**Bio:**

I’m an English Zerg living in Japan/NZ. Family lives in Japan, I’m at Uni in NZ. I play at high masters on kr, and I have a variety of unorthodox aggressive builds, to passive strong macro builds. I plan on writing guides every so often for /r/starcraft and /r/atz, specifically focusing on ZvP which I regard as my specialty. I’m in the process of writing a ZvP Ultra Bane guide, but due to being a bit sick I’ve put it on hold. This is a fair bit shorted to write out than that as it’s just a 4 min period of the game ^.^.
At present I don’t stream, however I will have the means to do so in the next 2 weeks, after which you can find me at twitch.tv/savior777, streaming all hours! I hope you enjoy reading this guide, and together we can become Zerg bosses.



**The beginning:**

First of all, your macro has to be fantastic. If you aren’t hitting 70 supply at 8 mins you won’t be able to hold it ever, or any other all in for that matter. Ideally you want to hit 3 base saturation, 66 drones, as we’ll be using all our gasses to get as much vespene out as possible. 
Now for the basis of a standard ZvP opener, you can check out my ZvP 80 Supply at 8 mins guide (http://www.sc2sea.com/showthread.php?p=130872).

It’s common knowledge nowadays that Immortal Sentry pushes out at 8:50 ideally, and hits around 10 mins. That gives us 2 mins of army production before it hits. Now the way my injects line up from my guide, gives me 3 inject cycles in between that time period.



At 8 mins you have to start pumping lings, rally them close to the opponents base, but not where they will cross paths with Immortal Sentry. 8:30 we throw down a baneling nest. Now, I go Ultra bane in ZvP so it goes down then anyway, if you overlord scout, you can throw it down reactively in response to Immortal Sentry.

http://tldr.me/1q0tt3g.png



**The middle:**


Upon seeing the push moving out, take the drones mining minerals in your 3rd and put them in your nat. Take the drones in your nat, and make 8 or so spines, and continue to produce these. Don’t make more lings once the Immortal Sentry has pushed out, you need those minerals elsewhere.



With your first wave of lings that you made, make 15 banes, and baneling bust their front wall. In total you have approximately 50 zerglings to assist you in your base trade. 

http://tldr.me/13vytw2.png

What should you be killing (In order of priority)

1.	The Cybercore, reasons will be made obvious shortly..

2.	The Probes, no income, no more army…

3.	The Production, no buildings, no more army…

4.	The Nexus, if they get revealed they are sooooo done for.

http://tldr.me/ucpdrd.png



Why the Cybercore? Being the crafty fucker I am, I left out what we’re doing techwise at home. The moment your Lair finishes, throw down a Spire (in your main).



**The end:**


Due to the fact that we’ve been mining gas off 3 bases for a significant amount of time, you should be able to make 10 mutas straight away, and maintain constant production of them. This ultimately leaves them with 8 sentries, 7 stalkers, 3 sentries and maybe a zealot fighting into a wall of 10+ spines, and your mutas. Of course if you haven’t had enough time to get a WALL of spines, so maybe only 6 or so, just send your mutas to try and base trade right away.




When the push gets to your spine wall, pull your 2 queens down to help with that little bit of dps, sometimes your macro may have slipped allowing you a transfuse as you have to do so much in a short frame of time.




So just a quick summary is in order:

Baneling nest at 8:30

Spire once Lair finishes approx. 9:00

Pump lings until around 9:20

Morph spines/drone transfer the second ImmoSentry pushes out

Morph 15 banes

Bling bust, focus down cyber core with your lings

Make 10+ mutas when Spire finishes at ~11:00



http://tldr.me/8veo20.png


**Conclusion:**


Personally, when I play my opening well and hit mid 70s, I haven’t lost using this build. Macro is such an important part of holding Immo Sentry, no matter what strategy you use to try and defeat it, I feel my build is just better at providing a higher win rate at defeating it.



At the moment I can only find 1 replay of me doing this, I’ve been ill recently which has cut back on my playing and I cant dig up any other ImmoSentry holds. If you want me to get your some more, drop me a pm and I’ll send you some as I get them.

This tip is somewhat obvious, but has helped me more than just hearing ""a loss isn't a big deal"" or ""pretend it's a computer"":

I played strictly team games because 1v1s were just way too stressful. Not knowing what to prepare for, not knowing what the other player is doing, when to attack, being too afraid to find out. I would scout but not really know what to do with what little information I saw. I would avoid 1v1s, even unranked, like the plague. 

What's really helped me get into games is having a strict build to run. As long as everything I do is written down in front of me, including when I attack, it takes a lot of the ""impending doom"" out of it. 

It removes the ""omg what should I be doing right now what is he doing is he about to come kill me"" thoughts and makes me feel somewhat less responsible for how the game goes. For example, if I'm doing a mutalisk build, I already know from the start that if someone rushes me I will get eaten. If and when that happens, it doesn't phase me nearly as much. I have pre-chosen to take that risk, and therefore I'm not overwhelmed with ""what if he rushes me what do I do"" anxiety. 

Furthermore, it helps develop good mechanics and you can always take yourself off of auto-pilot, and that's where the improvement comes from!

Just thought someone here might be able to use another tool in the toolbox to get themselves into games. Good luck have fun!

**TLDR: Have a build that allows the first 12ish minutes of the game to be 100% scripted. Knowing exactly what you're going to do no matter what the opponent might do takes a lot of pressure off of you.**


Edit: I'm mostly targeting people in **gold and below**, and offering a way to ease themselves into the game. Also, obviously not every game is going to allow you to see your ""plan"" to completion, but the hardest part is clicking the ""Find Match"" button. Having a general game plan helps a great deal. Please share any other tips to manage the anxiety, I could definitely use some.

Looking to get a few students under my belt who get up to masters. I really want dedicated individuals who will stick with me and post their progress, from bronze to masters or anything in between.

If you are Bronze - Diamond and want to hit masters, Please check out my page - it has all my info on it, you can message me and even book a time.

I honestly never could consider charging $ to teach a game I love, considering I also don't have results or a TON of time, it makes sense.

If you have spare time, live in central time zone or have a flexible schedule, and want to improve (Below masters) just message me. I am putting myself out there since ATZ has always been a resource for me.

Sort by ""Rating"" if you want someone higher quality like Soma on the same website - he's a Tri-master who is much more comfortable coaching on all races. I had a 2 hour lesson with him and it did wonders. I can only reliably coach Zerg to masters, other races are shakier.

PS. While I am getting a good response to this thread, How it goes is everyone signs up, half the people forget so I only get a few students. 

Keep signing up! I have room every evening!!

I can only speak English also = (

PPS.

This offer isn't expiring anytime soon - I don't plan on stopping until I have a few masters players - chances are most of you won't be able to have a regular schedule you can follow, that's OK.

My first Student was shafted by me because my internet is down yesterday and today - it's a roomate thing and it's being solved if you are reading this.

I expect it to be up by tonight at 8 PM,

This is not a normal occurrence and once it's up it's up, it's good for months - we are just getting a new account setup.

Apologies to the student I could not help, I should have expected instant scheduling.

To everyone else, keep signing up, I added a new suggestion where you should really zip up 10 replays and send them to me if you want an actual personalized lesson - That way I can tell your crutches and your strengths and work from there.

Cheers


PSA

Friday - Saturday Students were denied a lesson because my internet has been down since wednesday  - I posted this and setup everything at my work internet, not realizing what a goof I was.

INTERNET IS BACK UP AS OF 10:30 AM SATURDAY FRESH START RIGHT GUYS? =P

I have opened up MASSIVE amounts of time on Monday and Wednesday to account for this internet outage. I have those two days off, during which time we can make up for my fail internet.

I have also opened up evening hours on Sunday. I am busy in the morning and then have the entire evening.

PLEASE sign up, I am hoping to have a blast this weekend with all of you and making up for my Thursday/Friday failures by having you reschedule on Monday and wednesday!

1367956263.0,30,self.allthingszerg,1dvrmf,"ZvT, what I do.",masterdz522,37,7,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1dvrmf/zvt_what_i_do/,"Ok, it is quite obvious that a lot of you are upset about the current state of ZvT. On the other hand, I'm probably having the best time in ZvT since that one time I beat a GM Terran in WoL. However, that is another story. I'm a mid-master Zerg whose ID is BaByEaTeR.527. I'm going to lay out what I do, and you can determine for yourself if you would also like to utilize this information.

Foremost, the most important thing in a playstyle is an opener. Now, for the ""opener"", you want to go hatch first, as always, and drone scout for a proxy. These are less common now, but better safe than sorry. Go for the standard 16 pool, and go 16 gas. The reason for this gas is that the reaper openers are almost always the go-to opener for the Terran. If they avoid this opener, it is OK because you aren't behind. As always, pull out all of your drones at 100 gas. This gas is only for speed, unless you want to do a baneling bust (which I don't suggest). After taking your drones out of gas, I queue up a queen at my natural and another one directly following, as creep spread has always been essential for ZvT.

As a good Zerg, you should be scouting or at least have an idea of what your opponent is doing. If they are playing normal and taking a third base/macroing up, you are free to keep making drones. As you are approaching full saturation at your natural, add your 3 drones back into gas, take 2 more gases at your natural and start evo chambers. The reason for this is that the early bio pushes that Terrans have been using recently is easily shut down if you have proper upgrades. After getting your gases, take a third. As always, your next 100 gas should be spent on lair, and then a baneling nest. You don't need a super fast lair anymore, as upgrades are more important.

This is where you start being ""agressive"". The reason there are quotation marks around that word is because you don't REALLY want to be aggressive. You just want to get map control and let the Terran know that you have map control. Thus, you will see whenever they move out. Don't overcommit to ling production, as behind this you should be droning up your third, making a macro hatch, and getting a spire, as well as continuing upgrades(including baneling speed and burrow for obvious reasons). Along with this spire, I tend to get pneumatised carapace (overlord speed) to help with picking off widow mines. Mutas can snipe 1-2 widow mines if you have overseers with them.

After your third is droned, it should be in your best interest to take a 4th. The more bases you have, the better off you will be in the late game. As your 2-2 nears halfway completion, you should be building an infestation pit. Your late game will, obviously, require hive tech. You should always aim for hive tech, as widow mines shut down most high-agression states.

What you should be doing with your units is very important. As your muta flock builds, you should send the first few to his mineral line. Personally, I send the first 9 to do some damage. However, as the game continues I tend to have a total of 16-20. These, initially, should be used to fend off drops. When my hive tech is starting, I tend to start building static defense to do this. This leaves your mutas to do counter attacks and pokes at his economy. If you lose some, it is OK, as they will be replaced by infestors. Also, when you are moving your army around the map, ALWAYS lead with a small pack of 6-10 lings to spot for mine explosions, etc.

When your infestation pit finishes, you should start a hive and the energy upgrade. These will NOT be used as the backbone of your army. You do not want more than 6-8 of them at any given time. They are support units in every function. Your late game should be ultralisk-centric. This is when you can start trying to kill your opponent. Ultras LITERALLY do not give a shit about widow mines. The only things that even faze them are marauders. Your composition should slowly move from ling, muta, festor, ultra, baneling to just ultra infestor with a few lings/banes mixed in. Ultralisks are amazing now, and with good fungals they are unstoppable. You shouldn't lose the game if it gets to this stage, unless they max on battlecruisers while you're having an epileptic seizure or something. Don't be afraid to attack into the Terran if you think you are vastly ahead. I suggest mixing in banelings to break walls if you plan to do this, though. Obviously, upgrades should have made it to 3-3 adrenal long ago.

This is all if the Terran decides to go to late game. A lot of what you are having trouble with is widow mine + bio agression. From my experience with both T and Z in this matchup, I think I'm close to being able to beat this almost always. Remember when I said to get queens? Yeah, I'm pretty sure creep spread is the actual key to beating this. Also, you NEED to make sure that widow mines don't get money hits on your banelings. Most of it is your job, split your banelings before engagements like a terran would split marines. If you need to sacrifice a base, sacrifice it. The biggest thing I think zergs aren't doing is keeping tabs on their army, and one of the best ways to do this is through creep spread. If you know where they are and what they are doing, you can get a full surround. This should allow you to get a full surround and destroy your army when you are ready. Another thing is if their agression comes late, if you get out ultras in the middle they will just die. Many Terrans don't prepare for ultralisks ahead of time.

Anyhow, this is what I've been doing. I hope it can be helpful. Sadly, I don't currently have any replays as I forgot to turn on the save all replays feature. However, you can hit me up in game or on Skype (masterdz522) and I can try to help you. I'm not a perfect player. Hell, I'm not even a good player, but I hope that I can help. Also, most of the concepts I used were adapted from pro gamers' play.

EDIT: As pointed out by NerVeLon, in the late game it can be useful to get a few corruptors to deal with drops and even turn into brood lords in the SUPER late game, if it should get to that point.

I'm addicted to the zerg race and playing the best I can possibly play! Improving is my goal above simply winning. If winning is the goal I could just learn a quick cheese and practice that until perfected. 

I really enjoy seeing my students improve. Most of my students have reported back a few days later reporting a promotion! I know this isn't absolutely necessarily a result of my coaching alone, but every student I had has left satisfied with the session. 

If you want some coaching from me please email me at nickyboy909@hotmail.com. or message me on bnet and we'll work out a time that works for the both of us! You can add my skype as well it is nickyboy9091.

How the coaching will go:
My coaching sessions start with looking at 1 or 2 replays of yours or you playing against me or the computer so I can get a feel for your playstyle prior to beginning. I will then pick at your style and point out where, what, how and why to improve. I explain why it is important to focus on that specific aspect, then we do some live coaching vs an AI opponent or one of your friends around your level or I will do a demonstration of the build if necessary. It tends to be better if we focus on one specific matchup but it is possible to do all three, they'll just be less in depth of course. All this is absolutely free! All I ask is that you consider donating to my paypal if you want to support me and help me improve as a coach, a player and a caster. Almost all the money would be going to buying coaches of my own to help me improve my own coaching and playing! I want to make it clear that there is absolutely NO obligation here. just donate if you want to give me your support and can spare the moneyz... yes i know you can support me but not be able to afford to donate and thats fine!!! like i said only donate if you want to! my paypal is nick.murphy01@hotmail.com
Also, I have a youtube page where I post casts once a day and am currently working on a tutorial series for zerg. The first of these tutorials will be how to hatch first vs protoss so stay tuned for that! I'm just getting into casting and could use the feedback. My youtube is www.youtube.com/user/nickyboy909 if you're interested. If you donate I can give you a shoutout in one of my videos if you're okay with that hahaha.

Fast forward twenty minutes into the game with my 2-base 60 Roach, and he just obliterated me. He then said that he was a platinum Zerg and that he was just playing around with Terran. What happened next made me fall instantly in love with the Starcraft 2 community, he gave me lots of tips on how to play the Zerg generally and then he said in chat:

Terran: I'm going to let you have this one

Terran: :)

I didn't even have enough time to shout a thank you in the chat and I was astonished.

recently, stephano has been playing ling only, extreme aggresion on his stream.This really inspired me so i went on my smurf (diamond) and tried out.
IT IS AMAZING.

You basically get only 1 geysir, after the pool, go to quick 3bases, get speed and double upgrades as you get 250 gas. next 100 gas are lair+2nd geysir.
when 1/1 is finished, youll have enough for 2/2.
next gas goes into infestationpit----&gt; hive for 3/3, if it gets that far into ultras.
Alternatively, you can stay on 2/2 and get drop instead, which stephano showed on his stream to kill turtley terrans with highground tanks.

He gets mass hatches, about 5 hatches on 3 bases with full mineral saturation.
as he gets more money, he adds expansions/macro hatches.

basically, its that simple. thats the build. you just spend all your money on lings and constantly run in preventing his 3rd and killing as much army/worker as you can.

http://drop.sc/298308 A replay of me trying this style for the first time.


ITS REALLY FUN! and most terrans dont expect you to just keep rallying lings over and over. My opponent stated in the Replay that he expected me to stop, but i didnt, so eventually i was able to overpower him once i got drop.

IF you just cant kill him because he turtles TOO HARD, get all geysirs and get broods and infestors, youll have a huge advantage if you deny the third for long enough.

I'd love some discussion on this style, i'll try it tomorrow on my main master account, but since stephano pulls it off vs gm koreans, i guess it works vs master players easily :pp",,False,,t5_2tkq6,1359060993.0,,Master EU,True,t3_177m54,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/177m54/stephanos_mass_ling_zvt_style/,

So today I bought WoL, and played 14 games. My first victory on the ladder came from some dude that quit ten seconds into the game, which doesn't really count as far as I'm concerned, and I was looking for a real, legit victory on the ladder before I went to bed tonight. Thankfully, I finally got matched up against someone who is nearly as bad as I am. 

Thanks to some advice here I managed to find a 14-14 extractor-pool opening, which I practiced against the weak AI until I sort of had it down. There were still some hiccups, but I managed to get a decent intro build. Unfortunately, I kept getting crushed, until I decided, ""okay, one more game, then bed."" 

This was one for Husky's Bronze League Heroes. I ""macroed"" -- by which I mean I built about 140 zerglings -- until the point where I had about 150 supply massing up again a Bronze League Terran until I decided I didn't have anything to lose. He was walled in pretty well with TWO layers of supply depots backed up by a bunch of marines. Fuck it -- I went in anyway, stupidly busted down the front with my zergling-only army and got creamed. 

I wasn't about to gg. No sir. I lost my army, but hell, what do I have to lose at this point? Hmmmm.... what to do though...? I know! Baneling bust. I went mass baneling, overran the base, and it was jailbreak time. He must have gotten up to go pee or something. I didn't care. I wan IN this time baby. And boy did it ever feel sweet overrunning his base, taking out most of what he had. 

After I decimated him, he didn't gg, so I picked six of my speedlings and sent them on potential suicide duty to go to each mineral patch to find this dude. He went to some wonky location way away from his natural spawning area. I will never forget the sacrifice of that one, poor, heroic zergling. 

So he was weak, but I wasn't sure I could actually break through. Hmmm... Do I macro up to ensure my first true ladder victory while I am on three bases against a very weak opponent who is only one base? Inject larva? Build a roach warren, hydra den, or even go for an infestor siege?  Haha nope. I just sling my balls over my shoulder, make a few more banelings, and overrun him. 

This whole game was a true comedy of errors. To be honest, we are both bad players. Very bad. But you know what, who cares? You know what matters? I had fun. And I won my first real ladder match. Now I can sleep knowing that 1) I am getting better, and 2) I won the last game I played. 

Who cares how much I suck? I enjoyed it. I won't be in Master's League any time soon. Hell, I won't be in Silver anytime soon. But I had fun, and I did improve. I'm hitting injects while macroing, albeit haphazardly, and I'm getting down hitting the right keys to make things happen. 2-12. That'll get you the number one pick in the NFL most years! Tomorrow I'm gonna win another game I hope, and if I do that one win will make up for the many I will lose. 

Seriously, this game is bad ass. My only regret is that I did not save the reply to send to Husky. Next time.

Here's the Widow Mine I wanted to see, thought I saw, and still wish to see:

Unstable Payloads beyond the first one should be constructed much like a Brood War Scarab or Carrier Interceptor (capped at one payload of course), for at least the same cost of the mine itself. When like this, Terran makes a mine, burrows it, it goes off, it basically pays for itself, you SEE the interaction on the map, and it's now up to the Terran player to maintain that position by re-arming the mine for a fair price to re-assert control in said position.

Having a 30 second rebuild time on additional Unstable Payloads would be fair. It would cost precious resources and slow a player down who opts to mass-maintain an army of mines significantly. 30 seconds is also enough time to re-arm the mine before the next wave of units arrive. Taking into consideration the average unit's build time, and map travel associated with pushing with them cross-map, 30 seconds would be a great rebuild time. This gives a Terran a 10 second window after detonation before the mine starts becoming inefficient and vulnerable (compared to its current stats in beta). The more mines in more places, the harder it is to maintain. There must be a difficulty curve proportionate to the amount on the field, because the micro and attention to actually tread through them safely is comparatively higher.

For proper aesthetics, empty Widow Mines would have a blue light signalling that its Unstable Payload is spent and needs to be reloaded, this color changes when firing, and is visible with detection as usual until armed. When armed, its default red light signals that its armed. This would let both players know what the current state of of the mine is, and each player can respond accordingly.


TLDR;

Pay a replacement cost to re-arm already-positioned mines like Interceptors (max cap for payload per mine remains as 1). Make sure you know what you're doing before massing them, because they will eat into your economy by maintaining high numbers of them and will require attention.

Less mines/cared for mines = more efficient mines

More mines = you better have good APM and the economy to support them

When empty, change the lights on them to blue, and when armed, to red. Allow them to be readable and interactive in this way for both players.",,False,,t5_2tkq6,1361551544.0,,,True,t3_190ibk,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/190ibk/since_widow_mines_seem_to_be_a_hot_topic/,

While I think being promoted it awesome, whether or not such posts should be permitted or not is a different issue. This post is about the discrimination of votes for posts. It is obvious that getting into higher leagues requires more skill, but remember that a promotion is still a promotion. It is the gratification of hard work, and often times players feel the need to give a shoutout to those who helped them achieve it, i.e. this subreddit.

For those of you who frequent this subreddit, you've probably noticed that the higher the league, the more upvotes and comments the post gets. This post is just a reminder to remember that most of us didn't start in masters league, and each promotion felt rewarding. If you don't feel that these posts should be permitted, say something in this thread and perhaps we can come to an agreement one way or another. In conclusion though, I don't think people should downvote posts saying they got into silver or gold league and upvote happily for masters. Feel free to agree or disagree, but please explain your thoughts :)

In short, I would suggest swapping around Ctrl and Shift for ""Add to Control Group X"" and ""Create Control Group X"". Simply put, this method reduces the physical steps needed for some important tasks and also just ""feels"" a hell of a lot more natural.

To demonstrate exactly what I mean, lets take a look at creating units and then adding them to Control Group 1:

Old way:
&gt;
1. Select Larvae, make units
2. Hold down Ctrl
3. Left-Click eggs
4. Release Ctrl
5. Hold down Shift
6. Press the 1 key
7. Release Shift

New way:
&gt;
1. Select Larvae, make units
2. Hold down Ctrl
3. Left-Click eggs
4. Press the 1 key
5. Release Ctrl

As you can see, not having to move from Shift to Ctrl saves us precious time and effort. This is also very nice when you're adding active units to Control Groups:

Old way:
&gt;
1. Hold down Ctrl
2. Left-Click on unit
3. Release Ctrl
4. Hold down Shift
5. Press the 1 key
6. Release Shift

New way:
&gt;
1. Hold down Ctrl
2. Left-Click on unit
3. Press the 1 key
4. Release Ctrl

If you're an old dog like me, the idea of making this change can be a bit daunting. However, it was surprisingly easy. The good news is that I never realized how little I actually needed to use Ctrl to create new Control Groups because using Shift works the same when the Control Group is empty. 

If you're a new dog, I would suggest starting with this immediately. In addition, I would suggest [changing your Caps Lock key to function as Ctrl.](http://geekwith.com/profiles/blogs/disable-the-capslock-key-in).",,False,,t5_2tkq6,False,,,True,t3_1148b1,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1148b1/i_urge_you_abandon_using_shift/,

Writing this post to warn you about following strictly what the pros are doing and what they aren't doing. It seems like many people in here believe, that because it doesn't work in pro games, it wont work in lower leagues either. One example is today, when someone wrote that Rouch/Hydra isn't viable in ZvT, because some good zerg player got rolled over using it yesterday in WCS or something. Please try out the strategies yourself instead of completely relying on whether the pros can make it work or not. Many strategies will work in the non-pro division even though it's not used in GSL, WCS, DH ect. Basically what i am saying is to take everything with a grain of salt. Please continue to be inspired by professional players and try out their strategies, but don't be afraid to  do something that the pros don't do or often loose while doing.

# Esper's ZvP 12 Pool Spire + Swarm Host Build

## Overview
Hey Zergies, I'm a mid to mid/high Master's League Zerg player in NA.  I'm honestly crap at this game, my macro is inconsistent and I'll catch myself making really stupid decisions at times, but I still feel like I can contribute to lower league players working on moving up the ladder.  The basis of this build order is to always know what our Protoss opponent is doing.  We want to react to early pressure, identify all-ins (not just that it's coming but exactly what's coming), and punish greedy play.  Protoss units are powerful and cost-efficient so to battle this we're going to focus on using Swarm Hosts as a source of free units tipping the cost-efficiency scale back in our favor.  The biggest benefit of this build is that I feel it's very flexible.  Since we place such a large commitment on scouting we are always aware of threats and can react appropriately.  I hope this is helpful to anybody who uses the build to success.  I also think it's important as Zergs to consider alternative builds because that's how you spur innovation and creative thinking.

## Why 12 Pool?
I feel this small section is necessary as most higher league players are going to hear 12 pool and automatically dismiss the guide.  12 Pools are too slow to punish Nexus first builds and not as economically focused as 14/15 pools or hatch first.  It's a personal preference of mine, I've been using 12 pools in one form or another since the start of WoL as a response to the small maps like Steppes of War and Xel'Naga Caverns.  If you want to move the pool timing back and adjust that's fine I don't think it will affect the general feel of the build, but I'm comfortable with 12 so it's what I'm using.

## The Basic Build
Here's the basic outline of the build up until approximately 50-60 supply.  I don't go any further than right past Lair because there is a great deal of variance that can happen from that point forward.

* 9 Overlord
* 12 Spawning Pool
* 16 Overlord
* Queen + Extractor + Zerglings (I build my extractor so it times exactly with the finishing of the Spawning Pool).
    * Only put 2 drones in gas when it completes
* 19 or 20 Hatchery
* 21 Hatchery
* Start Zergling Speed @ 100 gas
* After you have 17 drones at your main, rally to your natural
* Build Queen @ natural
* Overlord Speed @ 100 gas
* Build Queen @ third
* 40-45 supply, build 2 Extractors @ natural, place drone into gas @ main (now there are 3 in gas there)
   * I normally line this up about 5-10 seconds after the queen at my natural finishes
* Start Lair @ ~100 gas (I say approximately 100 gas because you want to prioritize drone waves over the 5-10 seconds extra for the Lair)
* When Overlord Speed finishes, send an Overlord through their base to look @ tech
* **READ ""The 7:30 Mark"" Section**
* When Lair finishes, put down Infestation Pit + Spire
* Begin Locust Research + 1-2 Evolution Chambers
* When Spire finishes, make Corruptors then start +1 attack
* If safe, move out with 5+ Swarm Hosts.  Otherwise wait for Corruptors then move out.
* Continue producing Swarm Hosts, Corruptors, and some Zerglings
* Use your mineral excess to start a 4th base
* Continue with Ranged/Carapace and Flyer Attack upgrades
* Victory Screen!


## The 7:30 Mark
This is the most pivotal point in the game ZvP.  It's when your speed Overlord(s) get a full peak in their base and you'll generally see one of the following scenarios:

* **Mass Gateways** - This is normally going to be a zealot/stalker 2-base all-in.  The other way to see this coming is if you don't see any gas at their natural you can assume they're going to hit you with this pressure.  You won't have the time for the Spire/Infestation Pit to finish; instead put down a Hydralisk Den and spines at your natural.  Continue building Zerglings and the most important decision is to make sure you do not lose drones.  If your third dies then make sure it's only the hatchery, but if you can equalize 2-base vs. 2-base they are significantly behind in tech.  Re-expand to your third and put down the Infestation Pit for Ling/Hydra/Swarm Host.
* **Robo + Gateways** - Two things are important here: (1) is the Robo building or done and (2) how many Gateways are there?  If the Robo is done, building, and being chrono'd you're most likely going to see an Immortal/Sentry all-in.  If the Robo is completing or you don't see more than 5 gateways expect an expansion build.  In the case of the Immortal/Sentry all-in it depends on the map but I would suggest Infestation Pit + Hydralisk Den instead of Spire.  Again spine your natural, your goal is just to deflect the attack.  If it's a Robo expand smile and continue with the build.
* **Stargate + Gateways** - This is going to be a common sight, it's important to know if/when they stop Phoenix production and switch to Void Rays.  Also 1 Stargate vs 2 Stargate needs to be identified.  1 Stargate is not too scary, if you see 2 Stargates make sure to put at least 1 spore in each base (I prefer 2 personally) and you'll have to keep your Corruptors/Swarm Hosts back while you build up a slightly larger number than you normally move out with.  Use Zerglings to deny any attempts at a third base as they'll have a pretty weak ground army.  The easiest way to deny is to really keep an eye for that probe.  A handful of Zealots can deflect the Zerglings from a building Nexus, but if it doesn't get put down in the first place it's a much easier delay.  Regardless, continue with the build.
* **Stargate + Robo** - This is also common, but it's the greedy version.  This player has a very low Gateway count and is basically racing for Void Ray Colossus.  Identify how many Phoenixes they make, if they don't make more than 2-3 then 5-8 Mutalisks can do some wonders after you get enough Corruptors/Zerglings to protect your Swarm Host's sieged position.  The most important thing to understand is this build is so greedy in getting tech out that if you don't punish it right away be very ready to fall back with your sieged position.  If they crush your army you're not going to recover from this.
* **Twilight + Gateways** - This means 1 of 3 things: (1) DTs, (2) Blink Stalker, (3) rushing to Storm/Archons.  If you see this tech your Spire won't be as necessary so focus on Zergling/Swarm Host production and make sure you put down a macro Hatchery.  Also be sure to evolve an Overseer at each base and build a spine.  If you see the Templar Archives make sure your Swarm Host aren't too clumped up.  Spread them a bit laterally and staggered also.


## Tips &amp; Tricks
So the build is fairly straight forward I feel.  The two gas in geyser is a bit awkward if you're not used to it, a lot of times it's easy to forget to put the third drone there, but there are still lots of little tricks that really make this build run smoothly.

* Remember you can rally eggs individually.  After I get 16 drones at my main I move my rally to my natural minerals.  Likewise as soon as my extractors at the natural finish I rally all 3 Hatcheries to my third even though my natural is not fully saturated.  After you make the larva into drones, queue the proper number to the respective base's minerals
* Drones and Zerglings are the same thing.  One is for economy one is for safety.  While I give hard numbers for the first portion of the build after that sometimes flexibility is required.  You're not bound to make an entire production cycle only Zerglings or only Drones, a lot of times with the third queen inject larva I'll split them Zerglings/Drones if I see an early Mothership Core.
* Be wary of your unit rally.  Generally speaking I like to set my unit rally right into my minerals as well.  Since I ctrl group my eggs into my army, the rally ends up being for Overlords mostly.  You don't want to get caught with too many Overlords out on the map with a bunch of Phoenixes.  That being said don't forget to hop to each base and spread those Overlords for scouting.  Because you get Overlord speed you can pull them back in pretty quickly.  The Overlords should be covering any places you suspect a proxy pylon.
* Drone out, Drone in.  What I mean by this is when you make a building your immediate next action should be to queue up a drone and rally to the base where you made the structure.  Keeping 16 Drones on minerals is super important and should always be a priority.
* After you make your extractors, take the next opportunity to queue up 3 Drones and rally them to the building Extractor.  An Extractor takes 30 seconds to build, a Drone takes 17.  Factor in travel distance and it's pretty darn close and has a ""set it and forget it feel""
* Once your siege position is established rally 2-4 Overlords to it so you can drop creep in front of the Swarm Hosts.  Make sure you hold position with them and do NOT, I repeat DO NOT overextend with your army just to save one.  If they kill one so be it, but maintaining a strong position is paramount.
* When you build your fourth base (or any base really) rally 2 building drones to the base and use them to make extractors.  Next production cycle make 6 drones and rally 3 to each geyser.  You want to be mining gas immediately when  the Hatchery finishes.
* Micro'ing Swarm Hosts can be kind of clunky sometimes.  I set my Swarm Hosts to their own control group, but I almost never use that control group to control them; I just want to know how many I have and to check their rallies.  When you make the Swarm Hosts, rally the eggs to your siege position and add them to the control group.  NEVER use the control group to burrow them.  Always Ctrl-click the unburrowed one to burrow, and make sure to spam that rally forward while they're burrowing.  Otherwise you may have your Swarm Hosts burrow and the Locusts don't go anywhere.  If you see a rally line that extends backwards beyond your siege position it means you have a burrowed Swarm Host behind (probably on rally).  Find it and move it forward.
* If you find yourself in a stalemate situation where you're not busting their third but they can't move out either then take a cluster of Swarm Hosts and move them over to attack the natural.  Your Corruptors/Zerglings are going to have much better mobility so you can bounce back and forth.
* Use your Corruptors to snipe Colossus.  Even if they have Stalkers under, trading 1-3 Corruptors is well worth killing a Colossus.  Remember, if they're going Stalkers to defend their Colossus your Zerglings/Locusts will melt his army.  This piece is very important and it's why I advocate going Spire instead of Hydralisk Den.  The ability to control the army compositions is vital to making sure you don't get run over by an eventual deathball.

## Replays
I have 6 replays included of me doing the build.  You'll notice my macro is kind of bad, but I manage.  I didn't include any replays of me losing, not because I'm embarrassed or anything, but because they're almost always because my macro slipped or I didn't react properly.  I looked through them all and that's mostly where the reactions in the ""7:30 Mark"" section have come from.

Lots of interesting fast lair openings as well as some cool all-ins from Life. Hopefully these will be helpful
__________________________________________________

Life vs MC Game 1 Fast Lair w/ Hydras

9 Overlord

14 Pool

~15 Hatch

Queens

3rd Hatch @~4:00

Gas

Queen at third

Zergling Speed

Build lings as needed

Lair @ 7:00

2x gas in main and 1 at natural

Evolution Chamber (Life builds spores in mineral lines due to MC's Stargate opener)

+1 and Hydra Den when Lair finishes

Hydra speed

Start pumping out tons of Hydras and Lings and attack the third of Protoss if they have one which they probably should. 

MC actually went Collosus here to counter Hydra's but behind this attack Life started a Spire and forced MC to gg when the mutas were out. Something to keep in mind is that this build was pretty greedy and worked out because MC didn't do any gateway pressure. 

_________________________________________________
Life vs Flash Game 3 Ling/Bling All in

A crazy build by Life that really put the ""Swarm"" in Heart of the Swarm. He opts to get 2 macro hatches before the Lair to put on a huge amount of pressure with zerglings/banelings.

9 Overlord

15 Hatch -----&gt; Gas-------&gt; Spawning Pool

2x Queens

Zergling Speed

Takes all but 1 drone out of gas

3rd Hatch @ ~4:55

Zerglings as needed, otherwise drone

Queens for Creep spread and defense

2x Evolution Chamber/ Start adding more lings to your army

+1/+1 started

Baneling Nest

2x Macro Hatches  

Lair

Pump out tons of lings from 4 hatches you have

Morph tons of banelings. Life went up to 22 banes for the first attack w/ 78 lings as well

Huge attack by Life into the natural of Flash. Kills TONS of workers and army, not immediately killing Flash but as reinforcements continue to stream in Flash is eventually broken and GG's.

___________________________________________________

Life vs MC Game 3 Roach/Ling Timing Attack

This build completely caught MC off guard with a midgame Roach/Ling attack. I apologize for not having a lot of super new HOTS units builds.

9 Overlord

14 Spawning Pool

16 Hatch 

Pair of Lings/Queen

3rd @ ~3:50

Make sure to get queens at the natural and third and start droning for a bit

2x gas @ 5:45. (Slightly earlier than normal)

Starting pumping some lings and get speed started

Take all gas

Roach Warren

Lair

Life starts 13 or so roaches and a ton of lings for a big relatively early attack on MC which ends of killing him. As Life moved out he started a spire and finished off the crippled MC with Mutas. Life's huge economy along with a pretty nice early timing attack allows him to overrun MC.

________________________________________________________

Leenock vs Babyknight Game 1

Leenock showed some an awesome new strategy involving a super fast Lair and the use of swarm hosts and vipers to contain Babyknight on 2 bases

9 Overlord

15 Hatch

17 Pool

18 Gas

2x Queens

6 or so lings and start speed

Overlord Speed Research. This is on Hatch tech and we've seen a lot of Zergs in HOTS get this to improve scouting.

Take all Gas and start Lair (Leenock used the Hatch at the natural)

When Lair is done start a Hydra Den

Third Hatch

Start making Hydralisks for defense and eventually offense

Get some macro hatches and start making Swarm Hosts. Once you have a decent amount begin moving to the third and set them up. If your creep is spread far enough you can build a spine wall and use them to cover your Swarm Hosts. Keep adding on Swarm Hosts/Hydras/ and if he gets Collosus get some Vipers for the abduct ability. The cool thing about this Swarm Host siege is that the Locusts are free, so any damage you do with them is free and will always be not cost effective for the Protoss. 

Life starts Hive @ 13 minutes and begins to swich his comp to Ultralisk/Ling/Bling  with a few infestors due to his opponents lack of sentries and his choice of comp. I know I didn't put the timings for everything, but this is just a basic outline. Watch Leenock vs Babyknight Game 1 to really get it down. I am not a main Zerg player, so I might have worded some stuff weird, so feel free to call me out on anything I said that was inaccurate :D

Maybe this will be just your average ""Oh man, I don't progess as fast as I would like to"" post, maybe this one will go a little bit deeper.

I play Zerg now since early last year. I was a former platinum terran, but after hitting plat, I realized how boring Terran metagame was to me. So I decided to start out new. I bought a second account, to make sure, my decision was absolute. I tried a bit protoss (I initially started with playing protoss in ladder season one, because they were my favourite race in SC1), but most games lacked the excitement of fast engagements, because at that time almost all lower league protoss player turtled to death ball on 2 bases and so did I. Finally, my journey with the swarm began.

Soon, after getting used to the unique mechanics with larva/macro/army supply, I started to love the fastness of playing Z properly. Nothing excited me more then those damn fast speed lings on creep, creating army out of seemingly nothing, constant harrass with mutalisks and so on. Larva Inject was really fun to learn (I tried several methods over the year, finally came up with the base cam hotkey set to spacebar). I flipped my whole hotkey setup because finally, I felt that I could do better with rearranging my stuff, and I actually did.

I barely used direct build orders, I just relied on my knowledge of the certain matchup and timings, played straightly after the plan I made up during the loading screen, addapted quite nicely to what my enemy would do. And with the release of HotS I finally managed to get back to platinum and was able to defeat most of my opponents (beside most ZvZ's. I really started to hate that damn match up). 

I have two or three decent master level player in my friendlist, and of course I played them sometimes. All three said, that I was good enough to be at least diamond, maybe even low masters, if I practice more.

And here is my point, that I want to state with this whole nonsense post: I don't feel like I get better, I feel like I get worse. It frustrates me to the point, where I get absolute bm for no reason. I play 10-30 games a week with a regular, physical somewhat exhausting job, I have a girlfriend and an annoying (&lt;3) cat to take care of. I love SC2, I love the eSport-scene, I like to watch my favourite pros march to victory in major tournaments, I like to buy stuff to support eSports (I'm wearing one of the 3 TL-Shirts with the racial logo right at the moment), I love to watch the streams of players, love to discuss latest tournament games with my friends. 

And I DAMN want to improve my overall SC2-skill. 



TL;DR: Is anyone willing to go through a couple of my replays and point out mistakes, that I do regularly, not in a specific game, so I can work them out? I would really, really appriciate it. 

PS: I'll upload replays if anyone is actually interessted to help me out.

The numbers: (edit: this is time in seconds it takes for these buildings/upgrades, provided if you wanted to check my math. When you start your pool and evos depends on the map and the match up, but I find knowing the relative timings is useful (eg like knowing you start your spire with hive if you want to get fast greater spire))

Pool 65 

Lair 80

Infestation Pit 50

Hive 100

+1 160

+2 190

+3 220 (not relevant to calculation)

Doing some subtraction on these numbers gives us the relative timings:

First start +1, then you have 80 seconds to make a lair for +2 to start on time.  Once you start +2, you have 40 seconds to start your infestation pit so you can get hive in time for  +3

tl, dr: start lair halfway through +1, then start infestation pit 40s into +2

TangSC here from Team All-Inspiration, and I'm excited to announce the launch of our team's pay-what-you-can coaching platform!  For the past three years, I've coached and been coached in StarCraft II, witnessing from both sides the immense impact that coaching can have on a player's skill and motivation.  

I believe without reservation that everyone benefits from the attention and guidance of the right people, but not everyone has the funds to hire an experienced coach.  Most coaches charge over 20$USD an hour, which for some students is impossible.  Over the years, I've had quite a few people who couldn't afford coaching contact me and ask for help. I always answer their questions and push them towards a learning resource that I think would help them, but in terms of 1-on-1 coaching, I just didn't have the time to do it myself.  

A few months ago, I first had the idea of a community coaching project that does not set an hourly rate but instead relies on donations from students and viewers to compensate the coaches and spur project growth.  I contacted several coaches to gauge their interest, and found many were hesitant to get involved in a project that does not guarantee a set hourly rate.  This may sound selfish on the part of the coach, but it's understandable - coaching is a business and I was asking them to take a risk.  

Despite this minor set-back, we're going to fight tooth-and-nail to get this project under way, because we genuinely believe that we will provide a helpful service by promoting an effective and entertaining learning platform.  I'm so thrilled to have the support of Team All-Inspiration, and several team members have already expressed their enthusiasm about the project and offered their time and resources to help get started.  

I'd like to ask for your trust and support, ATZ, because without the support of the community we cannot reach the height of our potential.

It's an all in but if you do enough damage it's not that hard to recover. 
If the all in fails (which rarely happens), you have to get a lair immediately and drone. 

Basically, you get speed roaches, lings then banes and you attack at like 8. Where the terran is mostly defenseless against 14 banelings.

Build: 

15 hatch
16 pool
17 gas
17 overlord

get speed as soon as possible, 1 spine at 4:30, for hellions or reapers and 1 pair of lings.


24-25 ovie

drones drones drones 

36 roach warren 
36 2nd gas 

And now morph at least 4 ovie, wait for the roach warren to finish and make like 8 roaches (rally them to your opponents base)

52 baneling nest 
more ovies and only lings 

Once the lings gets to the roaches (in front of your opponents natural)
morph as many banelings as possible and focus the bunker

rally more lings and keep your injects going (really important)

You only need 2 queens.

Here is the link of the build:

http://www.sc2planner.com/?v=#ZaaajaaaaaaoAaaoFaaoDajchhkaaajuDaaoJaaaaaaaaaaoHjoDajjcjlllllllloLkkkkkkjttttkkkkttkkkkkkk

It is an easy build to do and it works so well. 
To counter it the terran must have scanned at 7 minutes. and made like 2 widowmines, marauders and 3 bunkers. Otherwise it is nearly impossible to hold.

 I stream daily, I lately have been busy so my viewer numbers have dropped. But, I want my stream to be a place where both young and experienced zergs can come to help each other out. I take questions from chat and answer them. I offer some free coaching when requested. I'm super interactive and I give you permission to slap me (Cyberslap) if I don't remember you from watching me earlier. I want it to be a super personal stream! So my general stream times are below. 

**Weekdays** 3:30pm-5:00pm (*hour break*) then resume again at 6:00pm - 10:pm. **EST**


**Weekends** Highly varies. Since I dedicate my life to the swarm, I am typically always home streaming. But it can range anywhere from 7AM-11PM :)  **EST**

**About me:** I am a recently Masters zerg. I struggled in diamond for 3 seasons. I know how it feels to be a lower league. It is super easy to quit but hard to keep going. I feel at a higher level, it becomes less and less fun for some. But if you love competition and pushing your abilities then this is the game to play. I always am looking for help and to give help to both better me as a coach, streamer and player as well as caster and to better others! The game is way more fun when you have a place to learn and constantly get good information. I hope I can be that place. 

TL;DR- I love ATZ, I want to help everyone by offering free coaching and a place to chat in my stream. Oh and I'm a masters zerg!

P.S. to everyone wondering wtf TL;DR means... it means Too long didn't read... like I had no idea what that meant for the longest time.  :P

So here's a little discussion on how i feel many people don't understand how to use this unit. Let's line up the important aspects.

- Strategic range, very important, the swarmhost outranges the tempest by a vast margin, the swarm host is by far unit with the highest potential range in the game.
- Can attack while being invisible, also quite important
- Very high dps, almost 30
- if the locusts are killed, the dps drops down extremely quickly.
- Attacks only ground

Consider the locust
- 14 dps, 65 hp. Compare this to the marine with stim which has 55 hp and 10.5 dps. If the marine is a glass cannon, the locust is even worse, it should become immediately apparent that the locust is not a tank by any means, it's a glass cannon. While locusts can tank damage because they are free, you want to keep them _alive_. Yes, they will die anyway after a timed life which is important to consider, but locusts are glass cannons.

Alright, that aside, we've established the swarmhost to have strategic range, let's just assume that it could be used 'in your main army' while having strategic range, that would mean it would be the single best unit ever in the game if it was good in close combat and could attack at strategic range it would be the most broken unit ever. It's like amoving tempests into an army and being surprised at how terrible they are. The swarmhost simply is terrible if it's range isn't used appropriately, and it should be. People try to use them as lurkers, they aren't lurkers, lurkers do not have this huge range and do way more damage.

As is any unit with a very high range, they are an inhaerently strategic unit that sucks just making them in your army if the enemy army can get in range.

Okay, so swarm hosts are a strategic unit that doesn't so much 'counter' a specific unit as much as it has a specific role. They are amazing in any situation where it is impractical to actually reach the swarmhost itself:

- They are great at breaking a choke, it's very hard for the enemy to traverse the choke where the locusts are to reach the swarmhosts opposed to the open. This was the original purpose fo the SH. In ZvT, if T was ahead, he could just walk into Z's natural with his larger army and end the game. Z had to be really ahead to be able to break a choke where T had a strong defensive position with tanks before brood lords. The swarm hosts provides a capability to do this while simulatenously setting up a hard contain.

- They are great at holding a choke, it's very hard to push into a choke point wtih swarm hosts on the other side via the same logic. In that sense on certain maps they become an answer to certain all ins, especially because detection tends to come at a prize in certain all ins.

- They are great against anything that can inhaerently not reach them, specifically static D. With brood lords being less viable in ZvP due to the tempest, a protoss player who masses cannons and turtles really hard would be very hard to break without swarm hosts. Cannons can't move out and actually hit the swarm hosts, same thing with spine crawlers, bunkers, and you name it.

- They are excellent at containing mech armies. Since swarmhosts vastly outrange siege tanks, it's not feasible to leapfrog tanks to advance out of it as you can against roaches.

__Why they are an inhaerently good unit for the spectatorship__

The swarm host is often compared to the Lurker, the Brood lord, and the Siege tank. I feel they are inhaerently better designed than any of those three.

- The thing with tanks is that they create a mexican standof, both have a tank line, both knows that whoever advances forward is at a disadvantage and will lose tanks so no one dares to. Swarm hosts do not create a mexican standof, they create a tug of war, the player with the higher swarmhost count will eventually break through. A swarmhost contain thereby puts more pressure upon the opponent and creates an eb and flow. Evidenced by Ryung vs MKP on Antiga, MKP contained Ryung but Ryung didn't even bother, he had his own tanks and just sat there denying MKP's attempts at expanding with drops, swarm hosts put pressure on your opponent and more than just containing actually creating a need to break out rather than to just sit there.

- Lurkers were often considered a zerg siege tank, but in the end, the analogy is much closer to a Zerg widow mine. They are an ambush unit that can also be used in your main army if carefully burrowed. While it's cool, it creates certain elements of luck involved as well as extremely short battles whereas swarmhosts create extremely _long_ battles in a tug of war where it won't be clear who wins them until the very end.

- THey are actually completely not like the BL. Yes, both spawm free units, but that's about it, the most important thing is that broodlings don't have to slowly walk to the enemy and thereby provide next to no tanking. Another thing is that BL's are in the same range class as colossi which is actually the most awful range class in the game, they have longe enough range that it makes them weak enough in a straight up fight that they need a tanking layer, thereby promoting deathballing, but their range is short enough that they can't actually be used strategically on their own. Siege tanks, and tempsts are the next range class and carriers can fall into either depending on if you use the leash. Seige tanks to some extend have long enough range to effectively be used strategically in such a way that the position really matters (and for some reason Zerg have whined for maps to be able to be designed that not a single strategical use of tanks can still take place). Swarm hosts are a whole different level and you often see people on the ladder not using this, it might come as a surprise but you actually want to position them such that they can just barely reach what they want to reach and as far away as possible from it. You often see people just thoughtlessly plant them in the general vicinity, far too close. You also want to place them around a corner if you can in general so that the locusts enter the from side and are able to tank for your army.

And with all this, I find use for swarmhosts in like 1/2 of my ZvP games, 2/5 of my ZvZ and 1/5 of my ZvT games. Because they are a strategic unit, specific situations need to arise for them to be useful. It depends on the map, the state of the game, and what your opponent is doing, but without swarmhosts. P could just turtle with tempests and cannons and and there would be no way ever for Z to break it.

while watching multiple lower- to mid-league streams I noticed that many players still don't use this technique to have all built units grouped in hotkeys at all times in the game. Sometimes 1/3 or even half of the army of those players weren't taking part in the battle but sitting in front of the natural.

So I just want to motivate all of you fellow locusts to add this to your play if you haven't already.

I've been lurking here for a while (oh god I miss lurkers) but had to say thanks. I'm still only silver league, but seeing as how I was stuck in bronze ALL through WoL, that in itself is a pretty big deal for me, especially since I've been climbing through silver at a good clip now too, and will hopefully not stay there for long.

That's not the point of this post, though.

The point of this post, is because last night, I had my first win that felt like a REAL win, if that makes any sense. It was vs. Protoss, which for me usually means ""about to get rolled over by mass void rays and colossi"" but, armed with all the knowledge I've gained from here and from LowkoTV, I gave it my best.

Guys, it was glorious. I made plenty of mistakes, I know that for sure, but I felt for the first time like *I* was in control. I had recently started working on being better about scouting, and using control groups instead of just F2, and stopped his initial attack before it ever reached my base.

After that, it was time to make sure he never got the void ray deathball I knew from scouting was coming. I broke in to his base with a swarm of lings/blings, and did some real damage to his economy, and then followed up with some constant pressure with my mutalisks. He ahd some void rays, but they just weren't enough... he tried to split them, and take out my base while holding off my attack, but I had been smart enough to not try an all-in, and once the mutas and spore crawlers/queens at my bases mopped up his feeble counter assault, they joined my main force at his base, and it was over.

The mighty Protoss I had feared for so long was fallen.

I had won before, but usually when my opponent made obvious fatal mistakes. This was, without a doubt, the first victory I truly felt I had earned, and it feels fantastic.

So, I wanted to just say thanks to the fantastic folks at ATZ who helped me improve my game, and an equally huge thanks to Lowko, who's videos and streams not only entertained, but educated.

I hope I did this correctly, I wanted it to be a self.post without karma.

Anyway, I've caught the HotS tournament fever, and I really want to personally sponsor an online event for Platinum/Diamond players to have a piece of the action too. 

* Entry is free.

* Placement is first-come, first-served. 

* Comment or PM me ASAP with any interest to ensure your place in the competition. Please include your tag, rank, ladder data (W/L record, total points) and preferred race.

* Minimum = 16 players, Max = 32.

* Minimum = Platinum rank, Max = Diamond.

* There will be group play similar to GSL formatting- 4 groups for 16 players, 8 groups for 32 players.

* Seeding will be determined by rank and ladder points.

* Scheduling will be determined on a group-by-group basis, thus the magnitude needs to be smaller. Matches will most-likely take place on weekends or weeknights, depending on the time zones of players.

* 1st place will take home 50$, and 2nd place will take home 20$ (via PayPal).


I am assuming full responsibility for correspondence and scheduling, so please leave a comment or PM me if you are interested. 

Please keep in mind that I work full-time, and am organizing/sponsoring this out of pocket.

**Introduction**
My name is Mavvie, and I'm a mid-masters Zerg in NA. I don't ladder much at all, I mainly play in tournaments and practice games, so I personally feel that my points don't reflect my skill very accurately, just because of how small the sample size is. ZvZ is actually my worst matchup, but I always feel confident while playing it. It's definitely the hardest Zerg matchup, at least because there aren't any guides on it yet! I know that Ostojiy and Belial are working on ZvZ guides, and I have no doubt that they will both greatly outshine mine, but I figured I'll just provide my view and insight on the matchup :)

**Early Game**


Oh boy, where to start with the early game? These are the standard openers:

* Cheesy pool first (6-9 pool)
	I'm not going to talk about these at all, as there's already multiple guides on the topic and it should be common knowledge. A simple search for ""6 pool"" should provide you with all the information you need on this.

* 10 pool
	This is an interesting build. It is a build order win against hatch first and early pools, but is significantly behind against every other build. Just match his ling count (scouting overlords!), take a fast gas if you haven't already, and expand ~16-17 after your queen + gas. You have a bigger economy and better production, so even if he expands when you do, don't fret! Try to check his gas timing; if yours is really far ahead then you can go for a speedling/bane bust. If it's about even then get defensive banelings and play standard (You ARE ahead in the drone count, so don't worry). His gas shouldn't be faster than yours, but if it somehow is then just play defensively. Get fast banelings, defend and saturate 2 bases. I recommend a double evo roach/infestor style off 2 bases, but it's not necessary. If he does a 10 pool drone all in (which you can EASILY see the lings leave his base), then get a spine of your own and produce queen + lings. Don't get gas, drone micro properly, and you should be fine. Your lings will be out before he'll be engaging, so it'll be something like 16 drones + 4 lings (you) against 8 lings and ~10 drones (-1 per spine he makes). Delay as much as you can, just don't stop making lings. 1 queen and you can poke at his lings, remember that every second he doesn't attack you get further and further ahead! (he isn't even mining). I've never lost to a 10p drone all-in unless I went hatch first. Reactive lings and 1 queen hold this easily. You can probably keep your natural hatch alive too (cancel if it gets low, but if he's attacking it then he's retarded and you can accept your free win).

* Pool-hatch-gas opener (15-&gt;16-&gt;17 usually)
Standard macro build. 15 pool, 16 hatch, 17 gas (after overlord and queen) is my favourite variation, but there's many, many others. It gets late gas, so watch out for a 14/14 ling bane all-in. These can be defended by either a) Getting a baneling nest before speed, or b) Getting 3/4 queens and/or a second spine at your natural to defend. Wall off your ramp, simcity to save your spines, etc. There really isn't much to this build. Your first 2 lings can go scout/pressure a little, but only make the 1st pair unless your opponnent is making lings. You should be able to safely enter the midgame with this bulid, every game.

* Hatch first opener (hatch-gas-pool, hatch-pool-gas, etc)
Simple build. The gas before pool openers are safer, but you can only afford 1 queen and speed when the pool finishes. If you get gas after pool + hatch, it's the same as the pool-hatch-gas opener (Read it for defense against 14/14 ling/bane all ins). Don't get supply blocked, stay safe. First 100 gas goes to ling speed, then pull 1 drone off gas until 50 gas where you get a baneling nest (~25-28 supply). With that timing you should be safe. Scout and react, you should be fine against everything.

General tips on defending all-ins:

* *Always* get a spine at 5:00, and *never* skip the baneling nest (or delay it past 27). You need these two buildings to survive any sort of mass ling or ling/bane all in.

* Don't be greedy. When your bane nest finishes, morph 3-4 banelings at home. Spread them out. Be careful.

* Poke his natural at 5:15-5:30. This can be with lings or an overlord, anything goes.  You need to see his natural drone count at 5:30 at the latest. If you see little/no drones, mass lings and save gas for banelings. If he's about as saturated as you then feel free to only morph 2 banelings to get a faster lair/third/upgrades (whatever your midgame plan is, more on this later).

* Simcity is a good unit. Pros like to create some form of simcity that creates chokes. You can use baneling nests, evo chambers, etc as more than just a tech structure. You know that spine you build around 5:00-5:30? That should be surrounded on 2 sides by a hatch + bane nest

* When worst comes to worst, evacuate the natural and block the ramp. Banelings can't bust up 2 queens, and if you have transfuse then it'll take him a long time (hint: long enough for you to morph defensive banelings!)

* There's no reason not to see any and every unit that leaves his base; use overlords to their full potential!


Specific all-ins:

**14/14 Ling/bane all-in:**

Super easy to scout (no expand, lots of lings). Just defend with spine/queen/ling, defensive banelings at natural ramp. If you open with a fast gas then get ling speed -&gt; bane nest, otherwise go bane nest first and don't hesitate to make a few extra queens. This is extremely common in the lower leagues, but you should never lose. Play honestly, get a bane nest and spine in time, produce lings after getting a small drone lead, and you should be fine. Defenders advantage is awesome.


**1 base roach all-in**

A terrible build. Get a few spines shortly before he moves out, and mass lings. He's so all in that it's okay to stop at ~17 drones. Try to get fast gas for speed; you can then counterattack like it's your job (it is). If he delays his attack then get ~20 speedlings and attack his main when he reaches midmap. You're guaranteed every drone, then just come back to your spines (make 1-2 per minute that he stays on 1 base to be safe).

Just to elaborate a bit: If he's doing a 1 base roach expand, get 2 spines quickly, then pure drones. If he moves out then make 3 more spines and mass lings. It can be hard to identify between a roach expand and a roach all-in, but roaches are so slow that it doesn't matter. As long as you have 2/3 spines, reactive speedlings + spines will hold ezpz. 


**""2 base"" roach/ling all-in**

A bit more powerful, it's been referred to as the ""4gate"" of ZvZ. It kills you if you teched too hard or droned too hard. It's easy to scout (roaches, almost no drones at natural). It's typically done of 2 gasses, usually has no upgrades. Defend with spine/ling/bane at your natural, and try to start lair before he moves out. The tech advantage you have is huge, along with the drone lead. Stop at like, 34 drones at most and then mass units.

You can also go roaches yourself; if you do this you can actually get more drones out, just with later lair/upgrades. Don't forget banelings to eliminate his lings!


I think that's pretty much all the early game all ins in ZvZ, if I've missed some let me know and I'll add them in!

TL;DR

* Get an honestly timed bane nest + spine

* Try to saturate your natural; that's your goal in the early game

* Use overlords to scout his natural drone count and to see if he moves out

1351813651.0,21,self.allthingszerg,12hika,TSLHyuN's safe roach+fast third build (ZvT),Xutar,23,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/12hika/tslhyuns_safe_roachfast_third_build_zvt/,"I transcribed this build from HyuN's games against LG-IMYoda from this morning's code S ro32 group. (Here are the links to the games he used it in:  [game2](http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls5/vod/70991/?set=8), [game3](http://www.gomtv.net/2012gsls5/vod/70991/?set=9)). I believe this is a very solid and safe  macro build for anyone to use on the ladder. Possible disadvantages are not many creep tumors (you only get two with the build order) and it's not quite as cutting edge economic as possible.  

So without further ado, here's the build order:  

9OL, 15Hatch, 16 Pool  (drone scout depending on the map)  
17 gas, 17 OL, starting with 18th drone rally both hatches to natural  
@pool finish, 2 queens + 2 lings  
26 OL, speed shortly after (pull two drones out)  
30 OL, then @larva pop, drone to 42/44  (rally two of these drones in your main back into the gas geyser)

42/44 In this order, get: OL, 3rd base, roach warren@nat, 3rd queen@nat  
note: third queen lays two tumors, then goes to third to inject  

next: take 2nd gas@nat as you drone to 49/52  
49/52 6 lings, 52/52 3OL  
52/76 make 8 roaches, then 2 evos@nat  
66/78 rally all hatches to third and drone to 78  
78/78 2OL, then start +1melee and +1carapace  
drone to 90/94, (slightly over 60 drones total)  
90/94 2OL, Lair, macro hatch, 4th base, 2 gas@ third, and rally each base back to its own mineral line  

From here the build opens up to your choice of tech and unit composition.  

 In game two against Yoda, HyuN pumps tons of lings and roaches to hold off Yoda's two base timing. Then he keeps a relatively low gas income and only uses his lair tech for roach speed and 2-2 at first.
  
 In game three, he scouts the fast third CC, so he takes all 6 gases quicker and techs more quickly to infestors. Obviously, you should make these variations in reaction to what the Terran is doing, such as making spores if he's going for banshees.  

Hopefully some of you find this build useful, glhf!

If you have ANY questions or comments please post them in this thread. I can explain the build in further detail if you ask.

1365795337.0,19,self.allthingszerg,1c84zp,Sharing my anti-muta ZvZ with you guys. Easy defense against all ins... Works in HotS and WoL!,marshall19,27,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1c84zp/sharing_my_antimuta_zvz_with_you_guys_easy/,"I've have a massively positive win rate in ZvZ in HotS and I thought I would share my build with you guys. At the end of WoL I was learning a new ZvZ opener and in beta I adapted it to make for a perfect anti-muta timing. And given that 95% of use are slaves to the extremely one dimensional ZvZ metagame and always go mutas, I have been picking up so many wins from zerg players. The benefits of this build(when played correctly
) are: 1. Any ling/baneling all ins beyond early pools fail. 2. It is extremely effective against players going mutas on lair tech. 3. I have used this successfully on several current WoL grandmasters zerg players... aka it works in both games, but better vs HotS's metagame.


Here is the build: First do a gasless expand. 15 hatch, 16 pool(Not sure if a 15 pool/16 hatch method could be viable if you aren't confortable with early pool timings) Anyway, as soon as your pool is finished make two queens and a spine(if the ramp is not close to the natural, you might need to make 2 spine if you suspect agro play) block the ramp with the queens(hold position) when you are not injecting although you should know when lings are coming at you if you competently placed your overlords. Make your 3rd and 4th queens as soon as the first set is done. You are droning all the way up to 36 supply. Once at 36, take a gas in your nat and a gas in your main. Throw down a roachW followed by an evoC.(make these buildings as part of a wall to the ramp along with the spine(s). With the first 100 gas make a lair, with the next 100 get +1 ranged attack. Continue with queen production out of the non-laired hatch. If you see lings moving out at this section of the game, feel free to cancel +1 or even the lair(if you don't have the gas) to get 2-5 roaches out. If the lings/banes come, run your natural drones by mineral walking through the ramp queens.

Take your 3rd and 4th gasses maybe a minute after your first gasses. Try to drone up to max saturation (16 on minerals, 6 on gas for each base) Once fully saturated make your first batch of roaches and a nydus network.(watch out for overseers - you have the queen count to deny scouting) depending on your gas/mineral count favor more queens or roaches. Once the nydus finishes, place it anywhere you know it won't be scouted. (I prefer to put it right outside their freshly planeted 3rd base... but you should be massing OLs outside their base so you have lots of options) send your 5-7 queens with your 12-20 roaches through the worm. Spire would have just finished, so they will likely have 5-8 mutas. Regardless of what they have, you have to be all over the transfuses, if they have mass roach(like in WoL) you need the transfuses + extra queen DPS or you are screwed. If they have mutas you need to transfuse before they can focus down any queens. Anyway, aside from transfuse, you are just slow pushing with an unbreakable force. Keep making roaches and sending them through the worm. Sometime, the build can be slightly late or you messed up the tranfuses or some other mistakes were made. If your first attack failed it is likely you did at least some economic damage to their nat. Follow up by getting a hydra den and +2 and time a new worm to finish with the upgrade.

Simplified:

15 hatch

16 pool

+2 queens

+2 queens

36 gas

35 gas

34 RoachW

33 EvoC

first 100 gas - Lair

second 100 gas - +1 range

+ 2 gas

Fully saturate and continue queen production at available hatcheries.
Nydus with roaches and queens outside their base.

**(WARNING EXTENSIVE READ)**


Firstly I’d like to talk a little bit about what you need as a person, in order to push yourself out of your comfort zone and progress through the leagues. Some people achieve this naturally, while others have a more difficult time; and in this section I hope to cover exactly that.

You have to ask yourself; why do you play? Really, ask yourself. Do you play for fun? Do you play to improve? Do you play for social reasons? If you wish to progress as fast as possible through the leagues then the number one focus here should be to improve. This is by far at the core of every player who has risen from a low league and into masters+. Watching LiquidTLO’s stream you can see that Dario does not ladder to win, he plays ladder to improve on certain aspects of his game, so that he can bring them to tournaments and compete at a higher intensity - the professional scene drives this mentality home constantly.

Once you’ve agreed to focus on improving rather than having fun, social etc.. You’ve made the first step to heading up the ladder leagues. I’d just like to point out that you don’t have to force yourself to not find StarCraft II fun anymore; it’s just that fun should be a secondary and involuntary focus. 

Your next step is about how to approach games, and losses. We’ve all experienced those intensely frustrating games that when you ‘gg’ and leave, you just want to rip your hair out and give up. Beating this on a constant basis is what really opens up the door to fast improvement. At the core of this emotion is your ego. If you have a big ego you will feel these emotions far stronger than someone who takes it much more lightly – but how can we merge being serious about improving, and also not become affected so much by losses? Simple; 

**Winning is not the aim and never should be – the aim should always be to improve.**

You really have to believe that, not just repeat it in your head and agree with it. When you start up a ladder session take a minute or two to decide on which part of your play you will focus on, and make that your main priority when laddering. If you’re so uncomfortable using a particular build then you should probably play more games verse the AI until you’re at a level where you feel comfortable focusing on specific areas, rather than the grand scheme.

**Believe in yourself.**

You have to believe in yourself in order to fast track up the leagues. Everyone can get themselves into gold at the least, and once you’re at that level of play you should be able to identify which parts of your macro and game plan are causing your losses. Honestly, the biggest surge of improvement comes when you reach gold level play. If you don’t believe that you can, then you won’t – this is also true for ‘real life’, as with most things related to improving in SCII. So, you’re having trouble believing you can get past your league wall – Once you’ve read through this, and you’ve put a little bit of effort into learning the strategies listed and general game plans, you’ll feel much better about yourself. I had a similar thing at platinum level, and when Scrible helped me out with a game plan verse toss I felt so much more confident entering the games, which was an amazing feeling.

“Self-talk” can be a very useful tool in order to gain confidence. You can simply tell yourself over and over that you’re going to win ( a lot of professional sporting players do this ). Another great way of boosting your confidence with self-talk is to repeat your timings to yourself as you click “Find Match”. I.e. “I will get my gas at six minutes, my warren, evo and lair at seven minutes and be fully saturated by eight minutes thirty seconds”.

**Set yourself a season-long goal, and multiple short term goals in order to achieve the seasonal goal.**

My seasonal goal was to go from Bronze to Masters in a maximum of 8 weeks – alas, I only achieved Bronze – diamond, but I am still very happy about this. I started out by setting myself ‘session’ goals; i.e. ‘the games I play tonight I will try and do X, Y and Z”. Applying these small ‘session goals’ you’ll start to see an improvement – your win;loss ratio may go down, but your overall skill will improve.

I’ll take an insert of my diary I kept on my local forum. This was the first entry I made, and albeit it was completely impossible to do, looking back on it – it was exactly what I needed to fast boost my learning pace. 

&gt;“Day 1: Macro.
&gt;
&gt;I've decided to master the most basic thing a SCII player can; macro. The key word being 'master'. A lot of players(including a younger self) will accept ""learn"" as a good enough degree. 
&gt;
&gt;Goals: Never miss a larvae drop from 0:00 - 11:30.
&gt;At 5:00 to have 3 base and 3 queen.
&gt;Ready to attack at 11:30 
&gt;Be around 60-65 drones at 11:00
&gt;
&gt;The build I'm using is Stephano's Zerg Max
&gt;
&gt;Result: 
&gt;At 5:00 to have 3 base and 3 queen.
&gt;Ready to attack at 11:30
&gt;Be around 60-65 drones at 11:00
&gt;
&gt;Not very successful with getting 3 queen by 5 minutes(hatch is fine). Larve macro improved. Build order not memorised well enough to not have to concentrate on it. Found attacking at a specific time rather difficult, especially if i was down on my macro.. lesson learned is, without good macro, you can't even begin to expect to do mid-late pushes on a designated time. Supply blocked a couple times, trying to figure out when is a good time to spam overlords. My focus was this, and also to basically just crush the opponent using pure macro-large-force-armies, rather than timed pushes. Most of the work is sloppy, but we'll get there.”

By doing this I could clearly identify and quantify what I had to work on, rather than thinking to myself and then potentially forgetting some details hours/days later.

**Force yourself to play more games.**

Being out of your comfort zone is the soil in which you grow stronger.

A little algorithm I came up with for how many games you should try to play goes like this; n*1.3 = x
(games you usually play) x (1.3) = Games you should be playing (round the number up or down accordingly).

Now, this does have rounding up and rounding down, so If you're unsure about rounding up; 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 all get rounded 'down' to make 0.0 , and 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 all get rounded 'up' to make 1.0 - this also means that 1.1 becomes 1.0 and 4.5 becomes 5.0.


E.g. If I currently play 2 games and become tired.

2 * 1.3 = 2.6
= 3.0
we then round 2.6 up to 3.0 and thus, we should now play 3 games in a row next time.

Furthermore; if we play 5 games in a row; 
5 * 1.3 = 6.5 
rounded up makes 7. We now play 7 games in a row next time.

This even works if you can hit out 20 games in a row. 20 * 1.3 = 26. Notice how the jump isn't massive? 'Exponentially' your games played should increase, and thus your growth will increase also. If you don't have the time to play 10+ games a row that is fine. If you're casually playing the game, being able to hit out 10 games in a row is really quite enough.

**Dealing with Cheese.**

If you come across someone who plays with cheese try your best to defend it. If you manage to defend it, great, if you don’t- it doesn’t matter; your focus isn’t to learn cheese defence, it’s to improve your macro – cheese defence starts happening at diamond/low masters. Again, the loss does not matter, what you improved on was your familiarity with the cheese and how well/bad you returned to your game plan afterwards.

Upon returning to game plans after successful defending of cheese;
I recommend trying to stick to the timings regardless, even if your worker count is lower than normal. Secondly, if it’s 5:30 and you haven’t got your third down, and the cheese has recently been defended, just throw down your hatchery asap – things like that. This should start to develop your own game sense and as you progress through the leagues you’ll start to learn how to adjust accordingly.

**Setting up your SCII.**

Firstly, you’ll need to go into options and check the box to save every replay. Secondly you’ll need to re-bind the hotkey for “main base camera” from backspace, and change it to spacebar.

Control group 1 should be used for your main army/melee units

Control group 2 should be used for banelings/ranged/infestors when on brood/infestor/corruptor.

Control group 3 should be used for special units; infestors/mutas/broodlords

Control group 4 should be all of your hatcheries (depending on your inject method)

Control group 5 should be your queen(s) all queens on this if you ‘backspace’ inject.

Control group 6 should be your second queen if you don’t do the backspace inject method.

Control group 7 queen

Control group 8 queen

Control group 9 Spire(s)

Control group 0 Evo chambers or any other important upgrading buildings.

**Let’s gloss over what we’ve read.**

* Your main focus in SCII should be to improve.
* Having the correct mentality when dealing with loss and laddering.
* Winning should never be the aim; improving should be.
* Believe in yourself that you can indeed rise up leagues.
* Set yourself a seasonal goal and also ‘session’ goals each night, to achieve the seasonal goal.
* Think about keeping a record or diary of your thoughts/analysis about your SCII play.

Now that we’ve identified what we need to become in order to improve rapidly, we should start looking at the fundamentals of play style.

Macro will be your complete focus until you have achieved diamond league.

All-ins are tempting but they won’t force you to improve. When you are in leagues lower than diamond you have the luxury of winning purely on macro and a little game sense/mechanics. Once you’ve leagued up into diamond and masters, you have to combine a lot more parts of StarCraft II in order to net wins. Now, I’m not ignorant enough to say the commonly misused “just macro, a click, you’ll win” when you’re in gold or platinum league; because anyone who is saying that is just completely out of touch with the lower leagues. In ZvP late game at gold level you still need to position your broods correctly otherwise you’ll lose to an archon toilet.

***From Bronze league to achieving (low)Gold league, your main focus is to just macro and a-click. The reason behind a-clicking is because even though you may lose some games to lack of micro, you’re training relevant and more fundamental skills; macro/economy management/initial army engagement. You may be tempted to micro your units and make the most of what you’ve got on the field. Try that out, and then in the replay watch your macro fall completely. Remember, you goal isn’t to win, but to improve your macro and economy management.***

The days where stepping on creep meant certain death of Terran; where [banelings, lings, mutas, and infestors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uscwz6eY9Wo#t=15m23s) or [any other ungodly assortment of death](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMSv9_f8rh8#t=1m01s) spewed from each crack and crevice of the map. Tired of watching your units disappear around the map to invisible death traps? 


Ever think to yourself, **""Where have all the tanks gone?""**


Then this season is for you! Remind the Terrans you love about the beauty of the Siege Tank. Be part of the movement to bring back those gracious death cannons. Force your Terran partners to participate in ~~your selfish nostalgia~~ the good old days, or face obliteration.

Last night in the WCS Qualifiers Nestea was using a very aggressive build that I thought was unique. I'm not sure if he was doing this because he knew he was considerably better than his opponent or if it's a standard build of his. He does an early roach/speed ling push and follows it up with really quick 2 base mutas.

Personally, I've been doing between 15-20 games a week for 3 weeks now, and I'm in mid/high gold.  It's funny though, because if I don't play for several days, I feel like it takes me a few games just to get back in the swing of things.

In particular, I feel like I have the knowledge to be better, but I simply haven't put in the _hours_ to automatically remember to make my next move.  For example, back a year ago when I was playing WoL I would always get my hive tech out way too late, and I still make mistakes like this unless I've been playing a _lot_.  Then real life gets in the way and I end up not playing for a few days and I slide back a half a step again.  

So how about you guys?  How much do you play and what is your league?  Do you find you require a few games to brush off the dust after not playing for a few days?

**TLDR:**  15-20 games a week, mid/high gold.

Here's some guidance in each matchup,clever_us,25,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/16cp4q/hots_looking_for_direction_in_your_hots_beta_play/,"I've seen a lot of threads that express frustration with not having a basic idea of how to play in the HoTS beta, a number of comments suggesting that everything is just so imbalanced right now that there's no point playing, and just generally a good deal of conflicting advice as to what you should actually be doing in every matchup in the beta. Now while there are a number of things about the game which are silly or imbalanced in their current form, there are few things that will prevent you from winning games against people of similar skill level if you know what you're doing.

I am a mid-Masters Zerg in WoL and have played around 75 games of HoTS, but a lot of this insight isn't from me, but rather taken from Blade's excellent stream and posts on the Team Liquid HoTS strategy forum. Here's a link to his stream: http://www.teamliquid.net/video/streams/blade55555

Side note: I think Blade understands the beta better than anybody else, and I highly recommend his stream if you're looking to see some GM-level HoTS play with purpose and commentary.


**ZvT**


The basic idea here is pretty simple. If they go mech, you are in a very advantageous position, because roach/hydra/viper will roll it. If they go for a composition with bio in it, things get a bit more complicated, but you can generally go ling/bling/muta into ultras. You should be getting some infestors with this as well, and I imagine you could still substitute infestors for mutas. Should note that you're probably not intending to kill them with the mutas if you choose that route, but rather just trying to use them as a stepping stone to reach ultralisk tech. Ultralisks are excellent, especially in conjunction with blinding cloud and/or fungal.

A lot of people say that widow mines make mutas useless, but I haven't found that to be true. Mutas are good for dealing with drops, making it tough for them to take additional bases, and forcing them to produce defenses to deal with your mutas. That being said, widow mines are extremely annoying, and if they start to amass any reasonable number of them, you obviously don't want to be going muta from there.

What you open with is kind of irrelevant. I've been doing a roach opening every game but that was partly because of the old reapers, which could see up cliffs and melt your zerglings. With those gone maybe it's okay to open w/o roaches? Hellion openings are almost a given at this point so keep that in mind. Just figure out whether he is going mech or bio so that you can tech accordingly.

&gt;If at any point you are unsure what you should be doing, check if you have 3 full bases. Once you have three full bases you are basically trying to get to hive tech and a fourth as fast as possible while building plenty of units to defend yourself with.

Things that are particularly annoying or scary in HoTS ZvT, in my experience:
- A lot of widow mines: you have no choice but to get Hydras, because they're the only thing that can outrange them. Dealing with large quantities of widow mines is very difficult, since you can very easily get your overseers sniped. Once you have ultralisk tech or hypothetically brood lords you can deal with these easier, especially if you are ahead macro-wise. I've had success just barreling through widow mine fields with ultras because they're pretty beefy and don't care about splash
- Battlecruiser transition - I think Zerg anti-air in general is pretty weak, and will need addressing at some point in the beta. The armor upgrades carrying over from mech work out pretty well when it comes to producing a bunch of battlecruisers. I don't know how the recent changes to Ravens will pan out but they might make sky terran a bit scarier. One of the best ways to avoid losing to a sky terran transition is to scout well and know when he is trying to do it. Oftentimes in such a situation you will simply be able to kill him before he gets enough stuff together. If he does get it up then you're best off making a lot of corruptors and infestors and basically trying to replicate the Zerg defense against sky terran in WoL

Neither of these are a problem if your macro is better than your opponent's. I can't emphasize enough that the most important thing to improve is your macro. That is to say, widow mines or no widow mines, you're still going to win the games where you make more stuff than he does, most of the time.

Swarm hosts: these are an awkward unit. They don't really fit into any particular unit composition, they only work if you have a lot of them, and they are easy to maneuver around in most situations. I would not build them unless you have a specific all-in in mind or are way ahead and trying to break his defenses or something, but at that point you might as well use brood lords, which kind of illustrates the problem with the unit.


**ZvP**


At first I thought the mothership core was going to break the matchup but I was completely wrong. It actually doesn't seem to have much of an effect, at least in my experience. There's some silliness going on in this matchup right now as it settles down (ridiculously greedy thirds, ridiculously greedy gateway expands, etc) but in general it's pretty easy to pick a simple game plan and win a lot of games.

&gt;You can beat just about any midgame protoss army composition with roach/speed hydra and good upgrades. This includes the immortal/sentry all in (in my experience, and based on what I've heard from streamers) and also armies with small numbers of colossi or templar. later on if they go for a traditional deathball army you will need vipers (more colossi = more vipers), but most protoss players will opt to shoot for a sky toss + templar composition.

This air toss composition is very difficult to deal with and will no doubt be changed at some point in the near future. Corruptors get shredded by the new void ray, so there is practically no reason to build them at all, but hydras are simply too fragile to take on carriers and templar. The infestor may be the key, but I hate that unit, and so does Blade, so as a result I haven't tried it out or seen it used very much. Infestors have the obvious problem of dying reaaaaaaal hard to feedback, but they're probably the best bet, perhaps in conjunction with hydras or corruptors or something.

Vipers can be useful for pulling carriers and tempests and maybe colossi if they have those into your army of hydras, but they can't blinding cloud air units and they still die to feedback. Your best bet if you discover that your opponent is going for sky toss is to macro really well and attack him over and over while expanding to prevent him from attaining a critical mass of units or bases.

**The important thing to remember is that ZvP in HoTS is not a matchup in which your fortunes are likely to improve over time.** Rather, things are destined to get worse and worse for you as time goes on, so it is important to use your units while they are still useful. I've been contesting protoss players for their thirds with roach hydra pretty much every game, with a strategy kind of like this:

* quick gasless 3 hatch
* 2 gas geysers at 6 minutes
* roach warren and speed and evo
* lair with the second 100 gas you mine
* take 2 additional geysers
* figure out what he's doing with overlords
* hydra den asap; range first, then speed
* make roaches and hydras until either he 1) all ins you or 2) expands
* if he expands you attack, from multiple angles if possible, baiting force fields and backing off to let them drop
* if he all ins you make nothing but units and crush it

Often protoss players will opt for a stargate opening. If you hold it well, with just enough spores and queens and hydras as they begin to pop out, you will often be able to exploit a timing where most of their army value is in air units that die to hydras. Then you can attack across the map with hydras, rally roaches behind, and cancel or delay their third while taking your fourth, and get a lead together that you can lean on throughout the rest of the game.

spores are really easy to get, so it makes sense to at least build one at your front every game fairly early on. No reason not to, and it will save you a lot of headache against silly DT builds.

Another thing: if you scout and are positive he is not going stargate, you have the possibility to make a ton of mutas and surprise him and potentially get a game-winning advantage right then and there. The new mutas are excellent against a protoss player without phoenixes, and few opponents will get phoenixes reactively, because it's just too hard to catch up from that point

That being said if you go muta and he does some kind of 2 base gateway unit all in you can be in trouble. After dying this way once or twice due to lazy scouting or w/e I've pretty much stuck to roach/hydra


**ZvZ**


ZvZ is very simple! Go mutas every game. You basically can't go wrong with this in my experience. The strategy works something like this:

* 15 pool, 15 hatch, 15 gas or something similar
* build two pairs of lings, send one to his base to look at his gas and potentially tech structures, keep the other pair at home for rudimentary defense and to deny his scouting if possible
* Based on his gas timing, keep either 1 or 2 guys in gas past zergling speed and get a baneling nest defensively
* get either 3 pairs of additional lings if you want to play passive or a whole bunch if you want to play aggressive
* either way you want 2 banes at home on the top of your ramp to defend
* figure out if he is doing something like a roach/bane all in. He's probably not
* you should be droning throughout this process, but once your 6 lings + 2 banes + potentially spine + evo are up, you should drone like crazy and take all your gases and tech straight to lair
* when you hit lair you should have about 2 full bases with 4 gas geysers running strong. drop a spire immediately
* then take your third. Make a whole bunch of speedlings at this point to protect your third and potentially deny his if possible
NOTE: OVERLORD POSITIONING IS EXTREMELY KEY IN ZvZ. Generally speaking: your first overlord should end up behind his natural's mineral line to see if he is speedling all-inning you. Your second overlord should go in front of his natural to see his units as they come out. Your third overlord should go sit at his third to keep an eye on it. If you don't do this last step, you will lose a whole bunch of stupid games to people who take their third secretly at a ridiculously early time. The fourth overlord goes in front of your natural to keep an eye out for morphing banelings and the like — there's no need to rush it

Note that the above is actually exactly what you do in WoL to get mutas up as well. We're not coming up with anything groundbreaking here.

Once you have your first round of mutas out, storm across the map and figure out what he's doing. Is he turtling up with spores? Kill his third with muta/ling, sniping his banelings before they can hit your lings. Is he making mutas? Prioritize starting your +1 carapace for flyers upgrade and pour all your gas into more mutas. Either way you should have your 2 gas geysers at your third up and running as fast as humanly possible, preferably ready to go the instant the hatchery finishes.

ASSUMING HE WENT MUTA AS WELL:

From here you're just trying to macro as well as possible until you get an advantage by catching him when he has less mutas than you do or securing a fourth before he does. Once you have a sufficiently large advantage, you should either be able to kill him outright with the mutas and your ling/bling army or transition to ultra tech and win.

Ultralisks are the holy grail of the ZvZ lategame. There is basically nothing that beats them, or that is a better investment of your money. The only reason you don't go straight for them every game is that you have to have an advantage in mutas to do it. But once you have 9 3/5 ultras on the field and you're sitting on one more base than he is, there's very little he can do.

ASSUMING HE DID NOT GO MUTA, BUT WENT INFESTOR OR ROACH/HYDRA:

If he does this and manages to hold his third, as in you are not able to delay it at all or cancel it, or he is able to kill your third at the same time, you are in trouble. But neither of those situations should happen unless you mess up. If you have played your cards right, he should not have the resources both to take a third at the same time you do AND produce enough roach/hydra or infestors to hold off your muta/ling. That means his third is more than likely going to be later than yours.

At this point you want to make enough mutas to be intimidating, but start going for that ultra tech as soon as possible. He might be able to get a strong roach/hydra timing together, but if it only shows up at your base when you have ultralisks, you're going to win that fight. If he goes straight hydra, he might be able to produce enough to kill your mutas before you hit ultra tech, but ling/bane will work wonders against his army composition anyway. 

There are a number of reasons that mutas are so strong in the HoTS ZvZ metagame:
* obvious buffs to mutas in terms of speed and health regen make them more formidable and slow down your enemy's attempt to amass a counter-push strong enough to deal with them
* infestor nerfs have made it even less cost-efficient to deal with mutas unless you have a TON of infestors (range increase notwithstanding)
* ultras are an excellent transition that do not care about any of the things that kill mutas. They will chomp through hydras and rofl across fields of fungal growth

Tadaaa. The only annoying part is that if you get behind in the muta race you're in kind of a bind. You kind of have to fight your way back into the game with zergling/baneling counters and turtling behind spores and queens, but it's super tough. Once again, though, this comes down to macro, and the player with the better macro is the one who is going to win in HoTS ZvZ as it stands.

Don't be afraid to make a bunch of spines if you're floating minerals. This goes for pretty much every matchup, actually. It's rarely possible to make too many spines, as long as you replace the workers afterwards.

Its been becoming more and more apparent in my group of friends that I am currently the best Zerg, and I'm also currently the only Master Zerg. This means I'm lacking in someone to ask for advice from, or to play solid ZvZ's against. The other Master/Diamond Terran/Protoss players are also finding that they're lacking some variety in who they play against, as my styles are only so diverse.

---

Let me say a bit more about myself and the group. We're a group of friends from across the world with a full mix of leagues/races/ages/genders who meet up on the **EU server**. We aim to improve and have fun, whilst reporting any internal games to our internal ladder, and are usually hanging out on our Teamspeak server. If no one wants to ladder or have specific practice, we usually observe games between each other and give general advice and chat. Though sometimes we break out into teamgames or arcade, depends how we want to blow off steam! We've played in a few internal and external clan wars/tournaments, and we look to continue these internal tournaments (and external, if our higher ranked players are confident).

I'm a Masters Zerg from the UK. I don't know whether I'm low, mid or high as I don't care for that, but I know I've beaten 5-6 GMs with names I didn't recognise between WoL, HoTS Beta and now. I enjoy all matchups equally, and currently feel that my ZvZ and ZvP are equal with my ZvT being weaker. I play a mostly reactionary, scouting-heavy style in ZvZ using a heavily upgraded Burrow-Roach midgame like the pros use. I like to use early Vipers in ZvP, transitioning into Ultralisks then Mutalisks. In ZvT, I am currently experimenting with [the strategies explored by Day9 in his most recent Daily on Life vs Jjakji](http://day9.tv/d/Day9/day9-daily-613-life-vs-jjakji-zvt-low-tech-style/), although I can also do a variety of 2 base plays.

---

One of the Terrans in our group is, at his peak, around rank 500 on the EU server according to [SC2Ranks](http://www.sc2ranks.com) and I can go around 40-45% winrate against him if I keep my builds well mixed. We have some Master level Protoss players as well, [one of whom successfully defeated NightEnD](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=407856) in the WCS EU S1 qualifier, who I also trade games fairly well with.

As for Zergs... well, that's where you guys come in! Ideal scenario would be picking up at least 1-2 Zergs ranked at least mid-Masters on EU, but even if I get 1 low Master Zerg from NA/KR/SEA who can swap to EU, I'd be happy with that.

I'm 1250 masters so take it with a grain of salt but I think this build is extremely strong, safe, offensive, a powerful tech switch, a little reactive but for the most part you set the momentum, and sets you in a good place vs. all toss builds. I stole this build kind of from Life, every time I saw him do his build in WoL he completely demolished his opponent, I changed it a little bit to make it fit hots better. I think his version was 3 base hydras into a muta followup. This build is stronger in hots because hydras now have speed so they can retreat, mutas have regen so they are stronger, and almost all toss open stargate so the hydra attack is going to do more damage. 

----------

**Replays:** All of these games were played on the same day when I was playing really bad, went like 8-14 that day but didn't lose a single game to a toss (my w/l before that day was 48-23 total)

http://drop.sc/339825 (lost a ton of lings, all drones at natural, and both queens to an expo 2 gate, came back and won, shouldn't say came back, wasn't really that close)

http://drop.sc/339829 (slightly bm player, screw him, also lost my first ovie to a stalker)

http://drop.sc/339831 (normal build, long game) (hydra into muta into roach/hydra into muta into roach/hydra/viper)

-------------


**The Build:**

15 pool

16 hatch (if you can try to pretend you're 15 hatching when you see the first probe, usually you can damage the probes shields and make it a lot easier to put the hatch down when you actually want it down)

17 gas

17 ovie

from there, get 2-3 queens based on preference and a spine at your natural. 

Possible modification: When the pool finishes, you should've made 2 lings, one to scout when he moves out, the other just randomly a moving all over the minimap to look for probe. If the first ling scouts that the opponent went gateway expand into walling off with an additional 3 gateways, he's doing an expand 4 gate (naniwa style, possibly with a stargate behind it), you have to change the build and get a roach warren or an extra 2ish spines and defend with speedlings or anything. Since you started 2 base, it should be a much easier hold than 3 base play and you only have to defend one spot. You can partially wall off with the roach warren too if you like. 

With gas: get speed first, then lair 


 other 3 gas at 42 supply (OFF TOPIC: 2 base builds usually get 4 queens and all 4 gas at 36 OR first gas at 17 and other 3 at 42 supply OR first two gases at 28 supply and second two at 42 supply)

Either get an expo down now or after you make your hydras/mutas (preferably a little later to play safe)

When lair is done, make an overseer and scout!! 

If you see robotics facility or robo bay, go mutas. 

If you see anything else, go hydras. If you see dt shrine, make sure you get a spine/spore for each mineral line.

--------------------

**IF YOU WENT HYDRAS**, attack with 10-16 hydras w/ speed only, an overseer for vision and detection, and maybe make ~10 reinforcement lings or so to tank. It's better to not lose the hydras so they're still a threat and you can use them later for harassment. Just try to damage the wall, make him scared, and go colossi. Also pick off any phoenix that you can if he went air. If he went air, the hydra attack should do a bit of damage, stop phoenix production, and maybe pick off a phoenix or two. After camping the bottom of his base for about 1-2 mins, go home. 

After you get enough hydras, make sure you drone up your third (get gases asap at third) and put a spire down asap. After you make your first set of mutas, get your 4th and maybe a 5th base. 

From there, you should be a ton of bases ahead of your opponent, have hydras to defend vs. drops, and are playing vs. a toss who just went colossi tech on 2 bases who now has to get blink and high templar before expoing to third. Should be an easy win. 


-------------------


**IF YOU SAW ROBOTICS AND WENT MUTAS**, Expo to your third after your first batch of mutalisks. Expo to your fourth when he's either turtling for way too long or when he tries to expo to third. Have overlords to scout for potential warp prisms (he did go robo). If he attacks, just make a ton of spines, speedlings, and base race. You should be able to win the base race. If he gets to a good phoenix count, put down double evo chamber, roach warren, and hydra den and go roach/hydra with superior economy and eventual vipers and win.",,False,,t5_2tkq6,1370207538.0,,,True,t3_1fjepu,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1fjepu/my_zvp_build_hydra_muta_or_muta_hydraroachviper/,

Now note this build is only meant as a hard counter against **gateway expands**

To start off i'm a high masters zerg (I hope that give me some credit) who after watching Lifes 10 pool 10 gas allin vs parting decided to try it out and make the build himself. After some finetuning and losses i came up with this build. 

*10 pool
*10 double extractor trick
*Cancel second extractor made (because it's the later one)
*@100% put 3 drones on gas
*11 Overlord
*11 Queen
*13 drone
*@100% gas pull drones off gas
*14 nonstop ling production until 24 supply
*24 Natural Hatchery

At this point you should have most of your lings across the map and ready to enter the main base of your opponent by 4:50. 
At this point you should move your lings straight into your opponents mineral line and go for their probes and you should be able to get a quick win if they decide to fight. If they opened up conservatively and have a zealot/stalker+mothership core and they have good probe micro move immediatly to their natural cancel/kill their Nexus and any buildings you can. At this point you can contain them until they get 3 gates up and a few sentries and you should be droning hard. Depending on their build i prefer transferring into 2 base swarmhost nydus but there are many builds you can follow this up with!

If your one muta down, GG. 25 vs 24 mutas the 25 will win with 9 mutas left that will soon recover to full HP. You cant effectively go hydras because once they get round 30 mutas spores dont matter anymore and you simply cannot defend a base. it seems there is almost absolutley no other option. If you try to fastech to roaches then the speedlings will hit in large numbers and kill the 3 roaches you have out. Because zerg can build up larve and zerglings are built so fast a sudden rush of speedings can hit your base in around 30 seconds on the smaller maps. The only counter to speedlings and banelings is speedlings and banelings of your own until you can get 10+ roaches out. Even though you spotted them coming and built some of your own its GG because yours are still hatching. Banelings just force micro up incredibly like no other matchup. Two good banelings hits can and will end the game, Its just like the muta situation in this regard.

I really hope the meta game changes soon as for the last 30 games i have had only one person win against me with anything other than mutas past 10 mins in and that was because of good macro and poor harassment by me.

Sorry for that, but I needed that much space to explain everything.

I've been putting a lot of effort into understanding HotS ZvP now that it's out. I haven't played the Beta much due to lag issues, but I've started coming up with a build that seems decent.

I'd like to share it, maybe discussing these ideas can be useful to someone else as well; or maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong.

First of all, I'd like to say that I don't have a specific build against Gateway expansions, I just kind of scout well and wing it.

Against, FFE, the opening is the normal three hatch before gas. I always get the Roach Warren (and Roach Speed), it's way too risky to skip that. From what I've seen, Protosses who want to play the macro game almost always go Stargate. They can also all in from 2 base after a Stargate opening, but that's pretty rare. The most common opening is Pheonix, with the occasional Oracle. 

If they're not going Stargate, I usually prepare for a two base all in. If they take a third with Robo or open Twilight Council into a third, it's not that hard to play against. I like to go Mutalisks against both. I used to do this with great success in WoL too, so it only got better in HotS.

Against a Stargate into a third base, here is what I do:

* I stay on a single Evolution chamber, since it feels like I'm pretty gas starved;
* Hydra Den around 8:30 if I scout the Stargate ahead of time, otherwise I drop it when I see the first Phoenixes or Oracle + Phoenixes;
* Infestation pit and 5th + 6th gases as soon as third base drops (usually around 9 minutes or so);
* 10-12 Hydras for map control, extra Queen (a total of two) for Creep spread;
* I start a fourth base and the geysers there as soon as possible.

The Infestation Pit has a great, dual purpose here. You'll find out soon why that is.

Now, I try to scout. I can escort an Overseer or two to his base with my Hydras. Protoss needs to get some form of splash damage at this point, otherwise they have a lot of trouble holding their third base against a Roach Hydra timing. I try to figure out what it is.

* If it's Colossus, I go to Hive at ~11 minutes and produce a decent batch of Roaches. I go into quick Vipers and use them to deny the Protoss fourth base or crush his army if he tries to attack too early. While keeping him on three base, I get five base, prepare Infestor tech and double upgrades, getting ready for the Storm switch and for the late game, if I can't break the Protoss;
* If it's not Colossus, I make Swarm Hosts! Also, after the initial batch of Swarm Hosts, I start a Spire. I don't know exactly how many to make, maybe 12-14 should be good. Using Storm against Swarm Hosts is almost suicidal for the Protoss; you wittle them down very quickly if they don't have Colossus, their Force Fields run out eventually. They can't possibly attack into Swarm Host/Hydra without Colossus. 

This is it, in a nutshell. Unfortunately, I don't have replays available at the moment since I'm away from home, but I'll have some in a couple of days if that makes any difference.

So yesterday I asked if 2 base lair plays are viable. The general consensus was:

* **ZvZ:** Yes

* **ZvT:** Yes

* **ZvP:** No, go 3 base

So I decided to try out 2 base mutalisk on ladder today (except ZvP, where I went for ""fast"" 3 base mutalisk play). Here are my results (and replays!)

* ZvZ: [Replay](http://drop.sc/273451)

In this game, it's a semi-clutch defense of a ling/bane all in. I lost a lot of drones, but we were about even afterwards. I honestly played so greedy and he did some aggressive pressure, but using the proper timings mentioned in my ZvZ guide (again, a little greedier) I do manage to avoid dying. 3 queen openers are a good unit. Then, I get my mutas up and he decides to try and kill me while securing his third with spores. I had a feeling that if he lost his roach army he would have nothing at home afterwards, so I accept the losses (lost my third), and bolted over to his base with muta/ling. I kill his third basically for free, and his counterswing does almost no damage (thanks to some clutch mineral (gas) walking. The mutas killed his third, the mutas killed a ton of overlords, the mutas killed his roach army multiple times...the game was won. I transitioned into roach/infestor double upgrades and, despite bad injects, manage to outproduce his final, all-in push and win the game. A great watch IMO, lots of super close moments. Key things to note: I didn't lose ANY mutas (until a shitty fight at the end, don't do that). I *never* went for his mineral line. Don't be greedy. As long as you kill his third and have a transition on the way, you're in a huge lead. I *never* tried fancy micro, or anything. I tried to trade 2 mutas for some infestors once, traded 200minerals/200gas for ~200-300 energy...not worth it. Just use the mutas for map control (if he moves out then fly in from all directions).

* ZvP: [Replay](http://drop.sc/273453) Awesome game.

I open gasless 3 hatch, take late gasses because of pylon block, and get relatively late mutas. I scouted he wasn't 2 base all-inning me, took my fourth and droned hard. I get my mutas up (and double ups), and simply out-produce him. He goes full retard and engages at his watchtower, I kill his army and easily win the game. 24 mutas, 80+ drones, and the rest 2/2 lings with the infestor transition started (and baneling nest for style :D ). In ZvP you need to do economic damage to make them worthwhile. I guess I got lucky that I was able to kill his army for free; if he was postured more defensively then I would've had to use counterattacks and multiprong to try and fight my way back in.

If you ever notice your opponent delaying storm too much...go mass baneling! Seriously, muta/ling/bane is rapesauce against a non- archon/colo/HT deathball.

IMO ZvP mutas relies on obtaining a huge macro lead through the map control you get from mutas, and capitalizing on any and every mistake your opponent makes. And upgrades.

* ZvT: [Replay](http://drop.sc/273454)

Sweet ZvT really. He opens CC first, I do Life's fast speed opener. He goes for some hellion harass (that kills a lot of lings...holy shit, he had the best hellion micro I've ever played against). He does some sort of 2 base timing (that I SEE COMING with my broverlords!), I counterattack with speedlings and win the game. I killed so many SCVs, then I retreat and (sort of) save my third. He kills it a minute later, but I still saved it in my opinion :) A double expand and infestor transition later I win with a broodlord push. I killed some SCVs with mutas, but turrets are really good when you only make 13 or so mutalisks.

ZvT Mutas: 

-**Always** counterattack with muta/speedling. If he isn't in his base, you should be. Your army is faster, you can always kill his base then retreat and save yours.

-Get baneling speed. I forgot it, but don't FFS. It helps a ton, and if you keep ~20 speedlings around you can always morph 20 banelings, which will give you a tremendous edge against bio-based armies.

-Transition quickly into hive. This is the best way to do it IMO. If you can do enough damage with your mutas, you can safely get broodlord/infestor up before he can do his 3 base 2/2/1 timing.

- Always keep a healthy unit count. Droning to 80 is nice, but surviving is better. Scouting is key, and there's no reason not to know everything about what Terran's doing when you get such a fast lair (read: overseers).

-Fast double upgrades are dope. I forgot 3/3 until super late this game, but you can usually get 3/3/crackling done in time for your broodlord push, and Zerglings just don't give a fuck about any Terrans.

* Closing Notes

I hope you guys enjoyed reading and/or watching the replays! I think that mutalisks are a great, fun way to play, despite being ""weaker"" than infestor-based play. One of the main themes of this post is counterattacking...*always* counterattack. It's so good, so powerful, and you can easily win lost games just by doing this.

1368144307.0,17,self.allthingszerg,1e1bqy,Roach hydra against Terran,WistopherWalken,18,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1e1bqy/roach_hydra_against_terran/,"I really feel like roach hydra is constantly being written off as an inferior unit composition. It's been working very well for me to the effect that I am currently 70% in ZvT at the midmasters level. For me the the matchup has become a bit of a formula. I open with the standard 15 hatch, 16 pool, 17 gas. This has four lings arriving just the standard reaper timing has it jetting into your base. Essentially I drone up to about 40 supply, take a third, then spend about 12 supply in a ling timing attack just as speed finishes. Once speed finishes, Terrans lose map control until hellions come out. The timing of this speed is such that it finishes just before hellions come out or just as they come out. With this timing you are able to do pretty significant economic damage or at the very least prevent hellions from taking map control. Once this runby commences, I drone and tech to lair heavily. I throw down my roach warren and two evos just as the lings run out of my natural. 


This runby works well with roach hydra style because it really helps you secure a couple of advantages that are important for roach hydra. First and foremost, I feel it lets you really drone heavily and tech with your map control. I am basically able to go straight to hydralisk from here as the terran licks their wounds. In addition, the economic damage allows you a faster 1/1 and 2/2 timing. I find that if you are ahead on upgrades, roach hydra trades very effectively against bio and is mostly immune to mines. Faster upgrades means that you are essentially able to hit two very powerful timings that have a good chance of denying the terran third, something I take a fourth behind. 


Of course these situations are pretty circumstantial. One assumes that you have done damage to the terran economically, but even this is not necessary. If the midgame relatively even, trading effectively with roach hydra depends heavily on positioning (i.e. engage only with concave) and staying consistent on upgrades. 


Another advantage of roach hydra is your ability to pick off medivacs while you engage the terran army. This basically makes their bio much more fragile and also heavily limits their ability to drop, which is definitely a weakness of roach hydra. 


As I've mentioned before, roach hydra really has its weaknesses as well. As expected, it is weaker to drop play, however, proper spine placement, creep spread, overlord spread (research ovie speed every time), and army splitting means that you don't really need to take any damage from drops. Another weakness is that it gets melted if you were behind on upgrades, but then again, what zerg army doesn't? Lategame where both economies are swollen, roach hydra will not be a winning composition on its own. It is less supply efficient than terran bio, and in the long run will not hold up to 3/3 bio. This isn't a problem though and you should transition to incorporating tier 3 units to supplement your army. I find that pretty much anything tier 3 adds value to roach hydra.

Some good choices:


1. Broodlords - Great for forming a sort of barrier between terran and yourself. Really messes with the bio AI too. Also helps against mines and siege tanks.

2. Infestors - not my favorite option but really makes up for the lack of aoe in roach hydra. Also useful for keeping concave, which is something you need as roach hydra.

3. Ultrakisks - always a good choice except that you need to start down the road of melee upgrades.

4. Vipers - my go to choice, really helps you survive against 3/3 bio and an absolute necessity of they opt for tanks instead of mines.


Some situations to consider:

-Playing from behind - I find that you really need a solid economy to pump out roach hydra

-High tank count - tanks will slaughter your roach hydra unless you can catch them unsieged or get a full (I mean full) surround. If you see them transitioning into large amounts of tanks, you basically can't attack until you have blinding cloud

-Attacking without concave - don't do it, you will lose the game

Nestea's original:

 Fast 3 base mutalisks 
Originally done by Nestea in the GSL, a truly amazing build that wins against robo expands and wins against robo all-ins.

While any fast mutalisk build works, this is the rough outline of Nestea's:
1) Fast gas after third (~4:30)
2) First 100 gas into ling speed, next 100 into lair
3) Drone up as usual, take 3x gas at 6:30
4) If you scout no gateway all-in, skip roach warren + evo chamber entirely
5) If you scout robo, Spire as soon as lair finishes
6) 2x gas at 7:00-7:30
If he all-ins, mass spines in your natural, sac third (leave guys mining gas) and basetrade with muta/ling. Reinforcing mutas go to his base, reinforcing lings stay in your spine forest.
If he expands, take a fourth and pressure with mutas. Honestly, you should win the game then and there. 10-15 mutas pop at 10:30; no protoss is ever prepared for that.

------

My Mods:

I do three things different:

1. TIMINGS - I switch the ling speed and lair timing, so lair is first. My ling speed still finishes in plenty of time for robo pushes.... Start spire ASAP after lair.. this will allow your mutas to get there fast.

2. NINJA A BASE - Before the protoss ever pushes out, I send a drone to a godforsaken part of the map. I build a new 3rd hatchery WAY far away on his side of the map as soon as he pushes out. For example on daybreak, if the toss starts bottom left, i take the top left.

3. NYDUS -  it costs you 3 mutas total, but it can be absurdly effective for a couple reason (2.1 -  2.3, below)

3.1 -DRONES - insta- drone transfer to your new 3rd / future bases. This one requires some explanation...  Anyway, as toss moves across the map, do your best to delay him and waste time. Baiting forcefields isnt actually necessary (Ill explain later), but you just want him to be slow. Once he finally arrives at my third, guess what he finds there? Literally nothing. I pull every drone and the queen from my 3rd and super / resaturate my natural (I say re-saturate because you will have thrown down a shit ton of spine crawlers, I usually use natural drones for this). You can then move these drones to Ninja'ed expansions...for example, if you natural is supersaturated due to pulling the drones before his army gets there, then you can then nydus them over to the third. I dont always build the nydus...You CAN simply transfer the drones all the way across the map, too...the reason is the protoss's build is so incredibly streamlined that they basically scout NO WHERE.. they just go straight to your third... you could probably even take their third in most cases just to be a dick...watch some replays, they usually never scout it...
in another scenario, sometimes i take more than one base if he deflects my mutas fairly well..in this case he will still be confined to his base, so i have time to get bases all over the map up even though I can't inflict terrible terrible damage immediately. In this case you can transfer drones all over the place more rapidly...

3.2 - LINGS the second use of the nydus, if you opt for it, is speedling transfer to his side of the map (OR DIRECTLY INTO HIS BASE; he often wont be able to stop it due to the muta flock / chaos in his base) for base race scenario.
note that the text from teamliquid.net says you should leave lings in your spine forest. with the nydus, you can actually use them offensively AND defensively if you are fast..
MOST IMPORTANT POINT ABOUT THE NYDUS. Often he will have just enough stalkers to where you dont want to engage. If you get a nydus up in his main during the chaos, just 20 lings messing with his stalkers changes this drastically...

4. UPGRADES: Mutalisk upgrades are incredibly, incredibly important. i also opt for +1 melee and+2 if possible... because i want to kill his buildings. 

Just to be clear, my goal is unequivocally a baserace. even if the game drags on, I never have any intention whatsoever of engageing his army, ever (I mean you can buy enough time to get to BL composition, no doubt.. if it makes sense do it. But really my goal is to annoy the shit out of him till he moves out, then i crush his bases). Against the immortal sentry all in, this is so beautiful because it makes all the gas he invests in sentries for forcefields worthless.... sentries are literally the worst possible thing he could build b/c they are low DPS and because I never try to engage him... except to slow him down on the way over, so they just sit there with 200 energy.

I stress that, if you hit the timings I suggest, he will not be able to break your spines because he will have to warp in in his own main - BUT EVEN IF HE DOES break your main and natural, you are still going to win the base trade scenario REALLY easily.

--other stuff that works really well--
I also try to snipe the warp prism if I think I can get it. This usually requires that your opponent is worse than you because he should be moving out earlier than you..

Again, muta upgrades are incredibly critical especially if you do damage but dont kill and decide to keep making mutas.

Always keep an eye out for an opportunity to crush his attacking army. He will be so worried about his main base that often you can either crush his main army with speedling that youve been banking behind the spines in the natural, or, if he warps in a ton of stalkers or whatever at his natural, you can just fly across the map with your flock.

GENERAL THEORY - What makes this build so incredibly abusive is two things:

You know the protoss's objective MINUTES in advance (kill your third). You do not COUNTER his build.. rather you completely SIDESTEP it. You ignore his entire army, turtle behind as many spines as you can afford, kill his shit with high DPS units like lings while he sits there, masturbating.

The protoss has to streamline so many things to make this build work that he misses basic things, like a saturated, undefended hatchery on his side of the map. Even if he should find it later, he will be so preoccupied with mutas he probably wont find it.

TL;DR, immortal sentry all in, at least up to low-masters, is stupidly easy to beat using mutas, nyduses, spines, and inducing a base trade. You'll have to practice a few times, but once you get it its GG no RE.

1334448944.0,17,self.allthingszerg,sa60r,Zerg Injection Methods,Hachrt,20,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/sa60r/zerg_injection_methods/,"I thought a topic like this might be a good one to have in r/allthingszerg

As far as I know there are 5 commonly used injection methods:

* Double-tap Method
* Brood War Method
* Backspace Method
* Minimap Method
* Camera Hotkey Method (Darkgrid Method)

I will now explain the methods as best as I understand them, though I welcome all corrections in the comments along with additional setups.  Most of the explanations use the standard hotkey set-up, adjust accordingly.

The Double-tap Method works with the idea that, since control groups bring you to the unit you have selected, having queens on separate hotkeys allows you to inject the correct hatcheries so your queens never wander all over the map.  The common usage of this method is to put one queen on the hotkeys 5, 6, and 7 with all hatcheries on 4 leaving hotkeys 1, 2, and 3 open for Units.  The depression of keys for injecting turns out looking like 55v66v77v clicking on the hatchery the queen is next to each time after pressing V.  Proponents for this method say it's easier to micro individual queens this way as well.  

* TL;DR:  Queens separated on hotkeys 5, 6, and 7 press 55v'click on hatchery'66v'click on hatchery'77v'click on hatchery'
* Two notable players that use this method are QxG.Destiny and col.CatZ. Reportedly, notable player EG.Idra uses this as well.

The Brood War Method works on the same principle as the Double-tap method in that you're double tapping your hotkeys to bring you to your hatchery's location, the difference is you're hotkeying your hatcheries separately and you're not hotkeying your queens for injecting purposes (maybe for army purposes).  The way I've seen this method done is having three hatcheries with queens separated on hotkeys 1, 2, and 3 and then every hatchery on 4 in order to spend larva more easily.  The key depression thus looks something like 11v22v33v clicking on the Queen before pressing v and then clicking on the hatchery after pressing v.  This setup is normally used, as far as I'm aware, if the player played a lot of Starcraft Brood War and they haven't changed their hotkey set-up much, hence the name.

* TL;DR Hatcheries which have queens are separate on 1, 2, and 3, all hatcheries are on 4, double tap a hotkey, click on the queen, press v, click on the hatchery, repeat.
* Liquid.Sheth and Liquid.Zenio are two notable players that use this style, or a similar concept.

The Backspace Method and Minimap Method are similar.  Both methods have all their hatcheries on one hotkey and all of their queens on the next.  Both methods select their queens, press and hold shift and then press v.   A player that uses the backspace method, without changing any hotkeys (though changing hotkeys is recommended), will use right shift instead of left shift to allow them to press backspace easier. The player will then, while holding down shift, press backspace and click on hatcheries that have queens next to them.  A player that uses Minimap injections can then click, as implied by the name, on hatcheries via the Minimap in order to inject while continuing to hold down shift.  The biggest downside to these methods, especially the Minimap method, is it's easy to have queens traveling to random locations or bases if you screw-up and misclick, if this happens the stop and hold position hotkeys are your friend.

* TL;DR: All hatcheries on 4, all queens on 5. Press 5, Press and hold down shift, press V. Press Backspace and click on hatcheries with a queen next to them or Click on hatcheries via the minimap. Changing your hotkeys for the backspace method is recommended, Common Variation to this method is to rebind the ""cycle base camera"" function to the Spacebar or the Grave Key `~ .
* Another Variation of the Backspace Inject method can be found [here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=315549).
* ItsGoSu.ViBE, vile.Spanishiwa, and Liquid.TLO are notable players who reportedly use the Backspace Method
* Note: With the backspace method you *can* leave your queens unhotkeyed and select them for injecting as you cycle through your bases.

The Screen Hotkey Method is actually something I've only seen used in the [Darkgrid Layout](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=257590) and the idea is similar to the Backspace Method. With the Darkgrid Layout you have your camera hotkeys layered with your normal keys and that those layered cameras to switch bases rather cycling through bases with backspace. Using this method is somewhat tricky at first, but here's how it works.  While a hatchery is selected press the Grave Key [on a qwerty keyboard it's above tab and to the left of 1, it's the one that makes these symbols: ` ~] this will center you on your selection.  Now hold down Control and Alt (with the way your fingers are supposed to be positioned I find it easiest to use the underside of the pinky's knuckle for control and your thumb for alt.  If you're hitting shift with the knuckle as well, that's fine with the way the hotkeys are set-up.) and press the button that the Camera is supposed to be on.  Your first base is Q your second base is W, your third base is D, your fourth is A, and your fifth is S, and your macro hatchery is on F (the reason E is skipped is because that's the key that Spawn Larva is on).  Having these camera keys is useful for more than simply injecting, they're also great for helping deal with drop harass among other applications. While injecting you select your queens, which are all on one hotkey, press and hold Shift, press E, press and hold alt, then press the keys of the bases which have queens (I find it easiest to shift my hand slightly so that my pointer is on D my pinky on shift, thumb on alt, Ring finger on Q, and Middle finger on W).  Overall, once you get used to it, it's more accurate than the backspace method with some added benefits. 

* TL;DR: With the Darkgrid Layout: Press and hold shift, press E, press and hold alt (while still holding shift), press Q, click mouse to inject, press W, click mouse to inject, Press D, click mouse to inject, release Alt and Shift. [Video Explanation and example](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmzkCzhOsf8)
* TSL_Revival uses a custom Camera Hotkey setup and does not hotkey his queens to inject.  I don't know his exact method, but it should look something like F1'click queen'V'click hatchery'F2'click queen'V'click hatchery' with the keys pressed replaced with whatever his custom keys are.",,False,,t5_2tkq6,True,,,True,t3_sa60r,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/sa60r/zerg_injection_methods/,

(example uses included),Malkov3000,28,14,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1ga1qj/tip_shiftclick_on_a_unit_icon_removes_it_from/,"Lately I have noticed a lot of zergs scouting with lings the ""hard way"" or having trouble removing unwanted units from their army control group.

I've recently written a ""guide"" for my friend to show him an easier way, and I thought it might help someone here too.

---

This is a quick and easy technique that can be used to put single ling in multiple different scouting locations.  Assume for this explanation that your main army is control group 1.

Step 1: Hit 1 to select your army.

Step 2: A-move your army to the location where you would like a single zergling to scout.

Step 3: Quickly, hold shift + left click the icon for a single zergling in the middle display of the ui.

Step 4: With your remaining army still selected, hold ctrl + 1 to reassign the army control group.

Repeat steps 2-4 for every location you want to have a single scout ling.

Step 5: With your remaining army still selected, move them back to their original position to cancel the previously issued A-move.

This technique allows you to A-move a single zergling to each of multiple different locations very quickly, while simultaneously removing those zerglings from your main army control group.

You can this same trick to easily remove drones, overlords, queens, and anything else that accidentally gets stuck in your army control group.

Once the muscle memory took over, I found myself using this to counter multi-drops.  I A-move my army to one drop location and quickly remove enough units to clean it up before sending the rest to the other drop site.

As i said, my matches take very long to no avail..i defend and defend and everything is ok until that freaking terran/protoss completes his ""deathball""(i heard that's how you guys call it) and i lose. 

Also everytime ,once the lategame arives it feels like i never have enough gas and i can't produce my units fast enough...minerals are ok

The games that i lose to an early attack i watch the reply and i understand what i did wrong..that is good..but those matches are incredibly tiring..i feel like i dont want to play anymore.

I watched the video guides of Apollo, but i never saw him having a lategame match so besides scouting tips and a starting build order i can't find anything.( Correct me if i'm wrong,i would gladly go and watch the zerg episodes again).

(Works for lower than masters as well).",AndyWilson,20,6,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/14tqx2/5_steps_to_winning_masters_level_zvzs_i_used_to/,"I've always had issues with ZVZ. At least ZVZ's that involved me building roaches. I always went with the ling/infestor/ultra style. But that style is simply not viable on some maps (Like Ohana, Entombed Valley, Shak Plateau.) 

This meant I would sometimes have to play standard roach based zvz. This would basically always make me lose. I just didn't know how to navigate the match up. 

But then I came up with 5 steps that have lead to me winning most of  my zvz's. I actually enjoy the match up now, and winning is easier than ever for me. (I don't go ling/infestor/ultra anymore, because this works so well). 

Note: This will probably not work for people who are above mid-masters. But it's been working for me pretty well at a lower/mid master level. 

So here are the 5 steps.

1. Don't die to anything stupid. (Ling all-ins.)
2. Try to snipe their third, defend yours from being sniped.
3. Macro (Roach/infestor - hyrdas once you have your third saturated)
4. Try to snipe a base as you/they are trying to take a 4th. You can snipe a base with burrowed infestors, or their 4th with a swell of lings.
5. Wait for them to do something stupid. 

I've found that if you just macro, and don't make any stupid mistakes. Your opponent will almost always do something really, really stupid. 
Like attacking into a choke, or forcing a bad engagement. 
Seriously, all you have to do is wait. You can count on them making a huge error that will basically kill them on the spot. 

Once I stopped trying to force engagement or make anything happen in the late game, and just started counting on the fact my opponent will do something really stupid. I started winning a lot more. 

It seems like zergs just don't know how to handle the late game. Obviously this won't work in top masters or above. Since they will know how to handle the late game, and won't do anything stupid. But everyone else you can depend on them throwing the game away eventually. 

Once I changed my mindset from ""trying to win"" to ""waiting for them to throw the game away"". I started winning a lot more ZVZs. 

Hopefully this is helpful to you in some way.

I am Gold league (At the platinum end). I think I play near perfect for the first 6 minutes. Money shoots up in the mid-game. I think it is because I do not have enough gas maybe.

(I am still at the level where 1 base Protoss crops up from time to time... so exceptions apply)

I want to play safe. I do not need to play a perfect game. How many units should I have at what time to be able to reinforce and hold an attack? Or when I scout at 7 minutes what should I be looking for to identify the 2 base all in? Hell what unit composition should I have. I really have no idea?

",Highblade,21,6,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/x5yxl/zergs_most_economical_opening/,"Hello, I'm a Mid Masters - High Masters Zerg and this thought has been playing on my mind for a while now since Homestory Cup. 

I remember Idra stating during a cast that most zergs don't tend to drone scout when they hatch first these days because if the enemy overlord sees your drone coming he can just throw down a 15 pool into 15 hatch instead and come out more economically ahead. 

Ever since he said that i've been contemplating WHY zergs have been going hatch first if thats the case. I went into a few custom games and tested how economical Pool Into hatchery is in terms of larvae production and have found out a few things.

** 15 Pool Into 15 Hatchery **

* The Natural hatchery should finish around 4:20 which is when it starts producing larvae, and the first inject cycle should finish at 4:40 provided you start your queen at 16 supply when your pool finishes. 

* The 2nd queen should also finish by the time the first inject finishes roughly. Which Means your 2nd and 3rd Inject Cycle Finishes at 5:30.

* Which in total means by the 5:30 mark this opening has left you with a total of 3 inject cycles completed (12 Larvae) and the expansion should have spawned in total 4-5 Larvae (1 every 15 seconds).

* Which means a total of 16-17 larvae has produced between 4:20 and 5:30

** 15 HATCH 16 POOL **

* Your natural expansion should finish around 3:50 which is when it starts producing larvae every 15 seconds. both of your queens should have also been started by now.

* By 5:25 Your 1st and 2nd Inject cycle should now be finishing which means 8 larvae have been produced by the queens at this point.

* Your natural expansion has been left to produce 1 larvae every 15 seconds for 1minute 40 seconds which is 6-7 larvae.

* So in conclusion this means a total of 14-15 larvae has been produced in comparison to the 16-17 of the pool first build. 

So my question is fellow zergs. Why are so many of us still going hatch first in the match up of ZvT and ZvZ if Pool first is actually more economical and safer against early pools / funky barracks pressure. Or is there something i've overlooked during this whole investigation.

Would love to hear your feedback.

Lets learn it!,scrible102,19,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/uebtx/im_tired_of_people_complaining_about_zvz_lets/,"In ZvZ, there are many all in options that people like to charge for. These can be good fast game ending options, but this is my favorite lategame matchup. Why wouldnt I wanna play it?

Heres my opener.

* 15 hatch
* 15 pool 
* 17 gas
* 16 OL (save money after and when your OL pops 2 queens and 3 sets of lings)
* 24 spine
* 24 bane nest (before speed)

Then get speed and take 1 guy off of gas.

* note: If he goes 15 hatch. send your lings. You might get a free queen if he was greedy. If he goes 14 14 he will have speed before you and you don't want to lose your first 6 lings.

* Can be risky on 2 player maps as it can be vulnerable to 6/7/8/9/10 pools
At this point you need to be very aware of ling all ins or a bane bust. Build mass ling/banelings accordingly. Block your ramp with queens if you need to.

Drone during passive times. You need to be aware as possible of his tech and army/drone count to know if hes all inning you.

Once you are at 44-52 drones, start (4 gas, a Lair, Roach Warren, and a Evo Chamber(for upgrades and in case they go for mutas)). As you build structures, replace the drone. Once you have money, before everything pops, start your third base. (assuming hes not all inning you).

When your buildings finish, start +1 missle range and roach speed. You are also going to want to start a fester pit OR hydra den (depending one what tech you want). Build nothing but roaches until your 3rd hatchery is done. Do a +1,0 speed timing attack. Behind this attack, build drones.

Once you have droned your third you should have pathogen glands almost complete and +2 missle range on the way. Do another timing on +2,0 with festers, take 4th and start toward hive tech and taking gas.


This is a really basic ZvZ build that a lot of good players will do. I hope it helps stir up the brain for new ideas and get you out of the habit of cheesing every time you end up with a ZvZ.

There's no way to tell if they're charged or on cooldown, even if you can detect them, and they can destroy an entire army with absolutely no micro on the part of the Terran.  They are particularly hard to deal with as zerg, because there is no real way to detect them effectively.  Terran can scan, and Protoss has observers, so they can detect without getting the observers killed.  Whenever I try to go to take out widow mines, they take out my overseers before I can kill them, which leaves me with no detection, and often supply blocks me.

15 hatch  
16 pool  
4 Queens

@ 100 gas, Roach Speed  
@~8:30, ~20 Roaches (Uses these to pressure front, secure 3rd base)  
@~10:15 (after droning for 3rd) Burrow, Tunneling claws, ROACHES  
@~11:00, +2/+2  
  
The big burrowed roach attack hits around 11:30.
  
Things to note:  
-Never gets Zergling Speed  
-+1/+1/Roach Speed all finish at the same time, just as the first ~2- roaches come out!  
-The initial 20 roaches create a hole in the Terran's wall in which allows his burrowed roaches to later enter the base.  
-Used against a Terran clearly playing a macro style game.  
  
I love these kinds of huge pressures that allow for Zerg to also expand safely behind it, and anything using alternative ways to get into a base (Drops, Nydus, Tunneling Claws) are always exciting and have a huge element of surprise, something Zerg semi-lacks compared to P and T.

1355205524.0,15,self.allthingszerg,14nhm0,[D] A redesign of the Infestor/Swarm Host,EsperCraft,19,4,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/14nhm0/d_a_redesign_of_the_infestorswarm_host/,"I've really been thinking about the Infestor after this patch and I'm fully aware this post will result in no change, but I still think it's a healthy exercise to theorycraft and it's fun too.  To pretense and explain the title, this post is focused on the Infestor, but I mention the Swarm Host because I think it should be a mutation off of the Infestor (explained later in post).

I'm not going to include Neural Parasite in this post as it's very rarely used in high level play.  I've always viewed the Infestor as a support caster either bolstering your own army (infested terran) or hampering the enemy army (fungal growth).  However, Blizzard turned the Infestor into a staple unit able to spawn near full armies and able to condemn groups of units through chain fungals.  Basically the unit could function on its own and this in my opinion is a severe design flaw.  The egg nerf for Infested Terrans I think was a good idea, although I'm not sure how I feel about ITs not getting upgrades.  Regardless I'm happy to see how this pans out.  The spell that I think needs a major overhaul (I propose a completely new ability) is Fungal Growth.

**New Ability: Desecration**

* Energy Cost: 75 [same as fungal]
* Radius: 2 [same as fungal]
* Duration: 4 seconds [same as fungal]
* Range: 11
* Description: Desecrates the ground and air snaring ground units and slowing air units by 75% after 1 second.  Units affected by Desecrate have their armor reduced by 1 and are revealed if cloaked for 4 seconds.  Effect can stack.

*Rationale:*
I never liked Fungal doing damage.  When Blizzard put in the +dmg to armored I felt like this was a band-aid fix and stubbornness to not buff Hydralisks.  As far as Fungal Growth being a missile...fungus grow on the ground, why is it flying through the air?  I know it's a matter of semantics but it still shows how the ability has been used as the ""tweak this to fix the race"" ability.  I think that the Desecrate ability affords Zerg three primary benefits: (1) The ability to manipulate the area where battles take place, (2) Directly support main attacking units without being viable as a singular unit, (3) Variation in the use of the ability

The third point is really what I want for Zerg more than anything else.  It pains me watching SC2 matches where amazing warp prism micro, marine splitting, blink stalker micro, or force field placement literally tip the battle in the favor of the player with better control.  I love watching these plays but I lament the fact that aside from setting up flanks and good baneling movement there is little Zerg can do to influence a fight.  My proposed desecrate ability can be used in a multitude of ways not just lock down the army and either chain fungal or a-move to win.  You can desecrate on an army to force them to move, behind an army to force them to stay, block retreat paths, cut off flanks, cast them quickly to stack the debuff, cast them spread apart to hold an army in place, etc.  The 1-sec cast time is super important because that is what forces the opponent's hand and also adds an element of skill when chaining the ability.  With fungal the instant cast and even a fast missile makes chaining the ability too easy.  It should not function as a ""one and done"" spell where if you hit that first fungal the chain is basically idiot-proof.  Instead of chasing units with fungal you can manipulate army movements with desecrate.


**New Ability: Morph to Swarm Host**

* Cost: 100 minerals, 100 gas
* Duration: 30s
* Requires Hive

**Swarm Host New Ability: Host Infested Terran**

* Cooldown: 30s
* Description:  The Swarm Host spawns an Infested Terran and hosts it within its body.  The Swarm Host can hold up to 5 Infested Terrans.

**Swarm Host New Ability: Release Swarm**

* Cooldown: 0s
* Description:  The Swarm Host releases all Infested Terrans it has spawned.  The Swarm Host must be burrowed to use this ability.

*Rationale:*
The idea of Zerg having a primary general use unit and having it morph into a specialized unit (Hydra=&gt; Lurker, Zergling=&gt; Baneling, Mutalisk=&gt;Guardian/Devourer, Overlord=&gt;Overseer) is a cornerstone of the Zerg tech structure in my opinion.  The Swarm Host becomes a specialized Infestor losing its multiple spells and specializing in Infested Terrans.  The biggest issue I've seen with Swarm Hosts is they need to be baby sat because (1) they don't spawn locusts very quickly and (2) the locusts don't hit air.  Therefore they don't actually feel ""Zergy"" because they force your army to become immobile.  Swarm Hosts with the new proposed abilities provide army support, can be used to harass, can function just like the swarm host and ""siege"" a position at spawn intervals (but now it requires micro to release them).  Infestors can spawn up to 8 Infested Terrans at full energy, Swarm Hosts can only have up to 5 but they are released immediately.  Again, I think this gives a greater diversity to the strategies Zerg can do.

Moving both burrow and overlord speed to hatch tech was supposed to give Zerg more options to tech laterally without the vertical requirement of Lair tech.  Even still we're finding that the gas investment is the true limiting factor in many cases, and the early 100/100 investment for either research can doom you in early game pushes.  Why?  Because burrow demands a follow-up to roaches effectively, and overlord speed only increases your likelihood of seeing tech, it gives you no actual gain in combat.

I propose that the Overseer be moved to evolution chamber instead of Lair as the requirement.  The base movement speed is faster than an overlord (move OL speed back to Lair) and contaminate has the ability to disturb the macro of the opponent (the same effect as burrowing to deny expansions, mining, or tipping the scales in early game engagements)  Lets look at how the timing would work.

* 35 second evolution chamber build time
* 17 second morph time
* 133 second energy gain time

The standard zerg macro opener involves gas around 6 minutes which would provide some nice options for gas allocation aside from roach, upgrade, or lair.  Assuming 6 minute gas and evolution chamber you'll be able to throw down a single contaminate around the 9 minute mark.

How would this change affect each matchup?

* **ZvP** - Immortal/sentry as the premiere early-game push will have to be careful with the overseer available earlier.  a 6 minute start to overseer would time out right around the 9 minute mark, when immortal/sentry moves out.  
* **ZvT** - The early overseer helps with scouting more than anything else.  Being able to identify the number of each production structure tells a lot about what's coming.  I know cloak banshees have fallen out of favor but the detection will also help with early widow mine contains so you don't have to creep crawl with a spore to clear a mine at your third.
* **ZvZ** - Honestly, this matchup scares me with the change, I don't know how it would work out.  I think it would severely promote a macro hatchery for one thing.  I also think it would help curb the absurd rushes to mutalisk that I feel plague ZvZ.  Instead of ZvZ being a contest of who can cheat their tech the most, it will allow for play that disturbs your opponent beyond a baneling bust.

It's important to remember that contaminate is not a guaranteed proposition.  If it gets killed en route to whatever it's going to contaminate, that's a huge opportunity cost for naught.

TLDR; I think moving overseer to require evolution chamber instead of Lair would do the following 3 things in a general sense:

* Dissuades macroing on small numbers of production facilities
* Allows the zerg to disturb macro without actually attacking
* Increases zerg gas allocation early game, but does not pigeonhole them into a strategy so early",,False,,t5_2tkq6,False,,Master NA,True,t3_18jsyt,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/18jsyt/more_theorycrafting_overseer_at_evolution_chamber/,

So lets think back to the good old days when fruitdealer was around. He would get drop and burrow every single game and it pretty much won him a GSL title. No matter what you think of the play back then it has completely fallen off the scene for pretty much no reason other than people cutting corners. 

Recently Hyun and Symbol have been throwing in drop builds now and then but you hardly ever see the upgrade even though it isn't expensive (if you compare it to the cost of medivacs and warp prisms and rather than losing the investment you just lose an overlord so it only gets more cost effective the more you use it). You see burrow a good deal more but never with drop and overlord speed. 

So recently ive started simply winning games easily like the games were not even a little bit close by getting all 3 upgrades fast. It works best in ZvP from what ive seen like ive taken down players doing blink stalker all ins by just burrowing lings for instance. Ive won against sentry immortal both with baneling drops, burrowed banelings and dropping the main when they go out on the map and being really annoying. 

Even mid game and late game it is great so why don't people do it more is my question? It seems like something that is incredibly imbalanced if you have good decision making. If you want some replays I can show some off but its pretty self explanatory. 

Side note: if you are below diamond id suggest having 1 overlord hidden away with 4 banelings and when you spot them leaving their base shift queue the drop in and kill the probes at an expo.

* appeal to the general population of zerg players by showing REAL ladder games I personally played, rather than professional games for the shoutcasting side of things (not trying to be Husky 2)

**some things I have changed since starting this channel a little over a month ago:**  
* I now edit my videos to remove the strange video glitches I get from XSplit in the beginning of the recording process (some older videos still have this)  
* I am replacing my microphone this week to improve the sound quality (if anyone has tips to remove noise, they would be greatly appreciated)  
* I have created overlays for the replay timer and purchased a webcam so that I can show a little more presence in each video.  
* I am planning to re-do/replace some of my earlier videos with strategy/transition concepts that may not have been well illustrated due to game-ending luck. (ie- ZvP 10 pool opening video)

I work 20-25 a week to pay for rent/food/bills but otherwise primarily focus on SC2. For the past couple months I've also hired a guy to come over 4-5 days a week and help me out with analyzing all of my sc2gears game data.

The friends I currently rent an apartment with are not very big into SC2. This doesn't negatively effect my practice but I think it would be very helpful if I had roommates who were as dedicated and interested in SC2 as I am.  I would like to set up a pseudo team house/apartment  somewhere in the US with people that have a living situation similar to mine.

It wouldn't really cost anything aside from moving expenses.  Everyone would continue working low level wage jobs to pay the bills. It would be a normal ""renting an apartment with friends"" situation. In this case though everyone would happen to be an aspiring SC2 professional.

Any thoughts or interest in the idea?

I've gone 12-22 since that time, with a 9 or 10 game losing streak mixed somewhere in there. And 2 of those wins are against Gold players, another 2 of those are against Silver players.

I spent most of my WoL ""career"" playing Protoss and Terran in Platinum League, but sometimes I would get in Diamond.

HotS rolls in and I am completely garbage with Terran and Protoss. Well, statistically speaking, you could say that I am doing just very well. I have 59% in my PvX and 48% TvX. My TvX is only this low because of TvT ( 33% ), my TvZ is 67% and TvP is 56%.

But I really dislike the current TvX and PvX match-ups, specially the mirrors. I find the current metagame of those matchups incredibly fun to watch, but I hate with passion to play them. I was about to call it quits and stop playing HotS and just enjoy it as an spectator, but before stopping I decided to play some Unraked Zerg just to see if I could find some enjoyment in SC2, and to my surprise, it was quite fun. Even without knowing any BO/timings of Zerg, I still managed to have fun even when losing. Swam Hosts are incredibly fun to use, and Mutas are like Phoenix, but better and I dare to say, a bit easier to use. 

I enjoy Ling/Bling/Muta style a lot, and from the little zerg knowladge that I have, it seems like a viable style in all 3 match-ups but I have no idea how to execute it, in fact, my Zerg basic mechanics are pretty garbage. I can keep good injects for the first 8min, but thats about it. I have some general idea of unit compositions, and what to build, but I have no idea what the timings for gas, tech builds, units are.

I have been playing sc2 since beta. During the beta stages I was a random player trying to figure out what races I was going to play, pretty much like everyone else. It was during the beta that I chose to be a Protoss player. Since then, I've always been a Protoss player. I was a master league Protoss player on NA/EU for quite some time. I quit sc2 last year. I have since then come back to it at the end of December/January.

I still play at a low master level as Protoss... but something wasn't right. I wasn't enjoying the game like I should have. I was doing decently on ladder, smashing faces, taking points, all the above. But it just wasn't fun anymore. Because it wasn't that fun I wasn't getting any better at the game.

So I thought about it long and hard and I've switched to Zerg. Why Zerg? Well, to be honest since the beta I felt as if Zerg was ""too hard"" for me. I wasn't that good of a player and it wasn't my style. I've always envied Zerg players for their macro abilities and all that. To put it simply, I feel as if my play style has always been that of a Zerg.

I've been playing Zerg for all of a day and I play at a diamond level. It's riveting. It's enjoyable. It's exciting. It's frustrating.

Good day my fellow Cerebrates!


It saddens me to see the number of Cerebrate younglings who are having trouble combating our lesser brethren known as the Protoss.
So I've gone to great effort in an attempt to prove the lesser Protoss Executors (of rank Platinum and below) can be crushed with nothing more than the simple Zergling.


**There were two stages to my plan:**


The first was to masquerade as a lesser Cerebrate in order to lure the weaker Executors into battle, only to crush them with the powerful yet often underestimated Zergling.


The memories of my victories have been included in 'replay' format.
Mass ling vs ladder:


**Silver:**

As you can see my strategy of “lots and lots of units regardless of what they are” works well into mid Diamond.


The second was to challenge them to combat after informing them of my plans.


**High Platinum:**

**Bonus:**

The most LOL worthy troll game I've played was mass hydra ling vs a high Platinum Terran.

**Disclaimer:**

Although this build CAN get you into Diamond I'm not trying to tell you it's a 'good' build, and any good Protoss who knows how to macro and scout can beat it... but it is fun as hell!


The name of the game is **MACRO**, drone hard, expand often, hit your injects, mass units, win the game.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------


Because of some misunderstandings last time I posted this I'd like to emphasize **This is not a  good build! Literally any unit is better vs Protoss than Zerglings, that's the point.** Regardless of how ridiculous the build is, I didn't drop a game vs Protoss until I started playing mid Diamond players, until then **nothing matters but macro** and my macro isn't even that good.

There seems to have been a surge in the amount of mech being played on the ladder since IEM Cologne and ever since then i just haven't been able to deal with it appropriately. 


I was wondering how some other high level zerg players tend to open against terran players that might be going mech, i find it almost impossible to play safe against bio whilst still being able to hold off any  Mech terran. I find it hard to actually identify mech until its too late, a fast 3rd base leaves me on the defensive and stops me from pushing across map and actually scouting other than my first overlord getting scouting information i'm playing blind and I feel i have no choice. If that overlord doesn't manage to identify if its mech or bio i'm stuck in Limbo. 
If I open with roach ling I feel at a disadvantage to any marine maurader medivac pushes if the terran went for fast double upgrades.


Not only do i have trouble identifying its actually mech until its too late but I also have trouble getting a composition that can actually deal with the pushes. if the terran opens up reactor hellion banshee, the banshees are enough to keep me in my base the entire time unless the terran gets sloppy and some how manages to lose them. Oversees and queens are too slow to chase them across map, roaches have been picked off by banshees by the time I reach the terran base in order to counter attack. Fast teching to broods seems impossible because 1 scan on your hive and the terran is just gonna march across the map and destroy you. Muta's are useless due to the sheer amount of spare minerals a terran has playing mech they can just use to spend on turrets. Ling runby's / Roach Runby's feel like a waste of supply coz I usually end up running into either 1 tank holding off the entire attack due to good positioning or a planetary fortress being repaired 24/7. Making base races impossible. 


And on the off chance I do manage to actually hold on until the late game vs a meching terran blue flame hellions can dismantle my slow broodlord army by picking away at my income. I feel like you need an absurd amount of spine crawlers in order to actually kill the hellions before they make it behind your mineral line and fire 3 shots off to roast an entire drone line. 


Any tips would be a great help, or how you tend to open / the decision making process. And please only give serious suggestions, I don't need some bronze level zerg to tell me to build more roaches.

I am well aware that I am leaving out variations Protoss's fast expanding, but just wanted to get this out there. 

Given the popularity of FFE in ZvP, I found myself struggling with ways to be aggressive that would help me secure an advantage but not put me all in. I found that 8 and 11 pools weren’t precisely my style, I prefer not to be so aggressive, but a 12 pool 14 hatch allowed me a certain amount of flexibility in the early game which I love. This entire build is predicated on the idea that Protoss is fast expanding. I am playing at the high platinum level so we can’t say tip top play but the concept I am aiming for is a way to punish exceedingly greedy play while transitioning into a 3 hatch, delayed Stephano Style ZvP.  Even if Protoss is going cannon first, and shuts down the aggression cold the Zerg is still at an ok place and well able to recover.


The Build Order
*9 Overlord
*3 Drones
*12 Pool 
*14 Hatch
*6 Zerglings
*17 Overlord
*1 Queen
*21 Hatch

**The Beginning Phases**


In this build we go without scouting and instead use our 2nd overlord at the natural to approximate the position of the Protoss. The inbound direction of Probe and Time of arrival will indicate the best order to send first initial zerglings. Probe and Pylon blocking can be problematic, but pulling two Drones to attack the Probe or simply going for your “third” as your first expansion are equally viable options.  We can dive into a few scenarios from here, detailing the Protoss build order as a distinguishing


1.	Forge, Nexus, Cannon.
    

    a.	Pretty common on smaller maps, the obvious target is to get a good surround on the cannon, 6 zerglings will easily DPS it down in no time. The pylon should be targeted if the Cannon has a lengthly build time remaining and you can stop its construction even then I generally prefer the cannon.


    b.	Smart Protoss will pull probes, this is also a win for Zerg. Workers gather minerals at ≈40 minerals per minute not accounting for closer patches or stacking workers.  Six lings is not a death knell, but even “A-moved” zerglings should be able to kill some of these workers. Ideally you can abuse the mineral patches to make your lings even more effective.   


2.	Nexus First
    

    a.	On larger maps this aggression comes at a very awkward time against Nexus first, I advocate killing the first pylon then moving straight into the mineral line. You want to mind surrounds between the Nexus and minerals, but barring that you are still coming out well ahead. 


3.	Forge, cannon, Nexus or gateway i.e. full wall or Cannon Completed
    

    a.	Again the discerning Protoss will count your Drones and suspect something cheeky is going to be happening. Part of the reason I like to get that hatch down and hopefully have it scouted is to encourage the idea that I am not committed to aggression but defense with that earlier pool,  (Showing a fear of cannons or just generally poor play). But even if the wall is finished or there is a cannon finished we don’t want to suicide our lings. The Protoss player had to do one of a few things to make that happen


    i.	In the case of a full wall his nexus is delayed.
    

    ii.	Forge, Double Gateway means aggression but tech is very delayed and you should be able to manage enough lings to fend it off. 


    b.	In these cases we take map control from the Protoss handily. With six zerglings, you can take the Xel’Naga Watchtowers, set others to patrol paths which Protoss would use to establish forward pylons, and otherwise hold complete control over the map. 

There are also a few scenarios, which I have had experience with where this has also proven equally viable.


1.	Proxy Gateways
    a.	Non issue with a spine (or queens), depending on how many Zealots are made before attacking. 


2.	Cannon Rushs
    a.	Essentially hard countered unless there is superb pylon positioning.

I was kind of surprised to see people having a lot of trouble with protoss, as it was my best matchup last season. So, I'm here to share my super awesome build.

Notes: This kind of relies on your opponent not being a little bitch and turtling. If they just keep taking bases and walling with buildings, you're not going to have a good time with this.

Build: Standard 3 hatch opening vs FFE

09 overlord

15 pool

16 hatch

15 overlord

15 2x lings

-- 3 sequential queens. You want the first one from the main, the second one from the main, and the third one from the natural. Only one queen making at a time. Inject once at the natural with your first queen, then spread creed/go to the third
24 hatch

24 overlord

30 overlord

-- drones~~

@6:00 double gas

@6:30 if toss has gas no gas at natural -&gt; roach warren, speed with first 100 gas. Prepare for an attack. Otherwise...

(If you see a pheonix, and it's killing an overlord, build a single spore at each base. Rally your overlords and queens to them to protect them, and just build drones. A stargate opening delays any all in from protoss considerably)

@first 100 gas: lair

macro hatch when your minerals run high.

@7:00 roach warren/evo (+1 range, if you see a third before it's done, cancel and switch to melee. It's only to help defending all ins)

@second 100 gas -&gt; speed, double gas, second evo (carapace)

@60 drones: UNITS. Pure roach ling until you see a third. 

@toss third: Take fourth, make only drones, take the rest of your gasses. You want to get up to 80-90 drones.

@100% lair -&gt; infestation pit

@100% infestation pit -&gt; Hive

@100% hive -&gt; adrenal/ultralisk cavern

@100% ultralisk cavern -&gt; You should have enough gas for 8-9 ultras. (These pop ~14 minutes)

THINGS TO NOTE:
After protoss takes a third, you're only going to make lings, drones, and overlords

Ultras WILL pop for any 3 base collosus push. Don't engage with pure lings unless he's literally sitting on one of your mining bases. 

If you see voidrays at any point -&gt; drop a hydra den. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON HYDRAS YET. Kill his army with the ultra/ling ball first, remax on hydra/ultra. 

Worst case scenario, where he gets too many voidrays, or you're getting pushed back, start pathogen glands, and get a hydra/infestor ball. (Start range upgrades too). Hydra infestor beats mass voids pretty handily.

If toss is holding on, I throw down double spire and prepare for a hard broodlord switch.



Replays! ~ A number of these were against gateway expand. Same idea, you just get your third after tech.

If I scout it and hold, I find I'm unable to trade cost-efficiently v midgame terran and protoss.  My vZ games never make it that far.

My questions for ya'll:

* should I shift my play style to a more aggressive early game with a later expand?

* mutas vT midgame are useless due to cannons/marines/widow mines. Should I waste gas on infestors or rush to ultras?

* my swarm hosts (with hydra and roach back up) get creamed against colo/immortal if I push. Am I relegated to turtling?

In the first game it was against a Colossi-Voidray composition, in the second it was against a harass-focused void ray / warp prism play, and in the third game it was against a toss turtling into skytoss.

Some key tactics used:

* Swarm hosts as the back bone of the late game zerg army as either a way to cause free damage or force engagements
* Building of excessive static defense at key points of the map, and around bases.
* Use of fungal's new range as a way to deal with slow units that clump, like templar and void rays.
* Holding fragile units like hydras back until after splash damage was removed by locusts, as well as a way to provide dps after abductions.
* Tactical remax decisions (hydra vs ultra vs corruptor vs swarm host) based on enemy's army composition

It looks very accurate for the first several minutes, given a specific build order that currently has to be hard coded. I'm trying to simulate worker mining rates as best possible, taking into account cluster saturation, larvae injection, and all that mess.

Next up will be expansion simulation and optimizing the number of workers transferred, and workers purchased. When it's done, it outputs to the console the times to purchase the unit (gametime), and displays a graph of your resources over time, and unit purchases, using matplotlib.

I've actually losing every ZvZ right now. It was my best matchup back when I was Diamond league and below. I've opened 14/14 put on some pressure and macro'd behind it. I've never done any Bling all-ins or anything like this. I had no buildorder no timings or whatsoever maped out though and only played by feeling. It worked perfectly. The only thing I had trouble with is Ling/Infestor -&gt; Ultralisk style. But as it is quite uncommon on ladder this wasn't a big deal for me.
Now I switched to Hatch First as it is more common these days and just the better macro opener I suppose. But my ZvZ is so bad since I switched. (probably 2 months ago or so) Right now I'm on a 10 game losing streak and I always lose no matter what my opponent does.
Once I lose against Bling All-Ins, then against Mass Muta, then against some Mutas into Roach/Infestor, then against Roach/Infestor, then against Ling/Infestor. It's like everytime I now my mistake against one composition. I get owned by another one. I really don't like to use mutas in this matchup. They don't seems stable to me at all, because you don't have any roaches when they pop normally. And a well performed timing would kill you. (atleast that's what I did back in diamond, where I won every game against muta players)
Roach/Hydra loses against Mass muta I feel and Roach/Infestor is pretty annoying to deal with Mutas.
Ling/Infestor seems to be pretty strong to me, but I've never tried it myself. (actually I wonder why not more pros are using it? maybe someone can answer this)

It's really like I have NO idea when to get my gases/roachwarren/evochambers/lair/infestation pit/3rd. 

Is there any pro who uses Roach/Infestor style in ZvZ with great success and streams with enabled VODs so I can learn from it?

I recently started playing sc2 again on ladder, and after some racing hopping I am back to zerg. But I do have some questions regarding some 'base mechanics'. 

How do you all handel queen injects and overlord management? I think I have the inject down with the base cam method, although only today just learned you can shirt click instead of hopping to every base and hitting v.

What I have most problems with is overlord management, I always have them float to the rally point where I am rallying all of my army. What is the best way to prevent this? Start overlord production and CTRL click them somewhere else, and then reselect bases and start producing units (or vice versa)?

Regarding tech buildings, is it best to build these at the natural or your main base?

Also any tips on how to improve creep spread is welcome :)

Right, I'm in Plat and I like to think I do pretty ok for myself, however recently I'm having an issue with a Protoss who turtles up, gets tech and takes his third.  

Normally, I open standard, drone like a boss and keep an eye on the Protoss player.  I take bases pretty well, and macro up.  Just as it becomes time to make units, I see the Protoss player move to take his third.  It's on Akilon Wastes.  By the time I have a half decent army, I know he'll have a gateway/cannon wall up at the third, and a wall at the front, so I take a fourth, then get my army together.  

After checking the replay, I've got a ""good"" roach hydra army, and a better economy.  If I'm listening to what I've been told, from here all I want to do is trade roughly evenly, and eventually I'll win.  But against a wall, with FF's, a couple of voids, and a colossi or two, I can seem to find absolutely no way to trade without easily losing double the resources.  Any corruptors I add get shredded, and hive is a while away.


I notice it's not going well, and take like 5 bases and all gasses, but really, by the time he's been allowed to sit on 6 gasses, he just walks out with a (what I've found to be) fairly unkillable comp (void, colossi, zealot, storm I think) army and pushes for the gg.

Everything I've read has told me that, until Diamond/Masters, I should be able to win on Lair tech, and should focus on denying the third of a protoss, but if the protoss isn't hitting a timing, that third can be taken at around 8 minutes, which is just when I'm finishing up droning, and have no real army to speak of.  So by the time I do, it's pretty well defended.  Maybe it's just Akilon, but the natural ramp and third entrance are so close together, that defending both is a cinch.  

Is there something fundamental I'm missing, does it seem?  
If a Protoss is ever foolish enough to leave his wall before we've started trading, I can generally crush them, but if they hide away and wait for that big tech army, I really struggle.

Any proposed solutions?  

I'm at work, but can upload some replays tomorrow afternoon if it's needed.

Also, I have a pretty poor timing knowledge, as I only really play a couple of hours, 2 nights a week, but that's just something I'll have to live with :)

I am trying to address an issue that is probably the reason I have been stuck in platinum for so long. It doesn't have anything to do with micro or strategies (yet).

While I do know the importance of the three key elements: drones, scout and creep, and try as hard as I can to focus on them, I find myself often confused or forgetting one or two of them while in the heat of the moment (literally, hellions/hellbats).

Yes, it is clear to me that I need to practice it endlessly and improve them seperately and then combined... But I feel as if I am missing something. Some key element or an elusive concept, order or trick to get them in balance.

Some games, I die because I was droning perfectly but didn't see shit coming my way (scout/creep fail). Some too many units and not enough dmg done (drone fail), and sometimes I just get skytossed (pure scout fail).

This is a plead for help, from all you masters/GMs around here. Please, share your most preciouse and hidden lightbulb moments about the balance of the holy zerg trinity. I know I got the apm for it, I just need to fix my brain. Exercises are soooo welcomed.

Love you all,

So zergs must do what they have done throughout their whole existence in Starcraft 2, adapt! So, how do we go from muta wars to roach hydra wars? Well I am also new to the concept due to me barely scratching the top of gold back in WoL, but now I am a mid / high masters zerg on NA and working my way up EU. Right now I have a 70% W/L vs zerg, (and the 30% is only due to my terrible ability to hold ling bane all ins), so maybe I can help!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Let's get to the point of the subject, a build for ZvZ in which adapts to the new layout of the match up forced upon us by Blizzard. We start with the regular opening 15 hatch 15 pool, or 15 pool 15 hatch to be safe, and gas afterwards. Then we get the normal 100 gas speed and 50 gas banes to be safe. Shortly after we will have extra gas. What do we do with that gas? Well usually we spend that on banelings but if we're being defensive we don't know if that investment is going to do anything, also we can make them quickly in an emergency so maybe we should do something else? So what I am suggesting is instead of banelings after the baneling nest just go straight to lair. We can get a head start on tech, while remaining safe (the gas we pool during the lair can be for those emergency banelings). Straight after lair we slap down a hydra den and 2 or 3 more gases (whatever you feel more comfortable with) and then afterwards double evolution chambers for upgrades, and if necessary get roaches. Going straight hydra speed sounds good to pick off overlords but its less important because almost every single zerg unit is faster than the hydralisk. So what I do is go range first then speed, this means in the worst case scenario where my roaches are late and they're attacking me I can tank with lings and shoot from a distance with hydra to hold.






                                                                                                                                       
TL;DR: normal 15/16 hatch 15/16 pool 16/17 gas @100 gas speed @ 50 gas banelings @ 100 gas lair @ 100% lair hydralisk den @ 60/70% hydra den 2/3 more gases. @ 3 gases 100% double evolution chamber @ 100 hydra den get range upgrade. If you would like roaches get it @ 50% hydra den maybe more. When you have around 6 or 7 hydras and some lings then you may take your third, unless you don't feel comfortable taking it. If he goes mutas just get a spore or two at each base and camp your third with hydras and lings. If there is a ling run by, and it gets in, and you don't scout it fast enough to defend with your lings, then you deserve the losses you get.
                                                                                                        
If he goes mass baneling to kill your hydras then that's where roaches can come in to play to tank for the hydras. However if you're not feeling the roach you can burrow your hydras after spreading them OR you can do what I do, and take the gas to make around 10 banelings, to completely deflect theirs. In such a hectic battle they probably won't be able to micro the banelings so they don't die to yours.
All this talking may help but some of you may not learn that way, so I would like to share some replays of this gameplay. Not only so you can learn but so you can see it isn't just someone saying, ""hey do this it will work"". You will have confirmation. These replays are from the new season so they are masters players, just in diamond at the moment.

I am a Platinum WoL player, but I played a few games right when I got a key and I tried some weird plays that lost to quick all-ins so I got placed in Bronze.
Now that I'm playing again, I'm undefeated as zerg and I'm having a lot of fun. I tend to open up with roaches and burrow all-in vs toss (to get my rank back up), but now and then I'll decide to FE to 3 base and play roach/hydra/swarm host.

It seems like most SC2 players on reddit dislike swarm hosts and I don't seem to understand why. I really enjoy using 8-12 of them to apply continuous pressure to an opponent's expansions. Something I absolutely hated as a zerg player was being contained on 2 bases by siege tanks, but swarm hosts give zerg that same mechanic. Knowing how devastating a zerg player can be with unchecked expansions and macro, containing an opponent from a zerg's point of view seems to be of extreme value.

Some of my favourite HOTS games are one where I contain another zerg player with 8 swarm hosts and expand madly.

But I want to hear exactly why people aren't finding swarm hosts useful. If you've had experience with unsuccessful swarm host play, tell me what you did and what your opponent did. What went wrong?

EDIT:

Thanks everyone for contributing, it seems like the consensus is that swarm hosts are too expensive to get the 8+ that are required early enough for them to actually be useful, especially with the large map sizes in HOTS.
The comments also touch on how the Hydralisk is a necessary and unavoidable support unit for the SH, and has upgrades that are expensive and necessary.

I've played roughly 80 Zerg games and a total of about 250 games overall. I've recently been having a lot of trouble vs, first of all bio play. In my last game, this Terran player (gold, I was silver but that doesn't matter) was on 3 bases and he had 140'ish supply. He had about 50 workers or something and I had around 70 and 4 bases + a macro hatch at my main and I had 200 supply, my army consisting of some Roaches, Zerglings and Broodlords/Corruptors vs MMM. I tried to fight him but I kept on losing. I immediately try to rebuild my army as it dwindles and still lose fight after fight.   

  Also, in my ZvZ I find that I'm always a little bit behind my opponent and his tech timing. Usually I'll have my Lair researching right as his is at 80 or so % and that leads to a faster spire and inevitably my demise because I just have Roaches/Lings. Also, I find it difficult holding my natural with waves of Zerglings storming at me. I try to go for a Baneling nest to try and erase some of those little devils but my control is so bad OR they just whiz past them and go straight to my main or whatever is further away from my Banelings so I'm sitting there going ""Shit shit shit, my drones!"" And after dealing with that, it feels like I've expended all my resources defending and I'd think it made us even cause of how much he made but as we go on it feels like he got his army for free while droning.  

  Oh and if I might add, I understand Infestors are such a strong unit but.. well, much like my last game, ZvT, I'd have 10 or so Infestors and.. well, I'd go in for a fight, I do send my Roaches and what not in first and then I send an Infestor to fungal.. (1) and as that fungal drops, so does every single one of my Infestors ;~; is there some kind of trick to Infestor control? Am I meant to queue up a move command back behind my army after I fungal or do I just click Infestors individually to get them to fungal? lol sorry I probably sound like someone who's played 2 games of Starcraft but yeah, those are things I feel I really need help with. No matter how much I bank, I just can't make the right composition in a ZvT and in ZvZ I have trouble keeping up with my opponent.

I've switched from protoss a while now, and am generally feeling pretty comfortable in all my matchups except for TvZ, which seems to be ironic since most of the community feels like that's zerg's best matchup right now. I can handle bio terran for the most part, but I still struggle against mech play, and typically the only way I win is by doing run bys when I see his army move out or attack early before it deathballs into a juggernaut of thors/tanks/vikings/hellions

In my last game, I had him contained to three bases on Newkirk, while I got up to 4 then 5. I saw that the was going mech fairly early, concentrating on thors and tanks, so I decide to go for broods as fast as possible while still getting upgrades for roaches. (I had the economy and my macro wasn't the greatest). So I get a few broods and start to engage, then he brings out a wall of vikings and kills the broodlords easily, and my roaches melt. I remax a few times, but I still feel like I wouldn't know how to act since I don't know what the objectives are for zergs against mech.

Do I want to be trying to get all corruptors/broodlords by the end? Corruptors for everything in the air, broodlords for everything that's on the ground? I'm never really sure. Also, I'm not sure if infestors have a place in this army or not? It seems they're pretty limited against tanks, unless you can burrow them under sieged tanks.

I do a 15 pool then expand asap, takes my gas as soon as the probe is gone/dead (didn't work too well in that game), put 4 lings to guard the third so he can't scoot I'm not taking it. I position 2 overloards near his wall. With first 100 gas go lair. With next 100 gas go speed.

I made the jump into the top 5 a few weeks ago and was super excited but also worried. What if I lose a game!?! I'll drop like ten places!. That never happened and I got over it. Worked my way up to 4th and fluctuated between 2nd-4th for a week before making a big jump and suddenly finding myself 1st today. Granted I only had like 25 some wins compared to 40-50+ of others I had a 100+ point lead compared to the second guy and everyone else below. Was I really first? Hell I'll probably drop down again when I lose! After some tense games against Aggressive Terrans, a bunker rush that I defended and some close ZvZ's I got it done. Playing people twice my league and sometimes plats over the past week has been interesting and fun. I go from thinking I'd never get promoted or even getting close to the top 10 to staying in the top 5 for most of the season and eventually getting 1st before making the jump

So all in all tonight has been a great night. I've finally met my objective of getting promoted, improving and getting over my negative attitude. I haven't spent a lot of time on ATZ but the content on here has really helped me out. I'm still in the lower leagues but I'm fine with that. Seeing progress is great especially with mechanics.

Brief background:
Started playing SC like 2 years ago, got into plat a year ago, but then I took a looooong break, anyways,

my friend who is also in plat has been winning a lot on ladder (p) by proxy starport vs t, 5 immortal timing vs z, and hates pvp.

anyways, i dont want him to get into diamond before me so i started laddering hardcore, anyways ive looked at liquidpedia for all-ins, etc and im looking for the currently most effective pressures, all-ins, cheeses, etc. to ladder quickly. 

my current repertoire when i dont play my macro style is,

(vs zerg)
- 15 gas 15 pool 
- 2 base baneling/speedling
- Ling flood

 (vs terran)
- 1 base baneling bust
- 2 base baneling bust/speedling

(vs protoss)
- stephano, roach style
- baneling bust

any suggestions are much appreciated :)

Cure opened with 3 reapers and about 4 Hellions into Hellbat drops [2 at a time], which put Zenio behind [about 30 workers killed].  
  
Note: Zenio had 5 total Queens on 3 hatcheries against the drops to kill medivacs/defend against hellions in the front.  
  
Cure then went Bio/Tank/Medivac and lost a trade to Zenio's Mutalisk/Roach/Speedling/Baneling army and good micro.  
  
After gaining the lead, Zenio peppered in some Swarm hosts, started range upgrades, teched to hive, and got Ultralisks, which sustained his lead, and eventually won with Ultralisks, Vipers, Swarm Hosts, Infestors, Banelings, Speedlings, and Mutalisks.  
  
Biggest note: Cure only built tanks, no widow mines. Zenio also had a really cool strategy of using the mid/late game swarm hosts to hold off pushes from Cure while doing a TON of zergling run-by's, which did a lot of damage.
  
Result: Zerg WIN

Game 2 - 8th CHECK [z] vs Liquid HERO [p] on Whirlwind

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz-RX_Ao2_I

Macro game

Standard opener from Check, Hero starts Gateway first. Hero moves out with 2 stalkers and a MC, which forces a lot of zerglings from Check before zergling speed is finished and puts Hero ahead economically.

Hero builds several Phoenixes off of 1 stargate and gets some drone kills, a queen kill, and about 5 overlords giving him a much better economic advantage.

Check techs into Hydralisks on 3 bases, builds up about 14 with ~30 speedlings, and moves out to try and deny Hero's 3rd base. Check builds a Spire behind this. Hero has since tech'd into Colossus, and with some great force-fields holds the attack, denies the 4th base, and pushes into Check's 3rd.

Check builds 14 mutalisks, but Hero has built 2 additional stargates and pumps phoenixes and kills all of the mutalisks, Check gg's shortly after.

Notes: No drone scout from Check on a huge map doesn't let him see the gateway expand, so his gas is late, which allows Hero's stalker harass to do a lot more damage than it should have. Further harass and poor micro from Check gives Hero too much of an advantage for Check to recover from.

Result: Zerg LOSS

That being said though, I haven't played Zerg since WoL. Even then it was only low dia level.


I haven't really played SC actively since the start of HotS, at that time I was playing Terran.

I'm not entirely sure how to get into playing Zerg.
I know that they are mostly based around timing, and not so much B.O

However, whenever I come back from a break I always find replay packs and ""try"" to use my notes to write my own builds down. Which I can't really do with Z as much.


So what I guess I'm looking for is this:

- How do I open for each M.U?  (and what is the reasoning)
              Such as 15p 16 gas, etc.

- What should my early, mid and lategame comp. consist of primarily (open question, I know)

- What am I scouting for?

- Anything I should look out for? (lost to a lot of gateway pushes back in the day..)

- Any ""meta"" I should know? (like how ZvZ was pretty much muta vs. muta for a little while, etc.)

- Anything else that you think would help.


If anyone could answer some or all of those questions that would be widely appreciated.

Also any other help about the race/game as a whole would be appreciated, thank you :)

I'm wanting to share this and see what ya'll think.


This style basically comes alive at the beginning of the mid-game.  You do what you can to take little to no damage to early pressure from the protoss.  I get to three bases asap, once mostly on the way to saturation, I start getting gases as early as I feel it is safe to do so.  If the toss goes for air, then I build a bunch of spores and drones while moving my ovies over the building spores.   Once I get my lair I start building the spire.  


From here it's pretty basic.

**if they went stargate then you need to get corrupters as well as your mutas.  

**Start taking extra bases every chance you get.  This is the crux of the style is getting up to 10+ geysers.  

**You need to be managing your control so that you are keeping the protoss back in their base and not expanding.  Keeping them in their base gives you the map control to mass expand and keep taking more geysers, giving you a constantly maxed muta army, potentially with corrupters if the toss has kept up with phoenix production.



The main things that this seems to be weak against are:
  
**lots of warp-ins/run-bys to your satellite gas bases

**army-wise HT's with storm and archons can whittle down your mutas pretty well, but that's why you are getting so many bases/gasses is to be able to absorb those losses and maintain a maxed army.

As mentioned, I'm pretty lousy at ZvP.  


There seems to be so many things that I can be hit with (timings, allins etc), that it pretty much just scares me into a defensive macro game every time, and in the end, I just wind up losing to a standard push anyway!


I seem to have a pretty solid mental block as to what to do.  To the point where I choke, and end up doing nothing at all, banking a ton, and producing nothing useful, and getting supply blocked like nothing else...


If ever I try to do early aggression, I feel that Protoss can pretty much shut me down 100% of the time with forcefields.  Granted, my early aggression plays are pretty poor anyway, but there just seems to be nothing I can do to break the wall of a Protoss early game.


I'm currently Diamond on EU, though I'm not convinced I belong there.  I left my league about a month ago, as I was getting my ass kicked, but I've been put back there today.  I've been doing well today, but we'll see if that continues.


I'm 28, with a full time job, so I only actually manage to play maybe 3-4 hours a night 2-3 nights a week, if I'm lucky.  Because of this, my intricate game knowledge isn't great.

I've attached some replays (I hope I've done it right,  haha) for review.

I'll happily provide more info below if needed!

http://drop.sc/334336
This one, I overcommit to killing some colossi and immortals, and lose due to just having no army left.  What can I have done differently?
Apparently this is the 'famed' 2 immortal 2 colossi build of the moment, which is freaking hard to hold.


http://drop.sc/334334
This game I try some aggression and get shut down hard.  After that I just flounder because I have no idea what my follow up should be after failed aggression like this.  I feel I'm so far behind there's nothing I can really do to catch up.


http://drop.sc/334335
This game I actually thought I'd won, until I lost.  I'm also fairly poor at closing out matches- I'm so fearful of attacking into defensive positions, that I just tend to dance around a lot...

I'm only in gold and I've been working on my macro to get up to 3 bases but I feel like my opening is hurting me a bit.  

My issue is, often I do not drone scout.  When I do I feel like I usually get there too late and they are walled off, or otherwise, I get there too early to understand what is going on yet - I'm not good at recognizing gas timings.  Regardless, I do consistently get an overlord in the base at 6:30 - 7:00 and that usually hints enough at what they're doing. 

My issue is I like to have a plan when I go into a game and for ZvT, it usually involves ling/bling/muta (that's just what I did in WoL and I'm a creature of habit).  So I'll get into the game, usually 15h, 16p, 16g and then go from there.  I'll spend my first 100 gas on Ling speed, and I'll often get a baneling nest and get level 1 melee and carapace after I've got 2 bases going pretty well.  

The issue is, at this point I feel like I've made so much of an investment in the ling/bling tech path that once I see them going mech at around ~7 minutes with my OV, I don't know what to do.  Do I abandon ling/bling and go roach/hydra, etc? I feel like this results in late roach speed and then I'm also behind on upgrades for roaches cause I've already leveled melee attack at that point. 

Just curious what the best course of action is.  Try to be fancy with ling/bling that I've invested in and maybe just try to get ultras quick and thus stay on the upgrade path or do I abandon my early tech decisions and go with ranged units and count the early money spent as a loss?

 I stumbled upon two pretty useful resources to use for getting your build orders nailed down. I used to resort to having a notepad on my desk, but this is way easier.
 
* Part A) Monkey Bot arcade game - starcraft://map/1/203387

This is a build order tester with a really great 'restart' feature, far better than loading in and out of custom games vs the AI or whatever.


* Part B) - SC2 Scrapbook
http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=287794

This is an app that creates an overlay on your screen with your build order. I think it'd be pretty lame to use this in competitive games, but I don't see the harm in using it for convenience of practice / memorization. Of course you should gradually transition into doing it without the list.

One caveat, you need to use the 'windowed' fullscreen mode for this to work properly.


Cheers, hopefully these can help some of you like they helped me.

The visual explanation is here: http://i.imgur.com/FtLK2pN.jpg but from the posts, this is what one does (in layman language).

=== MorroW's notes ===

How widow mine works

they lock onto a target. first one who enter within 5 range OR best unit (which is basically the closest unit to the widow mine)
once they lock into a target it begins channeling for 1.5 seconds (ingame)

If the unit leaves the 5 range, dies or player manually switches target during the channeling period - the widow mine repeats the process.

so this is why mines sometimes dont attack, sometimes kill terran and sometimes kill zerg.

so lets say you run in with zerglings against marines and a widow mine. the widow mine locks onto the first zergling who enters.

if the zergling dies to marines, it changes target and has to wait another 1.5 sek, if that ling dies to marines it changes target etc. so it appears not to be attacking at all.

if the zergling runs past the widow mine, behind the marines for example it switches target as well (the target has to be within 5 range the entire lockdown process)

=== As a Zerg Player ===

as zerg
as a zerg player, you know that your first zerglings will be targetted, so use your frontal line in move command behind the terran army and attack with the rest of your zerglings normally. if you do this just right (and terran doesnt) the mines will all fire on your lings that are behind his bio army and kill everything he got.

=== The Math behind it =====

I am new to this subreddit and to the game itself so please don't be harsh on me :) Also, I hope that this post won't make any trouble for you guys.

Backstory (for interested): I own SC2 since release. I played some ranked matches with friends back then but it wasn't something serious or whatever you would like to call it... I just wasn't really interested in that type of thing. Sometimes I launched SC2, but I was playing only Arcade maps. Some of you might know that RTS genre is kind of dead at the moment. Everything is about Total War series and nothing more. I became a little bored and RTS ""hungry"", so I decided to play SC2 more often. So here I am, back again in SC2, playing some ladder games.

------
So... This cute matchmaker placed me in the silver 1v1 league. I am the Zerg player (EU server) and I have some problems as a newb. Well, maybe the newb is a bad word. I tried myself earlier in this game, also I am very familliar with SC/SC2 (races, units, skills, upgrades, etc.) so it is not THAT bad. The biggest problem for me is maintaining the eco. Either I have a lot of everything but it is too late to make an army or I have almost nothing, with pretty decent army, yet other people still manage to outnumber me. I know that the practice is the big factor here, yet I understand almost everything and I still do pretty bad in 1v1.

I think that the problem lies in the Drones. It really hurts that I have to ""sacrifice"" one to build something. Generally I see this as putting myself behind the enemy and destroying my own eco. It is something that my mind cannot comprehend it on it's own.

I can't find any help on the internet. I mean, a lot of youtube videos are outdated, a lot of them don't explain anything or are just plain stupid. I am looking for some kind of couching-style videos, so if any of you know this types of videos, I would be really grateful for links. I watched Apollo's REVAMPED Tutorials and they were great, but it would be nice if I had something else to watch.

I know I can do better. I played lots of 2v2 games with my friend (who is as skilled as me) this season and we are placed against platinium/diamond players. I just don't know how to rely on myself in 1v1 battles.

I hope I will recive some tips from you guys.

Thanks for your time and help in advance.

Heart of the Swarm is the Zerg expansion, yet so far it is the weakest race of the three.

Don't think i mean it's impossible to win with Zerg against Terran or Protoss, because it definitely can be done. The problem is that, pound for pound, T and P have received the better new units and abilities. What have we Zergs gained?

First off, I'd like to apologize if you've seen this before. I'm new to reddit, but no matter where I looked I couldn't see my post from anywhere on this subreddit, not even under new, not even when I logged out. So if it was visible, I apologize for the repost

I'd like to question the traditional use of evolution chambers in the matchups we play against Terran and Protoss today. I feel that carapace upgrades are next to useless, and it would be more efficient to focus on upgrading missile and melee attacks instead.

Let's look at the numbers, by matchup.

ZvT: 


Against a bio style, there can be no doubt that melee/carapace is a must. The fast attacks of small damage that marines do make it necessary to upgrade carapace to be cost efficient in engagements.

Against mech, carapace upgrades have no place in my opinion. Hear me out: A standard mech player will open hellion/banshee -&gt; third base -&gt; double armory -&gt; double factory -&gt; a few more facts later on. The fast upgrades they get are enough to keep up/give you no upgrade advantage. The only time that carapace upgrades make a critical difference against mech is if you have +1 carapace and they have +0 vehicle weapons, which will never happen (or at least not for very long) if they do a standard MMA/MVP-style hellion/banshee double armory opening. Also, both missile and melee upgrades greatly benefit the anti-mech army's DPS. Missile upgrades obviously benefit roaches as well as infested terrans, and melee upgrades help broodlings/ultras/lings. I recommend skipping carapace upgrades if you're playing against a meching player.

ZvP:
Carapace upgrades aren't worthless in this matchup, however you'll never be able to fight zealots cost efficiently with zerglings until you have 3/3 and the Adrenal Glands upgrade. You will never catch up to a Protoss in upgrades because of chronoboost and forge openers. If stalkers have a ground weapons level that is 2 greater than your ground carapace upgrade, stalkers kill Zerglings in 1 less shot. The biggest benefit of carapace upgrades in this matchup is to get +2 by the time that Protoss does his 3/3/3 (3 colossi, 3 base, +3 ground weapons) push. That way stalkers get shredded by Zerglings, but I think that stronger roaches/IT make up for the weaker Zerglings.

I'd like to have somewhat of a discussion on carapace upgrades in these matchups, if I missed anything, etc. Do you guys agree? Disagree?

I'm curious where you place your opening pool.

Watching the dApollo early tutorials, he always placed behind the mineral line. So I started off doing that. Then I saw some Day9 video where he used the pool to create a choke for his queen (in ZvZ) by placing it next to the hatchery, which seemed clever.

Currently my pool placement is race-specific.

ZvP: behind the minerals.

ZvT: next to a geyser (don't want to create easy pockets for him to drop in and use my pool as a choke point).

ZvZ: unsure... Can place it next to hatch to aid in defense, but this risks getting sniped if he does an aggressive spine crawler. After losing to that once, I went back to behind the minerals.

Trivial distinctions in the grand scheme, I realize. But pool placement comes at a time when there's little else to concentrate on, so might as well optimize it as much as possible. What do you all think?

They like the different races having different perks.

I get this.

But what was behind the design decision to have such lackluster AA options for Zerg when compared to other races?

Before you tell me Zerg has queens, corruptors, and infestors, you know what I mean.

When you play against Zerg, it feels 'safer' to make air units early on. This isn't true with vT and vP. Marines and Stalkers are available very early on, and they do not lose efficacy as an AA option as the game goes on.

Hydra, on the other hand, have many limitations that makes it a rather horrible choice as your main answer to air threats.

Corruptors are outranged by vikings and out-dps'd by void rays.

Infestors are about the only proper AA. Fungals and infested terrans ARE amazing.

Infestors are a must-have in any Zerg army, so maybe that's why there isn't much hurry or a need to change this issue of disappointing choices AA options.

But I'm still perplexed as to why this design in the first place? I'm certain Blizzard didn't mean to have infestors be solely viable AA option for Zerg.

I'm Quonzar, a member of team exioN. Last season, I was a 1760 point masters zerg player, and in the new season I've gotten 800 points so far :D.

Tomorrow, myself, along with a few of my teammates, will be putting on a stream through SCVRush.com that will focus on the zerg side of the ZvT matchup. We will be analyzing replays from myself and some other team members, in the hopes to show our thought process in a way that you can apply it to your own gameplay, and become a better player :D

The stream will be from 1:30-3:30 pst, or 4:30-6:30 est. The first portion of the stream will focus on replay analysis, and in the later half, we will choose one member from the chat to do a small coaching session with live. There will be zerg and terran players present, to get full feedback on the do's and don'ts of ZvT.

Also, if you'd like to have a chance at getting your replay analyzed live on stream, you can link the replay in this thread (preferably ZvT replay :D) and we may give constructive feedback!

For further coaching, you can go to SCVRush.com for a list of a variety of coaches for all races! You can view the stream when it's live (15 hours from post) through www.scvrush.com, or twitch.tv/scvrush1 Hope you tune in!

The integrated wiki is basically what it sounds like, a wiki specifically tied into allthingszerg.  If you aren't familiar with a wiki, it is a collection of pages that all contain information (like an encyclopedia) that can be edited by anyone!

Right now allthingszerg constantly has posts that go over build orders, the metagame, player information, stream information, and other information that is scattered about usually found in comments or self posts.  When you are trying to find an answer to a question, you are left using the (poor) reddit search, or by making a self post.  This isn't very fast, reliable, or accurate.

I am hoping that we can use the wiki to collect information so that you can easily and quickly find the answer to questions like ""who is daisuki"" or ""how do I beat the immortal sentry allin""

*(Please remember all information we know about HotS can/will change. All discussion of HotS strategy is also just theory-crafting.)*



**CURRENT ZERG HOTS CHANGES**

*New Units*

* **Viper** - 100m/200g (3 supply/40 seconds build) - 3 abilities :-

*1) Consume* - damages a friendly building for 200 damage over 10 seconds, restoring 50 energy

*2) Abduct* - pulls an enemy unit towards the viper (7 range) (can currently pull revealed cloaked/burrowed units)

*3) Blinding cloud* - Creates a cloud that reduces the attack range of biological units in the AoE to 1 (melee). Same AoE/range as fungal.


* **Swarm host** - 200m/100g (3 supply) - has a 3 second burrow (no research of burrow required to use), and spawns 2 locusts every 25 seconds

   :- *Locusts* - Last 15 seconds (25 seconds with 200m/200g upgrade). 2 range (can hit air/ground) and 16(!) damage
     
         
          
          
*Upgrades/changes to existing /Zerg units*

* Hydralisk Upgrade – Muscular Augmentation - (150m/150g) hydralisks move 50% faster off creep (Hydras will now move the same speed whether on creep or not)

* Ultralisk Burrow – Ultralisks come with this ability innately. 7 range, with a 1 second cast time. Units at the receiving end of the charge take normal damage and are knocked back.

* Overlord creep spread - Moved from a lair tech ability to evo chamber 

* Overseer - still in HotS, can now ""throw"" changelings for better immersion in an enemy army ( [tweet here](https://twitter.com/Kennigit/status/211186623935807489) )

* Ultralisk frenzy - apparently removed, Ultras can now be snared/mindcontroled/stunned

* ~~Baneling burrowed movement~~ Removed

 

*Cosmetic changes*

* New creep tumor spreading animation

* Creep is now much more pale on the minimap

* New queen model

* Slightly smaller Ultralisks, with apparent improved AI

* Burrow/Unburrow on different hotkeys


-------------------------------------------------------------------

So these are all the current changes for Zerg. Feel free to discuss anything related to zerg in HotS (although keep current balance discussion to a minimum)

FINALLY, after playing around for a bit, I decided to try a 12 gas/12 pool/get a queen/spine and some speedlings out quickly.

For once, when the enemy lings showed up, I was ready! Killed the 6 slow lings, killed the drones that he brought to build spines and slammed out more speedlings and counter attacked. I got to his base as his roach warren finished, popped his queen and killed all but one drone before he dropped, his 2 roaches still in egg form.

I am new to SC2 and have no clue what I'm doing or what my opponent is doing.

Below I will tell you my weaknesses with SC2 being so new and I would love any/all constructive criticism.

My normal build is
drone up,
send out overlord to their main to scout,
10 Overlord, 
11th drone scouts, 
15 hatch, 
15 spawning pool, 
15 gas, 
throw 3 on gas upon completion, 
wait for spawning pool and hatch to finish

As soon as spawning pool finishes I get 1 queen per each base. I build 2-6 lings and then drone and overlord up.

I usually try to scout early game with drone and overlord and my overlord normally dies to a queen, marine, or stalker. My drone either gets walled in or eventually comes back.

Then I never scout their base again. I try to send overlords to all of the possible expos across the map, prioritizing the ones near me to look for cheese. And I always try seeing when they take their expansions, and seeing if I should punish them with an army they cannot handle or if I should expand to stay 1 base ahead of them. 

I don't know what to do with my scouting information or even how to scout their main bases without dying to stalkers, marines, queens.

I just recently started leaving ~5 mutas near my bases to defend agaisnt drops in PvT and thats been amazing.

Any time I go econ, they rush me with a massive army I cannot defend.
Any time I go army, I attack them, and they have the econ to defend and then counter attack with a bigger army. 

I have no clue what to do when my opp walls in.

When I should go baneling nest, roach warren, lair? 
When should I get upgrades for any unit or evo chamber?

I always try to have ( n + 1 ) queens where n is the number of bases I have to larva inject and the extra queen to spread creep.

My queens always end at full energy cuz I'm bad.

I always have a shit ton of minerals and not enough gas.

I have no clue what kind of an army is good and normally amass a bunch of 1/1 zerglings or 2/2 lings with metabolic but not adrenal.

I dont know how to prepare for burrowed infestors, DTs, and terran stealth flyers. I normally try to have an overseer at each base and sometimes the AA turret with no army behind. 

I try to get a ground army and a bunch of mutas and send them in on different flanks forcing his army to split up and or choose incorrectly.

I never build any unit thats not drone, overlord, roach, hydra, ultra, and I rarely get any upgrade all game besides metabolic for lings.

I am really bad and would love help and suggestions with any/all of the above. Also I would love coaching from a highbie!

Thank you so much.

tl;dr - I suck and I'm good at whining

I will be attempting to stream for at least six hours, which for me will be difficult, seeing as I've never even laddered for more than four hours in a row: www.twitch.tv/quonzar

For those of you who don't know me (the vast majority), I am Quonzar, a high masters zerg on the American server. A link to my sc2ranks profile can be found here:
http://www.sc2ranks.com/character/us/2327554/Quonzar/hots/1v1

The reason that I will be attempting for stream for so long is to try and promote my new coaching service. I have been coaching many players for quite some time now of varying skill levels, from bronze-silver all the way up to masters. I have done so free of charge, driven by the enjoyment of helping others.

However, the dedication of students with free coaching can be somewhat disappointing. With payed coaching, students are more invested in the service, and take it more seriously. Often times I've coached for free, only to have the player stop playing altogether a week later. With charging for coaching, I am aiming to help those serious about improving do so.

I will be charging 10 US dollars/hour. For any of those interested, you may tune into my stream, and if you would like coaching, email me at quonzarsc2@gmail.com or pm me here on reddit!.

If you aren't interested in coaching, hopefully you will tune into the stream anyways, as I will commentate all of my play and hopefully teach through my stream! ^.^

Take out production and econ, maybe grab a third and transition into 1/1 roach hydra, slowly going for infestor tech.  You still have a nydus network if you haven't outright killed him, so while you turtle up on spore defense, you can perform counter attacks with your otherwise immobile army.

I know the most important part for a zerg is his injects, creep spread and decission making and scouting. Please feel free to leave any tips or replays that will help me.

So my question is simple - when should I start with the upgrades and when is it acceptable to throw down 2 evo chambers and not one? Is there a certain timing to it or purely reaction based or what? 

On a side note, I'm also confused about macro hatcheries, when should they be thrown down?

I'm a roach-hydra kinda guy in all match-ups. I've been going for this build since HoTS and was a toss player before that. I like it and it's what I'm used to in terms of micro (a-moving with some casters).

I want to change to more of a ling-based play. I tried it when I first switched, to not much success. It's the reason why I wanted to switch and it seems much more exciting. I have a general understanding of the theory behind the play, but need help.

So my questions pretty much go as follows:

* How many to keep off to the side for run-bys and counterattacks?
* Is it advised to keep lings to the side in engagements to be able to get behind (I see a few pros do it, but sentries deal with that well, and I'm afraid of my front forcing melting before my back-up squad does any damage in their attempted surround)?
* Since you're making a lot of cheap units, macro hatcheries? How many and when?",,False,,t5_2tkq6,False,,,True,t3_1dws74,http://www.reddit.com/r/allthingszerg/comments/1dws74/help_me_change_playstyles/,

I am talking about a composition of tanks, thors, hellions, hellbats, and mines.

Mutas work to an extent, but well placed mines and once there are 4-5 thors it becomes very difficult.

Roaches don't really work either due to all the tank splash. Lings don't work at all.

I'm a diamond Terran player from over at /r/AllThingsTerran, and I have been trying to fill holes in my play lately. One of the more stand out problems has been dealing with early heavy aggression and all-ins. Things like bling and roach attacks have been doing more damage than I should be letting them, or killing me outright.

So what I am looking for is a list of common zerg all-ins and maybe some vods/replays of them being executed so I can break them down and identify some of their ""tells"" and figure out what adjustments I need to make to hold them better. 

I have tried to replicate stuff my opponents have done, but that is like a copy of a copy. My zerg mechanics are nowhere near up to par to hit the right timings and my opponents are probably making a mistake or two as well. It would just be more efficient for me to try and draw from well executed examples than fight uphill through my opponent and I's faults.
