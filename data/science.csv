This is one of the kinds of guys who thinks that RFID implants are the ""Mark of the Devil"" and that things like hip hop and LGBT people are ""destroying our society.""

Recently, I got involved in the debates on his page, and my friend and I have tried giving honest, non-incendiary responses to the tired, overused arguments, and a number of the evangelist's friends have begun supporting him in his arguments. We've had to deal with claims such as ""theories are just ideas created by bored scientists,"" etc. Yes, I realize that this is, in many ways, a lost cause, but I'm a sucker for a good debate.

Despite all of their absolutely crazy beliefs, though, I wasn't as offended and upset until recently, when they began resorting to anti-intellectualism to try to tear us down. One young woman asked us ""Do you have any Grey Poupon?"" despite the both of us being fairly casual, laid back types. We're being accused of using ""big words"" to create arguments that don't mean anything to make them look stupid, yet, looking back on my word choices, I've used nothing at above a 10th grade reading level. ""Inherent"" and ""intellectual"" are quite literally as advanced as the vocabulary gets.

Despite how dangerous and negative a force religion can be in the world, I think anti-intellectualism is far worse, as it can be used so surprisingly effectively to undermine people's points, even in the light of calm, rational, well-reasoned arguments.

When I hear people make claims like that, I always think of Idiocracy, where they keep accusing Luke Wilson's character of ""talking like a fag.""",,False,,t5_mouw,True,,,True,t3_bj6do,http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/bj6do/antiintellectualism_is_to_me_one_of_the_most/,

AMA!",okaysteve13,9205,6356,1299,http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1jd5ji/im_mit_neuroscientist_steve_ramirez_inceptor_of/,"EDIT: You all have been a combination of inspring, insightful, inception-driven redditors. On a scale of 0 to Thai food, thank you so much for the dialogue and I'll be back tomorrow morning to answer some burning questions. Feel free to keep the convo going but here's a summary of some of the most commonly asked questions: 

1) How do I get into grad school? 
A: It's not all a numbers game -- do as much research as you can for the experience in a lab, contact professors early to express interest and possibly meet with them to see if you're a good fit, and really personalize your personal statements for each department. 

2) What are you doing next with this technology? 
A: To continue my quest in making science feel more like a friendship-filled hobby and less like a job by asking the questions that really can excite and benefit a community. Next on my plate is neuropsychiatric disorders and how to alleviate certain symptoms by tinkering with any associated memories.

3) How do I find the right lab to work in? 
A: It's like a relationship: There are three planets that need to align for grad school to be a success -- you have to love the person you're with (the lab head), you have to love the kind of research you do (spending quality time with the person, let's keep it PG for now :P), and you have to love the people in the lab (the significant other's friends). So many people are willing to sacrifice one of these and, in doing so, the entire edifice goes kaboom. Don't settle for anything less than all of the above, and never do it for just the money. It's that feeling of discovering something no one else in history has ever seen that money itself can never buy. 

Buenas nachos team! 

EDIT: Back on back! First off, holy guacamole thank you all for the comments, questions, and dialogue. I'll get to as many questions right meow as possible to continue our AMA full speed ahead. Amazing. Almost as amazing as the guacamole and turkey burger I had for dinner. Can you say nom? Oh, and my hands are reattached!

EDIT: My hands fell off a few posts ago, so I need to go grab some quick noms and recharge my dexterity battery -- leave your questions at the beep and I'll get to as many as I can later on tonight. Also, please keep the dialogue going amongst yourselves too! Science discussions in the open are fascinating, insightful, and what the field is all about. Huzzah! BEEP. 

Hello reddits! After seeing how much the r/science community discussed the findings and impliciations of our lab's paper last week, we felt that an AMA was in store to answer your questions about the paper, the experiments, the social/ethical ramifications of memory manipulation, grad school, life at MIT, how to incept memories in the brain... chocolate stouts, my roommate's cat, El Salvador, and all things brain science.

To quickly answer some of the most common questions we've come across:  

1) Yes, we did control experiments. #forscience

B) No, the military/NSA/CIA/OMG aren't doing this to humans. (OR ARE THEY???) 

4) We can all agree that the media sensationalizes, sensationally &gt;_&lt;

Hi r/science!

We have some pretty exciting news to share with you. As many of you know, we're always looking for new ways to make this subreddit more dynamic and engaging for our readers. One of these efforts have been to form a bridge between those that write the articles you read and the comments present within our thread. Today we are announcing a relationship with National Geographic and 11 of its writers and editors to participate in National Geographic related content submitted - by you- in our threads. 

In the interest of full transparency, and to offset any worries you might have, r/science will continue to be 100% user-generated content. National Geographic will not be given any special privileges with regards to submitted content, and thus will not be allowed to submit any stories under these usernames. Their goal is simply to discuss science topics they love as much as you do. In fact, u/Mackinstyle [Mod] summed it up best in our chat, stating: *""It's just important that we preserve the democratic process in which reddit operates. But we are thrilled to have you guys keeping an eye out and sharing your expertise and insight to help steer the comments in a positive direction.""*

However you may be wondering, why now and why National Geographic? The simple answer is that we've never come across a publisher as interested and motivated to participate in r/science conversations before. We were first approached by u/melodykramer (Writer) on June 19th, saying that *""there are often really great questions and discussions [in r/science] where I think having a first author and/or person who studies this stuff would help...we'd like to see if there's any way we can enhance the experience for /science readers and/or see if there's anything we should/shouldn't be doing.""*. From there we began entertaining the feasibility of this relationship and how to make this work. Having a flaired username, stating their credentials, will ensure that the answers to your questions are coming from someone with an vetted background in the subject. It will also give you guys an opportunity to ask about how science is written in the media and to explore details of a published experiment not explicitly stated in a NatGeo article.  

With that said, we welcome any questions or concerns you may have about this. Again, this relationship, currently, is entirely comment-driven, and will not include any special permissions when it comes to National Geographic submissions. 

Finally, many of these users will be commenting below, so feel free to welcome them and ask as many questions as you like.

&gt; Geneva, 30 March 2010. Beams collided at 7 TeV in the LHC at 13:06 CEST, marking the start of the LHC research programme. Particle physicists around the world are looking forward to a potentially rich harvest of new physics as the LHC begins its first long run at an energy three and a half times higher than previously achieved at a particle accelerator.

&gt; “It’s a great day to be a particle physicist,” said CERN1 Director General Rolf Heuer. “A lot of people have waited a long time for this moment, but their patience and dedication is starting to pay dividends.”
