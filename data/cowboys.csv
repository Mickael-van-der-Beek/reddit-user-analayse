1366987053.0,96,self.cowboys,1d5lvh,Ok Cowboys fans. Back away from the ledge and let me tell you why Travis Frederick is a solid pick. (x-post from /r/nfl,daytonamike,124,28,95,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1d5lvh/ok_cowboys_fans_back_away_from_the_ledge_and_let/,"I have a theory that Dallas is about to switch to the no-huddle offense as their base offense in 2013. Considering how successful Dallas was while in the no-huddle in 2012, this is a great move. My theory is based on 2 parts. 1) Jerry commenting that he wants Romo more involved in the offense. How is that possible other than going to the no-huddle? 2) Dallas not willing to disclose their playcaller for 2013. Because its going to be Romo. Frederick is a great pick if my theory is correct that Dallas is about to run the no-huddle as their base offense in 2013. You need a smart center to pull that off. Jim Kelly had Kent Hull. Peyton Manning had Jeff Saturday. Neither Hull nor Saturday were amazing Centers, but both were incredibly smart. Hull was a 3-time Pro Bowler, Saturday went 6 times. If this theory is correct, they couldn't chance missing on the smartest Center in the draft when their entire offense is about to be dependent on having a smart Center. Travis Frederick has been in college for 3 years and has already double majored in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. He was the smartest Center and the best Center, all in 1 guy. Dallas has started a new habit of drafting the best player at a position in the draft and they have been successful with this logic so far. Now, I don't mean the best player available when they draft. I mean the #1 of a position on their board when they draft. We saw it last year with Claiborne. They made a move for the #1 CB. The year before, they were able to sit at 9 and get the best OT in Tyron Smith. The year before Smith, they moved up 2 spots to get their #1 WR on their board, Dez Bryant. This new strategy is working. They aren't just taking the #5 OT on their board, which is what would have happened if they went OT in Round 1. They took the #1 Center on their board. Have a little faith. This isn't Jerry Jones running the show anymore. The reigns are firmly in the hands of Stephen Jones and Jason Garrett. They've proven in the last 3 years that they are drafting very well. Just give it a little time. The first time Dallas goes no-huddle in the 1st Quarter of a game, remember this post and realize Dallas NEEDED Travis Frederick. Even if you think they could have gotten him later, you don't take that chance if he is they key to a new strategy. Relax. Breath. Enjoy Round 2/3 and our now 3 picks.",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,,True,t3_1d5lvh,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1d5lvh/ok_cowboys_fans_back_away_from_the_ledge_and_let/,

All the players were sitting around looking like dejected shit. Garrett should've put his offensive players and coaches in a huddle and discussing the next 2 plays. Maybe he thought he'd get a TV timeout after the kick, but even I know that shit doesn't happen with less than 1 minute.

Worse, he didn't have 2 plays called. This may be up for debate, but Romo was screaming to the sideline, Dez came back to the huddle (as if that was the situation for a huddle), and even the o-line was standing around. Maybe we have the single dubest and laziest team in history, but I doubt even they are that dumb and lazy. I really think they didn't run back because there wasn't a second play called. There was no rushed mindset. 

They had one play, then field goal. Terrible.

And this is what Garrett has to say about him
&gt;We liked him coming out of school. He’s a smart guy. We think he’s a good athlete. We think he has good instincts playing the safety position. That’s why we drafted him. Then, from the limited number of practices we’ve had with him, he’s demonstrated those things. It doesn’t seem too big for him. He seems to be able to pick things up and play well in the limited action that he’s had. So we felt like, it’s a long season. Over the course of 16 weeks, a lot of different things happen, a lot of different injuries happen. You’ve got to be able to absorb those things. So we felt confident with what we’ve seen so far. So hopefully we can get him back and get him going.

He didn't play this season because he was struggling with hamstring and back injuries, but hopefully he was able watch and learn the game all the same.  I hope he's been hitting the weightroom and will be ready to get back out there in stellar shape for next season.  

Maybe he'll continue to look promising in practice, and maybe he can be a contributing factor in our new defense, he sure seems to fit in well.  

Maybe he'll save us an early draft pic that we can use on another lineman instead of an early round safety.

Romo is a leader, the leader the cowboys truly need. But as a leader you are only as strong as your team, and that team let him down. The defense was terrible, our run defense was miserable and it was all season long. Most of the teams who beat the Cowboys this year have a fairly strong run game (i.e Sea, Was, Chi, Bal). This added with the fact that the cowboys run game is poor, due to Murray and the oline unable to provide a consistent run game. This put so much more pressure on Romo, forcing him to throw more, and have to make throws outside the pocket, usually rolling out with rushers hot on his trail. Because they became almost one dimensional it eliminated a lot of the playbook. No run game lowers the effectiveness of the play action, which would allow receivers to get the crucial break that separated them from the defender. It also allows the defense to blitz more of a pass stopping rush instead of a run blitz. Thus forcing Romo out of the pocket. As a result the defense can play more pass protect defense. That creates more interceptions because your receivers are easier to cover. So as a result this puts an insane amount of pressure on Romo. He wins/loses games. Not the cowboys lost, its always Romo did this Romo did that and that is why the cowboys lost. 
As human beings we tend to look for the one person to point a finger at to blame for something. Whether it be Jerry, Garret or Romo, we as fans feel the need to blame someone. Its true with any team, look at the Jets, or the Chargers. Its always someones fault. But its a team sport and that team all makes decisions on what to do and what would be the best possible mode of action. Does Romo make bad choices, of course he does. But as a Cowboy fan, I will stand behind him as a leader who will be with the cowboys through thick and thin. And when he wins that Superbowl, if he does, it will be so much sweeter to have risen up through all the trials and sadness to be champion. The cowboys have let so many of us down, but our time will come soon. And when that time comes the victory will be so sweet that people will show up by the bandwagon truckload. And you can truly say with pride that you are a true blue cowboys fan.

1367156225.0,43,self.cowboys,1d9reu,General musings after some 40 years as a fan,mushpuppy,60,17,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1d9reu/general_musings_after_some_40_years_as_a_fan/,"After many years I've finally realized this isn't the Cowboys team I grew up idolizing.  The first game I actually remember was [this one](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197212230sfo.htm).  Staubach came in at the end, after missing most of the season with a shoulder injury, and pulled out the first of his many legendary miracles.  The next week the Cowboys were blown out 26-3.  :p  

Anyhow, for years before that, and many after, the Cowboys symbolized, at the very least, professionalism and competence in their leadership.  They haven't symbolized that again, of course, since Johnson left.  Which isn't to say that Jones isn't a brilliant businessman, but no sports fans support teams because their owners are good at brand-building.

As I've mentioned before, Garrett really is my last hope for the Cowboys to be good again in my lifetime.  He's got what it takes intellectually, and I don't mind the mistakes as he learns.  I just want to see improvement.  So if Jones actually does stick by him and surrenders to his intelligence and football competence, they have a chance.

Most of the fans who complain about him, I think, maybe actually didn't play football past, say, junior high.  I played in college, and I can say that, based on my experience, how he handles team-building and the media is precisely how a good coach would behave.  *Praise publicly, critique privately.*  I'm not sure I first learned that on a football team, but it's certainly an approach to leadership I admire, practice, and support.

The problem is of course Jerry.  People talk about Stephen like he's going to be better--and he might.  But I haven't seen anything suggesting either way.

Anyhow, if Jones fires Garrett, I think I finally might be able to cut the cord.  I look around at the teams that do symbolize the values I admire in life--the Steelers, Giants, Ravens, Packers.  Some of those teams have ridden the cycle of success that the NFL generates--but at least they've been on it.  Other teams, like the Raiders, Cowboys of late, Chiefs, and so on, fell off and never got back on--because of the quality of their leadership (or lack thereof).

I wouldn't want to follow a team because of the personality of a coach or player--those things change.  But a system or approach I could appreciate.

Or maybe really at my age it just might be time to let the NFL go.  I can't say it's made my life any better being a fan.  It's been much more enjoyable and rewarding to be a fan of my wife, my children, my friends.  That it would take a lifetime to overcome the brainwashing of propaganda speaks to the strength of societal forces.

We really do only have a limited time in which to accomplish our lives.  I know, when we're young we think we have forever.  We think nothing of days spent like [this one](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/177229).  But as the clock ticks, as we grow up, accomplish, and age, we realize inevitably the transience and brevity of existence.

As youths, we accrue things to care about.  Often because friends/society have told us that we should care.  But as we age, we begin to push those away which we find irrelevant or, often, which don't live up to our standards.

So we'll see what happens this year.  The Cowboys almost certainly won't be Super Bowl champs.  Honestly, if they even make the playoffs I'll be amazed, as the second half of their schedule looks hard.

But under Garrett they have grown from a lackadaisical team demonstrating the complete lack of effort they showed in that [Packers game](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201011070gnb.htm), which resulted in Phillips' firing, to, last year, a scrappy, *interesting* team, which, despite its mistakes, never once gave up trying or grew dull.  

As that pretty much describes every person of note, for now they seem to be a team worth following.  If Jones just can resist his mercurial impulses to interfere, they could be developing into something.

In life, character, will, effort all matter.  In a way, Garrett is conducting an experiment to see if the same things can change the course of an NFL team.",,False,,t5_2re7g,1367159412.0,,team cowboys,True,t3_1d9reu,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1d9reu/general_musings_after_some_40_years_as_a_fan/,

I think helped to create a lot of depth and competition on the roster while also bringing in 2-3 players that start playing significant time in year one.  The Terrance Willams pick is easily one of the best picks in the entire draft.  [Seriously.  Watch his NFL.com scouting video](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2013/tracker/by-round#dt-by-round-input:3).

Travis Frederick - Center - Wisconsin

[Pre-draft Interview](http://www.dallascowboys.com/multimedia/videos/Pre-Draft-Interview-Travis-Frederick/2e3094ac-0d5f-404a-ae4a-b183de34ff9b)

[Collection of Highlights (At bottom of article)](http://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2013/4/26/4268550/dallas-cowboys-draft-profile-travis-frederick-now-the-center-of-attention)

A native of Sharon Wisconsin, Travis Frederick is an extremely intelligent player. He's graduated early... twice. From high school as well as from University of Wisconsin, the latter with a degree in engineering.

Frederick became the first offensive lineman in Badgers history to start as a true freshman in 2009 when he played center against Northern Illinois.  After redshirting in 2010 he started the majority of 13 games at guard as a ""sophomore"" in 2011.  For two games, he had to substitute for Peter Konz at center.  Following Konz' departure for the 2012 NFL Draft, Frederick was moved to center his junior season. He started all 13 games at center and was named an All-American by Pro Football Weekly.

Frederick is listed at 6' 4"" and 312lbs.  He was called the [""best run blocker coming into the draft""](http://www.profootballcentral.com/2013/04/22/wisconsin-center-travis-frederick-scouting-report/) by some.
Frederick was considered the top prospect at his position not only for his obvious football IQ but also because almost no one in the nation has had a stronger lower body than Frederick. [Frederick broke the school record at Wisconsin by posting a 770-pound squat.](http://www.muscleprodigy.com/the-top-10-strongest-college-football-players-arcl-1753.html) In addition, Fredrick’s upper body is almost as equally strong; he can bench around 500 pounds. 

Fredrick steps right into the mix at the position which was almost unarguably the weakest on the Cowboys roster last year.  At a position where consistency is the key to a smooth and productive offense the Cowboys started 3 different players and all lacked the ability to provide protection for Romo or holes for the Dallas RBs.  All signs point to Fredrick becoming an instant day 1 starter and giving the Dallas offense long term stability at a key position. 

Gavin Escobar - Tight End - San Diego State

[Interview at the Scouting Combine](http://www.miamidolphins.com/media/videos/2013-Combine-TE-Gavin-Escobar/af1b97e6-2368-49d7-85bf-c6f588aefce7)

[Combine Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRJVgm_BaMA)

[Game Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZAK-l_Bv0Q) 

Escobar was born in New York City and moved to California as a child.  Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, his only scholarship offer came from San Diego State.  Once at San Diego State he tallied 122 receptions for 1,646 yards and 17 touchdowns. He earned all-conference honours all three seasons during his career, including consecutive first team honours in his final two seasons.

Measured at 6' 6"" and 254lbs Escobar has the size teams covet in tight ends.  Escobar is well known for his excellent hands and ball skills. Mike Mayock says ""Maybe the best ball skills of any of them. This kid's got great ball skills. He's a gifted hands catcher. He will be a great short and intermediate catcher for the Dallas Cowboys.""  Those skills are on display all throughout his highlight video but especially [@ 2:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mZAK-l_Bv0Q#t=136s).  Escobar has also shown signs of being a dominant physical presence after he gets the ball in his hands.  You can see that [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=mZAK-l_Bv0Q#t=55s).

Dallas continues to give the offense more dynamic weapons with this 2nd round choice.  There is a feeling that Escobar will be especially useful in goalline situations as his height, physicality, and excellent hands will give him an advantage over most NFL DBs.  The Cowboys will work Escobar into the lineup where it is most advantageous for them while still relying on the all time great Jason Witten.  Escobar comes into the perfect situation where he is surrounded by other dynamic playmakers and can study under the tight end that just set the NFL record for catches in a season.

Terrance Williams - Wide Receiver - Baylor

[Combine Interview](http://collegesportsblog.dallasnews.com/2013/02/video-terrance-williams-interviewed-at-the-nfl-combine.html/)

[Game/Combine highlights](http://www.nfl.com/draft/2013/tracker/by-round#dt-by-round-input:3)  (Same video as before...but couldn't you watch highlights of this kid all day?

[More highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=DwcgqQ2g9ns)

Terrance Williams is home grown and attended W. T. White High School in Dallas, Texas. As a senior he had 59 receptions for 972 yards and eight touchdowns. Considered a two-star recruit by Rivals.com, he accepted a scholarship to Baylor.  

At Baylor he earned honorable mention notice from Big 12 coaches as a junior by gaining nearly 1,000 yards (957) and scoring 11 times in his 59 receptions.  In addition to his receiving numbers that year (43-484, 4 TD), Williams was also the teams leading kickoff returner (21.4-yard average). It was the second straight year he led the team in that category, as he took over the reins for the final two months of his redshirt freshman season (768 yards, 24.1-yard average).  Even with the loss of RGIII Williams improved in every aspect during his senior season.  Williams led the country in receiving yards and earned first-team All-American honors and multiple other awards.

If while watching those highlights you were reminded of Dez Bryant you are not alone.  Williams is close to a physical clone of Bryant as both are 6' 2"" with Bryant being slightly heavier at 220lbs to 208lbs.  The coaches at Baylor took advantage of those similarities.  [“Back in college, when I was on scout team, I had to be him,” said Williams](http://sportsblogs.star-telegram.com/cowboys/2013/04/terrance-williams-eagers-to-learn-from-one-of-the-best-dez-bryant-who-he-used-to-be-on-scout-team.html), speaking of Bryant.  ""“That’s somebody that I really, really liked,” Williams said. “I’m going to get a chance to play beside him. That means the world to me because now I get to learn from one of the best and somebody that can help me throughout the whole process, bring out the best side of me.”

With the continued addition of dynamic weapons on offense Dallas has hoped to create an even more explosive offense that has the pieces to fit any situation.  Williams joins Bryant, Austin, Witten, Murray, Escobar, and the other young Dallas receivers as playmakers that give Romo &amp; Garret options.  The depth is further insurances against the injuries that affect every NFL season and continues to form an offense composed of young stars coming into their prime under the leadership of a veteran QB. 

J.J. Wilcox - Safety - Georgia Southern

[Pro Day Interview](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=UjRyfF55isU)

[Audio of his draft day call](http://www.dallascowboys.com/multimedia/videos/Secret-Audio-JJ-Wilcox/a99fb5c7-9bc6-4127-94c5-22316136eb21) 

[Video from inside his house during that call](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-Fgp23ndwE)

[Combine Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BClVXaOjRA)

[Game Highlights](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkPc_QikvRs)

Wilcox played for the Cairo High School football team that won the Georgia 2008 state championship. Coming into Georgia Southern as a First Team All Region and First Team All-Area wide receiver, he only played one season at wide receiver before switching to slotback as junior and then safety as a senior.

Wilcox has the physical tools and versatility to become an NFL caliber safety.  He stands at 6' 0"" and weighs 213lbs.  When watching Wilcox you immediately notice the physical presence he brings to the field.  He plays mean both near the line of scrimmage and deep down the field when contesting for the ball.  You can see the former wide receiver in him as it's obvious he sees the ball as something he wants and not just something you need to prevent the other team from having.  And once he gets the ball in his hands he runs with purpose.  Near the end of the game highlights video there are multiple clips of Wilcox getting the ball pitched to him in a RB role which again highlights how versatile and athletic this kid is.  

I would speculate that this is a Monte Kiffin pick.  Wilcox might not come in and win the starting job right away.  But he most certainly creates competition for the other young safetys on the roster.  Kiffin will get to breed competition within this group and see who rises to the occasion.  In any case Wilcox will also provide depth for injury insurance and I suspect will become very valuable on special teams right away.

However, I just got an email from [Tanga.com](http://tanga.com) and they are having their magazine sale for users.  You can get a year long subscription to ESPN magazine for $4 a year.

Not projects. I base my feelings of the draft on that.

I love the Escobar pick. Witten and Hanna combined for 3 TDs in 2012. You need more from your TEs. Escobar, at 6'6 is a great red zone target. Would we have liked to see a DLine or OLine pick here? Probably. But in the next 30 picks the only DL/OL players to get drafted were Hankins (3-4 NT so not a scheme fit), Margus Hunt (a guy who probably would have gotten lost on the depth chart for a year behind Ware/Spencer/Crawford), Larry Warford (who a lot of people like but Dallas needs more of an athlete at G), Bennie Logan (who I think Dallas liked but according to Broaddus Dallas had a 4th round grade on). So people can complain about reaches but when Dallas doesn't reach here, people are still bashing the pick.

I love... LOVE the Terrance Williams pick. ESPECIALLY given the injury concerns with Dez and Miles. 97 catches, 1832 yards, 18.9 yards per catch in 13 games. In the 3rd round?

As for the DLine, Ware, Ratliff, Hatcher, Spencer, last year's preseason stud Ben Bass, Josh Brent probably back at some point, Tyrone Crawford, reclamation project Brian Price (2010 #35 overall pick, only 24 years old), Sean Lissemore, and Dallas announced this weekend that Kyle Wilber has been instructed to bulk up for a move to DE. Jerry says the DLine is a strength, whatever. KIFFIN came out and said they are great on DLine, that I trust - especially with Marinelli running the DLine.

As for OLine, hopefully Clabo/Winston are in the works. Lines can get better with time but RT is scary. Running 2 TE sets having a TE chip on the right side can help greatly.

Overall, I loved what happened after R1. Could Dallas have gotten Frederick in R2? Probably. But probably not at 47.

Many needs filled. Some fans have mentally created needs (like DLine that if Kiffin says we're good, then we're good). I trust Kiffin. In the same interview (done early today) he said they needed help at LB. So he isn't just a ""everything is good"" guy.

Very happy right now.

It's as though Cowboys fans want to go back to the days of Quincy Carter and Vinny Testaverde and so on and so forth. Really the Cowboys are way better with Tony Romo than they will be once he is gone. But for the sake of argument, I compiled a list of QB performances against the Jets D last season/playoffs to compare to Romo. The fact of the matter is, Romo performed incredibly well with 2 big mistakes, with the interception arguably being Dez's fault, against what is an ELITE defense. Can't wait to eat up the 49ers next week. But here it is.

• The definite worst thing about that game for the Cowboys was turnovers. 6 turnovers. Wow...

•The quarterbacks never stepped up. The first half, it was terrible. Kyle Orton threw two interceptions. 

•Offensive line didn't do great. The run game was terrible.

The good things:

•Tony Romo played great. He didn't get a touchdown, which would of been helpful, but it wasn't his fault. Bryant and Dunbar fumbled on his drives.

•The defense-DAMN. They didn't give up one touchdown, only gave up 12 points. Too bad offense didn't get more than 12...

•While Bryant was in, he was playing very well (besides the fumble of course) 

After this VERY weird game, I don't really know what else to say besides our offense needs to improve. We had more then enough chances to come back after those turnovers, and no one stepped up. 

Feel free to comment what positives and negatives you got out of the game.

I know this is preseason, but I just take football really seriously.

The wager is as follows:

1) All comments in the losing team's subreddit must end with a nice comment about the winning team in italics. (Try to keep it ""clean"" as mods requested)

2) All member's of the losing subreddit must change their flair to the winning team's logo.

3) The losing subreddit must switch their header to the winning team's header

These will all last for one week, from the day after defeat (Monday) until the following Monday. Meaning that the next game day thread will be covered in the other team's shit.

Okay. Let's breathe. The draft is over and we can exhale. I know that most of us are upset with the reaches and picks but let remember who is the captain of our ship. Jerry Jones. What did you expect? Some picks we're genius (Williams and Holloman) and others were... interesting... (Escobar). Any way, I digress. 

The only thing we can do know is wait. If the figure heads are right and the players are of the right ""make-up"", then they need to go prove it. We're being fans right meow and overacting because we love our team so much. That's awesome and I've loved reading everyone react and debate about the picks and the beards (SAVE IT, BTW). But what's done is done. Let's wait it out and watch they new guys go out and compete.

We couldnt have passed him up. Our biggest problem last season was our offensive line, who did not know how to run block nor pass block. If Romo didnt have such good pocket presence he would have been the most sacked QB. Their run blocking was horrible too, which is what made Felix Jones look so bad. He and Murray had no holes to run through. But this pick will help a lot more then people think. The strength in our O-line was the left side(Smith at Left tackle and Livings at Left guard), while the right side and the Center position is what cost us the most. But with this pick, we have our Center position fixed and we can slide Phil Costa at Right Guard, which I think is a more fitting position for him. But then we still have the worst Right Tackle in the league, the overpaid Doug Free. He could not pass block to save his life and created so many costly penatlies. If we can replace him, our Offensive line will be much better than last season

By Tim MacMahon | ESPNDallas.com

Drew Pearson, a member of the Dallas Cowboys' Ring of Honor, is confident that the glory days are coming back for the franchise.

""Here's my prediction: The Cowboys will win the NFC, go to the Super Bowl and coming out of the AFC is going to be the Houston Texans,"" Pearson said during an appearance on ESPN Dallas 103.3 FM's ""Fitzsimmons and Durrett"" on Tuesday. ""And it's going to be an all-Texas Super Bowl in New Jersey -- in the winter, in the cold weather, in the snow and all that. Two dome teams, haven't played in the cold weather all season, and now they're going up to Jersey and play in the cold weather.

""And that's only if Houston makes it.""

The Texans, who went 12-4 last season and have won wild-card games in each of the last two years, could be a trendy preseason Super Bowl pick.

Pearson is really stepping out on a limb with his Cowboys prediction. Dallas hasn't qualified for the postseason the last three years and has a grand total of one playoff win in the last 16 seasons. The NFC has been represented in the Super Bowl by 12 teams since the Cowboys last made an appearance, when they won their fifth title in Super Bowl XXX.

""It's time, you know? It's time. They're due,"" said Pearson, an All-1970s receiver who played in three Super Bowls and won one. ""Everybody else has had a chance, let's let these guys have their opportunity.

""I think they've had just a few missing pieces on offense. Get a running game going, keep people healthy there, improvement in the offensive line. Romo passed for over 4,900 yards last season. It's just a matter of getting that ball in the end zone. I just think they have what it takes on offense, and then defensively [with] the improvements there, I think the Cowboys have made the most upgrades with this team as anybody in the NFC East.

""So I think they have a great shot.""",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,,True,t3_1hjhgo,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1hjhgo/drew_pearson_cowboys_will_return_to_glory/,

When Romo is running the no-huddle offense and therefore calling his own plays, he seems to do quite well and looks a more crisp with his passes.  When Garrett is calling plays, the team looks lost.  Perhaps they have lost confidence in their head coach, which as we've seen before can happen (ala Wade Phillips era).  
My personal opinion (and I know that doesn't really count as much) would be if Jerry is intent on leaving Garrett in charge than force him to hire an O-coordinator and someone to call the plays.  There have been several instances over the last season and a half of clock mismanagement from the sidelines because he's trying to do 2 jobs at once.  ""Oh, I forgot to call timeout because I was trying to figure out what play I wanted""  

Having the head coach doing another job is NOT working!  It didn't work when Wade was calling defense plays, and it doesn't work when Jason is calling offense plays.  Jimmy was successful because it brought coordinators to do their job so he could focus on being the head coach.

(Hope this was ok to post here... Just a little venting)",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,,True,t3_13t83b,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/13t83b/is_garrett_the_problem/,

Maybe initially I was, but can I honestly still be one? I don't think so.   
  
Anyways I was accidentally a bandwagon fan. I grew up with a family who loved the Niners for the most part. My brother was the lone Rams fan. I don't remember my dad trying to recruit me to be a Niners fan. I never was a Niners fan. My brother tried to recruit me as a Rams fan and I was for a very short period. I never paid attention to any games I just liked hanging out with him. He moved out (12 years older than me) and I started hanging out with my best friend more. He liked the Cowboys, naturally after they won 2 Super Bowls, so I became a Cowboys fan and it has stuck every since. I have been a Cowboys fan since I was 7 years old. It hasn't been easy, but I always watch, read, and talk Cowboys.

Maybe I was spoiled by 35 years of mostly success, so I never noticed them.  But I do not remember ever seeing a team play like this one.

Bryant at one moment can look like an ungainly stork snagging a fish and the next he can do an idiotic thing like not make the proper adjustment or just forget not to sling his arm out when he falls--thereby costing them the game.  Best WR on the team is the TE.  2nd and 1, 3rd and 1, 4th and 1, game on the line, 3 passes in a row.  A starting RB who isn't quick and doesn't know how to make a cut.  One of the greatest QBs statistically in the history of the league constantly belittled because his WRs are imbeciles.

I've just never seen anything like this.

Obviously Garrett lost all confidence in Jones; that's why he ran the ball--what, only 2x in the second half?

Only recommendations I could make to Garrett: 1) don't start Jones again; 2) let someone other than Bryant catch punts.

Recommendations for Jones: 1) for God's sake, set aside your ego and hire a GM who knows how to evaluate players; 2) no  matter what, don't let Ryan go; 3) institute a ticket rebate for fans who can prove they screamed the whole game.",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,team cowboys,True,t3_128vaz,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/128vaz/the_most_preposterous_team_ive_ever_seen/,

My passion for the Cowboys really drives me to extreme happiness throughout the week when they win, and it gets to the point of ""Don't talk to me"" if they lose, as i'm sure it's the same for you guys. 

Alright, to the point. I haven't been old enough to witness a Cowboys Super Bowl yet. I was around for some really horrid seasons, and a couple really nice, but dissapointing seasons aswell. My question to you ""older"" Cowboys fans, is how did it feel, when the Cowboys won the Super Bowl? I couldn't begin to comprehend, since I'm in the ""Cowboys haven't been relevant since the 90's"" arguements, and the ""Cowboys suck"" era. Oh well, it doesn't bother me because I know when the Cowboys do win the SB it will be just that much sweeter.

It would be cool for some of you to share your stories/bets/nostalgia. I hope i'll be able to do that soon.

And, as always, I have to end like this:

[Eagles](/r/eagles) @ [Bucs](/r/buccaneers) - **Eagles**.  Yeah, I know, but they're already ruined so now every win they get is *bad* for them.

[Bears](/r/chibears) @ [Vikings](/r/minnesotavikings) - **Bears** Whichever team doesn't win the NFC North between the Bears and Packers is pretty much guaranteed a wild card at this point, so we need the Bears to thin the herd for the 2nd wild card.

[Dolphins](/r/miamidolphins) @ [9ers](/r/49ers) - **Dolphins** - The NFC North is pretty much guaranteed 2 spots so the only way to get 2 teams in from the East is at the expense of the west.

[Cards](/r/azcardinals) @ [Seahawks](/r/seahawks) - **Cardinals** We *have* to finish a game better than the Seahawks to steal a WC spot from them.

[Saints](/r/saints) @ [Giants](/r/nygiants) - **Saints** We're going to have to beat the Saints ourselves if we want in so it's better that they bring the Giants back to the pack this week.

[Lions](/r/detroitlions) @ [Packers](/r/greenbaypackers) - **Lions** The only game we *might* need help from the Packers is week 17 against the Vikings, but that may not be necessary by then.  So if they want to lose out and miss the playoffs...

All my buddies had one and they all seemed to be exponentially happier than me.  I mean, all I had was the big grey clunky Game Boy and how in the world was that supposed to compete with the best gaming system in the world (sorry SEGA).  I knew exactly what games I would buy and subsequently begged my parents everyday for the ever elusive gaming machine.  

Right around this time Nintendo had come out with the 64 which I remember being prominently displayed at Best Buy with the help of a coalition of 9 TVs.  While a 3D Mario flying around on those TVs was pretty cool it could not distract me from my dreams.  The Super Nintendo was what I knew.  I had done hours of “research” and was very comfortable with what it had to offer.  While the 64 seemed great I didn’t know the games and the odds of me getting one seemed even more remote than me getting a Super Nintendo.

Then came my birthday.  I still remember my parents bringing down a suspicious package wrapped in my favorite material (the Sunday comics).  I knew exactly what was inside.  Years of pleading, years playing other’s systems, years of jealousy would finally be washed away in this magical moment.  

And when I opened my birthday present there, staring back at me, was a brand new Nintendo 64.

I was stunned.

It was so unexpected that if you watch the game tape of my birthday there is a good 60 seconds of me sitting like an idiot with my mouth open wearing a Darth Vader party hat.  Instead of the Super Nintendo that I had spent hours thinking about, hours desiring, and hours getting to know, I was presented with the best gaming system the world had ever seen (sorry Playstation).  The only problem was that my heart had become so set on the Super Nintendo that I didn’t appreciate the true value of what was in front of me.  

On April 26th the Dallas Cowboys drafted Morris Claiborne.  Just like on my birthday, I found myself sitting on the couch with my mouth hanging open like an idiot.  I was stunned.  Much like my anticipation for the Super Nintendo I had put all of my hope into the expectations that other’s had created.  David DeCastro, Mark Barron, and Fletcher Cox/Dontari Poe were all toted as the most likely characters to be drafted at the #14 spot.  They were the guys that I had come to know and fall in love with.  Andrew Luck, RGIII, Matt Kalil, and Morris Claiborne were like the 64.  They were mere pipe dreams that I hadn’t bothered to really even think about.  I knew they were good having seen them on the coalition of 9 TVs at Best Buy (okay not really) but tried to distance myself from them anyways because I knew the Cowboys would never get one of them.  So when the Cowboys did draft a top 5 prospect, I have to admit, I was little disappointed.  

I wasn’t disappointed because the Cowboys had given up too much (actually a great deal if you ask me), drafted a cornerback instead of another position, or taken mediocre talent, rather it came down to the expectations game.  I didn’t *know* Morris Claiborne.  I hadn’t anticipated his acquisition.  I hadn’t had time to fall in love with him.  At least, not yet.

I think that there’s something funny that happens with the NFL Draft.  Hours upon hours are spent analyzing players, making predictions, and knowing who needs to go where.  But then, less than 72 hours after the draft starts, it all becomes meaningless.  We are all disappointed and elated.  We all know the “for sure” players who our team missed and wait patiently until we can point it out to our friends 3 years from now.  We will all begrudgingly shuffle over to YouTube to watch the highlights of our late round picks who until several days ago we didn’t even know existed.  

Whether the players the Cowboys drafted were the Super Nintendo or the 64 of your world hopefully it wont matter.  Eventually our expectations will be changed and we will all become experts once the future is revealed.  The NFL is fickle in that today’s juggernauts become tomorrow’s bottom feeders and vice-versa.  For years the Cowboys have been in a weird funk that has left many of us frustrated.  The good news though, is that there seems to be a new era in Dallas.  JG seems to understand the big picture.  The Cowboys have gotten younger, high character has replaced over-priced divas, and the belief that wearing the star is an honor seems to have been restored.  Free agency and the draft saw specific types of talent picked.  Competition is back in Dallas.  I’ve become hopeful once again.

To my fellow Cowboys fans I look forward to sharing the new season with you.  Remember to enjoy yourself and represent the Cowboys respectfully.  It will be a fun year.

You are positively mentally handicapped. You built a stadium in Arlington and we were all buzzing about it, excited to be able to visit the Cowboys in one of the best and modern stadiums in the NFL. We all wanted to be there and cheer for the Cowboys, as homefield advantage should imply: a stadium full of rabid, screaming fans who are drunk off their ass.


But, we can't. Why? Because your god damn ticket prices are too high. Did you stop looking for a god damned naming deal for the stadium? Of course you did. You're too damned busy trying to film Papa John's commercials while you should be more concerned about managing the Cowboys. Relinquish your GM duties, or the commercials. I'd rather you forfeit the GM job, because you're rubbish. You're more concerned over housing lingerie shops in the stadium than you're about seating fans. I acknowledge the NFL is a business, but you don't even have to try to market the Cowboys. It's one of the few names in sports that is self-marketing.


So what do you do to the people that put you in the position to be the flagship of the NFL, your Dallas Cowboys fans? You've fucked them over, and you're wondering why you're drawing the ire of the fanbase. You obviously don't fucking care, and you won't fucking care ever. I don't remember a damn season in which I've been less interested in the Cowboys than this one. People are jumping ship and you're too blind to see that your actions are screwing you over too. Sooner or later, at least with you at the helm, we're doomed to stagnate in mediocrity, which means less revenue.

Jerry Jones, I like you as the owner. I lovingly titled /r/Cowboys as 'Crazy Jerry' because you are fucking nuts. I like your antics and your Jerryisms like ""Super Bowl Glory Hole"". That's an owner's job, which you are doing well. But you don't see you can't GM worth a damn, and fired the last guy who was actually competent at his job and gave you three rings.

Pull your head out of your ass. You're making this great franchise tank, and bringing all of us down with you.

Sincerely, 

An angry Cowboys fan.",,False,,t5_2re7g,1349220069.0,,Texas,True,t3_10udmd,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/10udmd/occupy_cowboys_stadium/,

1355358435.0,25,self.cowboys,14r8hd,A Rundown of the Tie-Breaking Scenarios for any Interested,goldberg1303,27,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/14r8hd/a_rundown_of_the_tiebreaking_scenarios_for_any/,"Inspired by [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/14qyum/nfl_week_1516clinching_scenarios/) on /r/nfl I started looking into tie breakers inside the division should it come to that.  

Now remember, all of the following is assuming the Cowboys, Redskins and Giants, or any combination of 2 of the three finish the season with even overall records.

First, a list of the first 4 tiebreakers though only the first 3 are relevant here.

1. Head-to-head (best won-lost-tied percentage in games between the clubs).
2. Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the division.
3. Best won-lost-tied percentage in common games.
4. Best won-lost-tied percentage in games played within the conference.

It makes me incredibly happy to announce that no matter what the Giants would lose the tie breaker with either Us or the Redskins.  A win against Philly in week 17 would give them just 3 division wins which both the 'Skins and 'Boys already have and with a final game against each other in week 17 one of them will finish with 4.  The Skins could potentially have 5 division wins with a game against Philly left as well.

With the Cowboys and Redskins it will come down to whoever wins week 17.  If the Redskins win they will have the head to head record and get in, game over, been nice knowin' ya.  If the Cowboys win it would be a split in head to head forcing it to come down to divisional.  A Cowboys win would give us 4 division wins.  If the Redskins lose to the Eagles in week 16 that would give us the edge at 4 wins to 3.  If they beat the Eagles then it would come down to Common games.

Now since we still each have 2 games to play that would count towards that record what I did is look at our incommon games, which have all been played.  There are two of those each, our respective NFC North and West opponents.  The good news for our Division Title hopes is we lost both of ours while Washington went 1-1.  Assume we both finish 9-7, this means our common opponents record would be 9-5 to their 8-6, we win.  The bad news is both of those losses for us were against the two teams currently ahead of us for the two Wild Card spots(Bears and Seahawks), meaning we would have to finish at least one game ahead of at least one of them to get in that way.  Basically for us to get a Wild Card spot the Bears or Seahawks need to lose out and we would still have to go 2-1 in the final 3 weeks.  And that's not even considering the other teams in the hunt though based on nfl.com's playoff picture we currently have the tie-breaker over the Vikings.

Again, that's all assuming a tied record with one of the opponents in question.  This is not a clenching scenario based on overall record.

Let me know if I wasn't clear enough on anything or made any mistakes.  

And I just have to point out again, the Giants are basically as desperate to win out as the rest of us if they want to win the division.",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,Illinois,True,t3_14r8hd,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/14r8hd/a_rundown_of_the_tiebreaking_scenarios_for_any/,

We've been promising it for a while now, and we think we've got everything working correctly, so it seemed like a good time to go live with it.  We hope you enjoy it.  We wanted to represent the Cowboys well, and have that reflected in the design.  Simple, conservative and a ""less-is-more"" approach were all things we were aiming for.

Please know up front, there are lot of features that other subs do that are great, but we just didn't think it worked for us.  We wanted everything to be purposeful and contribute to the community and conversation.

Special thanks to mushpuppy for constantly reviewing and offering a critical eye. Also, big thanks goes to the guys at r/redsox, r/49ers, r/nfl, and r/nygiants for their code, design help and assistance.

So here is what you need to know about flair.
We decided to go with states, being that the Cowboys have a diverse fan base.  It helps give context to comments and contributes to discussion.  For international fan there is a globe icon with a text field so you can enter your specific location.  Fans from Texas get a few more choices to distinguish their region / city.  Lastly, for our NFC East rivals there are NFC East team logos available.

Also, if you want to use a team logo in the comments section you will need to use this format.

Anyway, [**Tony Romo has the #2 all time NFL passer rating**](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_rating_career.htm) behind only Aaron Rodgers, and ahead of Favre, Young, Montana, Staubach, and Brady among others. Even though his 2011 season will come down to people remembering those awful INTs against the Lions, Jets and Giants, his TD/INT ratio was 3-1, behind only Brady (3.5 to 1) and Rodgers (whose ratio was nearly 5 to 1).

But his biggest self destruct is his big game performances, just like Danny White. Danny led the Cowboys to 3 straight NFC Championship games from 81-83. Most teams have gone a generation or more without even sniffing the playoffs, much less getting to a championship game. How'd you like to be a Falcons, Seahawks, Cardinals or Eagles fan? Birds don't win championships. 

The knock on Romo was also the knock on John Elway, 0-3 in Super Bowls in the 80s, 2-0 in the 90s. Elway was a stats machine who couldn't win the big game until he matured as a player, winning his first Super Bowl at age 37. Romo is 31, and he has the #2 career passer rating in NFL history, with a TD/INT ratio way better than both Aikman and Staubach could ever put together. Romo has the skills and ability to win a championship, he just has to get his head right with ball. Danny couldn't get his head right with ball and never could climb that mountain. Aikman climbed it 3 times &amp; Staubach climbed it twice (and lost twice, too).  Romo still waits at the foot of the mountain, but he's our guy until his skills deteriorate in another 6-7 yrs. Like it or not, all of Dallas' hopes to win another NFL championship rest square on that young man's shoulders, and that's where it belongs.",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,team cowboys,True,t3_of7wo,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/of7wo/why_the_cowboys_have_to_live_or_die_with_romoeven/,

[Original post and idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/15g49n/how_would_rcowboys_feel_about_a_cowboys_contest/)

- The contest will last one full day. I will open the contest in one last official thread and all submissions will take place in the comment section of that one thread. **Contest date will be April 14th from midnight and will close at 11:59 PM.**

- Winner is decided by the most upvotes.

- Anyone may enter the contest. 

- [Post a picture so Cowboys that it would make Tom Landry shed a tear.](http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/15g49n/how_would_rcowboys_feel_about_a_cowboys_contest/c7m7hy9)

- Added bonus will be [a runner up of the best trashing picture of a divisional rival](http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/170cyi/rcowboys_pizza_contest_rules_and_information/c818vlr).

- Reminder: I will buy you, the winner, one large pizza pie with up to two toppings. If you want it delivered, so be it, I will cover the delivery charge as well. I only ask that you, the winner, tip the driver or the pizzeria (if you pick up) at least 20% of the bill. A large pie would run you around $12 without the delivery charge. 20% of $12 is only $2.4, so please give the driver (if you're ordering delivery) more than that. I will message the winner within the next day or so to discuss when he/she would like to have the pizza ready. The winner will have three days to follow up with me or else the offer expires. 

- Runner up gets a large, one topping pizza pie. No delivery. Still would have to tip well. I would have no idea whether or not a good tip was received but I will trust you, the winner, to listen to my suggestion.

1.  The Cowboy have never played their best in September and October.  To say they play so-so is more accurate.  
2.  The Giants have start off every season 6-2 under Tom Coughlin.  Not sure how accurate that is, but I've seen it the last couple of years, I know.  

And the most incouraging fact I have for the Cowboys is: 

1.  Romo is 19-2 in November.

Every year it's the same patterns.  They lose a tough one to finish out October, and we all cry into our beer.  And then November comes around and WHAM!  They start winning again.  I'm right there with everyone else with a love/hate relationship with the Cowboys, but now, it's time to start loving again.

The remaining 12 games will determine the Cowboys season, not the first four, and especially not the last one.

All that aside, I'm so sick of reading the same tired anti-Romo anti-JerryJones memes anymore. For one, they don't change anything; Jerry Jones owns this team, get over it. Romo is the starting QB and gives the Cowboys a better chance to win than Garbage-Time (""Picking-apart-the-bears-3rd-stringers"") Hero Kyle Orton, despite the inane rubbish that ESPN and the local papers will spew in the effort to stir up some controversy and spin a dramatic narrative (which is all that they care about, not ""analysis"" or ""reality"").

Every time one of these games happens, it hurts. I haven't been a fan as long as some of you, but I love the Cowboys and desperately want to see them win week in and week out, and especially in January and February. I'm a big-time believer in Tony Romo: I love his style, I love his skill, I love his attitude and his work-ethic. 

Contrasting all the love I have for him, and all the great exciting games he's played the last 6 years, I hate having to endure the shit-storm that follows his bad games, like this one. For the next however-long-it-takes, I'll have to listen to the ""Cowboys can't win with Romo""s and the ""Tony Romo isn't a clutch quarterback""s and the ""Romo is a turnover machine""s.

And you know what the worst part about it is? After 6 years of unwavering faith, I'm now starting to doubt. 

What if all you negative hate-spewing assholes are right, that the Cowboys *will not* experience any postseason success with Romo at the helm? That's got to be the most depressing thought of all. That Romo will never shut you up forever when he hoists up the Lombardi. That 15 years from now I'll look back, fondly remember the good times I had and the joy and excitement I got from growing into a fan watching Tony Romo, and then have my mood turn sour when I think of how his time as the Cowboys QB comes to an ignominious, pathetic end (injury, benching, etc.).

As a true fan, I don't like to dwell in negatives. What's the point? I love watching this sport because I love this sport. I love watching this team because I love this team. It's pure joy to watch Tony Romo take the field at his own 20 and believe, and then see him orchestrate a 10-play, 80-yard TD drive. I would rather do that than sneer at the sight of him and declare to the fans I'm with that Romo will probably throw a pick-6 on his first attempt.

Because of this, I'm taking a break. I usually spend hours every week on r/nfl, on r/cowboys, on [BloggingTheBoys](http://www.bloggingtheboys.com), on all the other NFL-related contents sites I can find, soaking up info, reading about matchups, reading game-film reviews of the last week.

But I'm not going to do that this week, or next. It hurts too much to hear about how doomed the Cowboys are. Not because I believe these predictions are correct. I think they're wrong.

Any criticism is welcomed.


First we'd have to gather who in this sub would want to do it. I'm hoping we can at minimum get about 15 people to commit. 


Each week leading up to gameday, we (maybe the mods) can put in a post on the other teams subreddit stating we'd like to make a charity bet. The charities would have to be agree upon for each teams subreddit (including ours). 


The rules would be simple. However many points the team wins by, the losers have to pay that amount to the agreed upon charity. Obviously, some games might only be decided by 1-3 points or some other small amount, so we could make a minimum of $5 bet. Likewise, with games that may end up being a 30-40 point blowout. I, for one, am a broke college student who wouldn't be able to afford too many of those games, so we could make it a $20 max or something. In the event of a tie, both sides would make a $10 contribution. 



We could still do flair bets with other subs and all that fun stuff, but this is the only type of bet I would personally make.




If anyone is interested, please let me know. If not, I'll just continue to do the bets by myself. And any suggestions will also be much appreciated.

The Eagles - They played so, so bad. I can't believe they won. They didn't deserve it. The defense looked good, but my God... they had so many turnovers. Also, they got 4 interceptions and barely did anything with any of them. If they keep it up, they'll be 4th place in the NFC East.  

The Giants - They are the team that I'm worried about the most. Sure, we beat them, but we were lucky since Cruz dropped three crucial passes. If he catches them, I doubt we would have won.  

The Redskins - Oh boy... They have me worried as well. I doubt it has much to do with the Saints terrible offseason too. RGIII pretty much did exactly what I didn't want him to do: pass very well, run pretty well, and didn't commit any turnovers. If he keeps it up, I'm scared about our final game of the season.

## Tony Romo, Kyle Orton, Alex Tanney

Romo and Orton are a given, but I would like to see us keep a third in Tanney as he has impressed me thus far in camp.

***

### Running Backs (3)

##Demarco Murray, Lance Dunbar, Joseph Randle

With the move toward 12 personnel, we will have to cut down on the number of backs to make room for more TEs, so I don't think Phillip Tanner will make the list here.

***


### Tight Ends (4)

##Jason Witten, James Hanna, Gavin Escobar, Andre Smith

The first three are set, and I see Smith beating out Donte Rosario for the final spot.

***



### Wide Recievers (6)  

##Dez Bryant, Miles Austin, Terrance Williams, Dwayne Harris, Cole Beasley, Eric Rogers  

As much as I would love to put Danny Coale on this list, he just can't seem to stay healthy, and Eric Rogers is making a strong case for himself at camp. Still, I'm hoping to see Coale at least on the practice squad.

***

###Offensive Line (9)

## Tyron Smith, Nate Livings, Travis Frederick, Ronald Leary, Doug Free. Backups: Jermey Parnell, David Arkin, Phil Costa, Ryan Cook

I don't see Kowalski or Bernadeau making the cut here, they were both subpar before they got injured, and now that they aren't practicing, I see Arkin and Cook beating them out for back up roles.

***

###Defensive Ends (4)

## Demarcus Ware, Anthony Spencer, Kyle Wilber, George Selvie

This, along with defensive tackle will be a tricky position to sort out, especially with Crawford gone for the season. Ware has taken a personal liking to Wilber, constantly giving him one-on-one advice. George Selvie is a new, unproven addition, but with Cameron Sheffield getting injured I think he might beat him out. 

***

###Defensive Tackles (5)

##Jay Ratliff, Jason Hatcher, Ben Bass, Sean Lissemore, Nick Hayden

If Jay Ratliff can actually stay healthy (which is a big question to ask) I feel comfortable with this group, but just in case he can't, I bumped this number from 4 to 5.

***

###Linebackers (6)

## Sean Lee, Bruce Carter, Justin Durant, DeVonte Holloman, Brandon Magee, Ernie Sims

This is a hard group to evaluate without seeing any actual tackling, but the starters are clear with Lee, Carter, and Durant. The other three are just bold predictions.

***

###Cornerbacks (5)

## Brandon Carr, Morris Claiborne, Orlando Scandrick, Sterling Moore, BW Webb

There are clear standouts among the CBs at camp, and these 5 are them.

***

###Safety (5)

##Barry Church, Will Allen, Matt Johnson, JJ Wilcox, Jakar Hamilton

There comes a point when Danny McCray's special teams ability does not justify it's own roster spot, and I think that this year is it. I see Jakar Hamilton overtaking that 5th spot.

***

###Specialists (3)
##Dan Bailey, Chris Jones, LP Ladouceur

Pretty straight forward, barring some future horrible injury (Knock on wood).

Was that game just one of the best QB performances of the year? I'm not talking just about passing and play calling. I'm also talking in capability while under constant pressure. Both Romo and Big Ben were constantly pump faking, and dodging constant rushes that most QB's would have not done in those situations. It was not a ones sided QB show as we often see on Sunday games.

Every time I kept seeing Big Ben pump faking, and causing our DL to freeze, jump, and then they miss him while he spins had me jumping out of my skin. Ditto with Romo.

We got into LA and drove to Oxnard, making it in a little after practice got started. We will be here until Monday morning, after which we are headed home to watch the first preseason game from the comfort of my Dallas home.

First things first, we were extremely impressed with how well some of the younger receivers were playing today. Seriously, my thoughts about not signing Plaxico are much more reinforced at this point. We absolutely do not need to keep bringing in receivers on a one-year deal when we have SO much young raw talent that just needs a little time to develop (I'm not even talking more than a season here, we could very well see a good amount of Danny Coale this year).

Next, our defense is looking fantastic. Even without Claiborne in the mix right now, watching Brandon Carr line up next to Dez every single down, you can tell he is going to keep his side locked down for the most part, which is incredibly reassuring. Our linebackers are playing on a whole new level and they are really forcing plays in their favor. With the addition of Claiborne before the season opener and a little experience from the last three preseason games under his belt, we will be looking great in the secondary.

Our O-line is by far the biggest concern at this point, which isn't a surprise to anyone. However, knowing that we have a solid tackle on both ends (Smith and Free), and keeping in mind that we have several injuries on the inside of that line (all of which are short injuries which won't keep anyone out past the preseason), I feel slightly better after watching today. Romo was definitely getting more pressure than anyone would like, but remembering that most of these guys won't be starters is something to keep in mind.

DeMarco Murray and Felix Jones looked great, as did some of the younger backs out there making a case for their roster spots. There was a good amount of tension between the RB's/O-Line and the D-Line, which led to a scrap at one point that was broken up very quickly. However, it was shaken off so quickly that it left this wonderful feeling with me. I felt like I could tell the players were giving huge effort and playing passionately, but immediately shut that crap down when the coaches barked at them. It was a great moment and the fans off the field cheered.

Anyway, I'm attaching a few of my favorite shots (out of the 200 or so I took this afternoon) with a little description underneath any photo that I felt needed a brief explanation. I will definitely be taking more tomorrow and will likely add to this post. Enjoy, and feel free to ask anything and I, as well as [audrate](http://reddit.com/u/audrate) will try to answer it as best we can. Thanks!

**Day Two, Training Camp Thoughts**

So first off today, Romo was looking better than ever. He is making smart plays and he is really getting after players on the team who aren't performing. There was a moment during a brief scrimmage where his O-Line got called for a second false start, and he spiked the ball down and got in one guy's face, telling everyone to shape up. The entire audience cheered to see Romo acting like a leader and holding guys accountable for their play. His accuracy is as good as ever, and seeing his long-ball in person is even more impressive than it looks on film.

Dez Bryant is an absolutely unbelievable athlete. Seriously, this guy can make a play on pretty much any pass that comes his way. They were working him **very** hard today, so I'm hoping that his hamstring tightness is simply just some normal muscle soreness after going out for so many reps today. Going against every corner on the team, he was able to make plays and get to the ball.

As yesterday, Danny Coale and Cole Beasley looked outstanding. They are really going to shine during these preseason games, so you should look forward to seeing what these young guys are capable of. Also interesting, Dwayne Harris was taking **loads** of reps today, and was targeted quite a bit more than we saw yesterday. We also saw Raymond Radway making some great kick returns and getting some great blocks on special teams. Kevin Ogletree missed several catches that I would consider ""gimme catches."" His performance was fairly disappointing, and honestly if these younger guys are beating him at WR, I expect him to be cut before the season begins because he doesn't even play special teams.

Probably most impressive today, Bruce Carter is seriously earning a starting position on this team. Similar to Sean Lee's performance last year, it just feels like Carter always ends up being a part of the play in some way. Whether he's helping with a tackle, wrapping someone up alone, or making a pick six against Romo this afternoon, Bruce Carter *will be a starter this year* in my opinion.

1326593456.0,19,self.cowboys,ohhds,Some thoughts from a quiet Cowboys fan,bravecowboy86,23,4,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/ohhds/some_thoughts_from_a_quiet_cowboys_fan/,"In many ways this season was tough to watch.  Numerous 4th quarter losses and even the icing of our own kicker.  As painful as it was to watch I wasn't quite as bothered by it as others were.  In many respects, whether we want to believe it or not, the Cowboys are in a bit of a rebuilding stage.  The rebuilding process is how I came to view this last year; and the 8 wins I have to remind myself are actually progress over the 6 the year prior.  While it is easy to focus on the negatives (and Lord knows there are a lot) there were a lot of positives this season as well.  The Cowboys finally had some blow-out wins, wins against a very good 49ers team, and even some big wins against hot teams like the dolphins and redskins at the beginning of the season.  

I believe that the Cowboys biggest asset is also it's biggest hinderance: patience.  As a lifelong Cowboys fan growing up in the days of Aikman &amp; co. I have wanted to win the Superbowl every year and am frustrated when we don't (I have gotten much better over the years but simply remain a competitive person).  Jerry Jones seems to be of the same mindset which has come with its share of pros and cons.  I think the always winning mindset hurts the Cowboys when coaches and players aren't given a fair shake to succeed or when to much is given for overrated players to win in the ""now"".  On the other side, it *is* nice to have an owner that is not scared of spending money to get talent.  The success of course will come from spending the right money on the right talent which I feel the Cowboys are sooooo close to doing.

From what I've seen this season I believe that our offense is really not the problem.  The moves to improve our offensive line were all much needed and positive.  The O-Line is young but I believe will be beastly in 2-3 years (providing the Cowboys do add depth).  The receiving core has two big playmakers in Austin and Bryant and even Robinson has some potential (although it would be nice to see a pure speed wideout added).  Witten is a beast and the running game is nicely improved with Murray as a #1 and Jones as (IMO) a FANTASTIC complementary back.  It would be nice to see some depth at the RB position as injuries are so prevalent but I am not really that concerned.  I like Romo and think he gets too much of the blame as well as too much credit.  I am never opposed to acquiring young QB's but I don't think the QB position is something the Cowboys need.  In the end the Cowboys have a great offense with playmakers.  It would be nice to see O-Line and RB depth and maybe even a pure speedster at WR but at the end of the day I think the focus in the coming year(s) needs to be purely defensive.

I might be in the minority but I am **VERY** happy with Rob Ryan as our defensive coordinator.  I think he adds personality that the cowboys defense hasn't had for a while.  I hope Jerry doesn't get overzealous and let him go right away.  I would like to see Ryan go through a full offseason and let him have a little influence in drafting players that will mold to his system.  Given some time I think the Cowboys have the ability to become a dominant defense.  That said, what needs to be addressed in desperation is the secondary.  The cornerbacks are old and I dare you to name one of our safeties without looking them up.  The linebacking crew isn't quite so bad with Sean Lee stepping up but it would be nice to see at least one more beastly LB added preferably at the OLB spot.  The DL needs work as well as Ratliff can't do it all on his own.  At the end of the day there are pieces but a lot of holes as well and I would like to see the Cowboys draft almost exclusively defensive players in the upcoming draft.  

For the coming offseason here are some of my suggestions for free-agency and the draft:

For defensive free agency it would be nice to add a guy like Brent Grimes if we could lure him away from Atlanta or even Cortland Finnegan.  I think at the very least the Cowboys need to sign a solid number 2 corner like Brandon Carr or Tracy Porter to take at least a little pressure off.  I know it wont happen but it would be awesome to get a big safety like LeRon Landry to instantly turn the secondary around.  On the D-Line I would love to see Robert Mathis next to Ratliff.  Those two combined with Ware could more than help compensate for the lack of secondary.

Offensively for free agency it would great to get a guy like Ryan Grant who's stock is pretty low but still may have a good amount in the tank.  Even guys like Tolbert, Benson, or the Law firm could probably be obtained fairly cheaply but help give the Cowboys a solid ""pounder"" when needed.  As much as he annoys me, and as much of a ridiculous luxury as it would be, signing DeSean Jackson would make the receiving core straight up ridiculous (not to mention we'd have an AMAZING punt returner).  I mean just think about it.  The Cowboys would never leave shotgun three wide, with Witten at TE and Murray next to Romo.  It would be like the offense was powered by a GameShark.  Picking up a solid backup QB to replace Kitna (who I think is retiring) would be nice but not necessarily a big priority.  Other than depth I don't think the Cowboys really need to sign anyone on the OL.  They are young and will only get better with experience.

As for the Draft, my suggestions are based on the Cowboys not signing anyone (or of much significance).

For the first overall pick I would absolutely LOVE to have Dre Kirkpatrick fall to us.  I doubt he will but it would be nice.  I would also like to have David DeCastro fall but realize that's probably even more of a long shot.  In the end taking Nick Perry or Melvin Ingram seem the most logical to me although I would love to trade down.  Since the OLB is so deep It would be great to trade down instead and get two OLB like Lavonte David and Bobby Wagner, even Bruce Irvin would be nice as he appears to be an absolute beast (a bit unproven but a beast none the less).

The Second round I wouldn't mind drafting a second OLB if we took Ingram in the first otherwise I think this is where we should take Bobby Wagner if we took Perry earlier.  If we traded down like I think we should do we'd have two solid OLB and it would be a perfect time to grab Mark Barron if he falls otherwise I would honestly not hesitate to grab Markelle Martin early.

Third Round I would add more depth to the OL with high upside guys like Kevin Zeitler, Brandon Mosley, or Nate Potter.  

Fourth Round I think we could go in a number of ways.  I would love a guy like James-Michael Johnson to give even more depth to the LB core.  Would love for Harrison Smith to fall to us in the fourth to help address our safety issues.  If Mike Brewster falls I know it doesn't exactly fill our most needed positions but having another option at C wouldn't be all that bad.

I think Rounds 5-7 should be used to draft CB's.  I think the Cowboys should look for speed and smarts.  I know that's what everyone wants but I'm sick of getting burned by receivers.  With an upgraded pass rush through our new LB crew all we would need are corners to stick with guys long enough to knock the ball down.  An interesting wrinkle would be the drafting of a QB with upside like Kellen Moore, Case Keenum, or even Russell Wilson.

1369956424.0,19,self.cowboys,1fdbw1,"Had Dallas chosen Shariff Floyd at 18, the Cowboys would likely have not drafted a single offensive lineman in the first four rounds according to Dallas' leaked draft board.",Jackson3125,20,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1fdbw1/had_dallas_chosen_shariff_floyd_at_18_the_cowboys/,"[The Leaked 2013 Cowboys Draft Board](http://www.bloggingtheboys.com/2013/5/30/4378574/dallas-cowboys-2013-draft-board-leaked-almost-complete-7-round-board) indicates that the Cowboys would not have taken a single offensive lineman in the first four rounds had they selected Shariff Floyd at 18. 

There is plenty of support for both sides of the argument as to whether Travis Frederick would have been taken by pick 47. For the sake of analysis, however, this scenario is built on the assumption that Frederick would be gone by that point. I'll let you guys argue the merits of that assumption in the comments. At the very least, it's at least a very interesting what-if scenario. 

Let's examine how this hypothetical scenario would have played out: 

**1)** The Cowboys take defensive tackle Shariff Floyd at 18. 

**2)** Assumption: center Travis Frederick is taken before the Cowboys' pick at 47.  

**3)** The next highest rated offensive lineman on their board is Menelik Watson, who has a third round grade. In reality, he was picked at 42 by the Raiders, 5 spots earlier than the Cowboys pick at 47.

**4)** At this point, the only offensive linemen left on the Cowboy's board are graded no higher than the 4th round. Therefore, at pick 47, it is unlikely the Cowboys would reach two entire rounds on their board for an OL, and would likely still select tight end Gavin Escobar or perhaps another player.

**5)** Having not traded with San Francisco in this scenario, the Cowboys hold only the 80th pick in the 3rd round. It is unlikely that the Cowboys would reach an entire round for an OL (Note: although Travis Frederick was technically rated in the 2nd round, he was still the highest rated player overall on the Cowboys' board). Additionally, many of the 4th-round-grade OL have already been drafted at this point. Therefore, the Cowboys likely still select wide receiver Terrance Williams (if by chance he makes it to 80), safety J.J. Wilcox, or perhaps another player. If they do decide to reach for offensive line help, center Khaled Holmes is the highest rated OL on their board with a high 4th round grade.  

**6)** In the 4th round and armed with pick 114, Dallas once again faces a situation where the highest rated OL on their board has no higher than a 5th round pick. Assuming once again that Dallas would not reach an entire round for an OL, the Cowboys likely still select cornerback B.W. Webb or perhaps another player.  If they do decide to reach for offensive line help, tackle Rick Wagner is the highest rate OL on their board with a mid 5th round grade. 

*For reference, the OL on Dallas' board with 4th round grades were taken as follows: 

 - Brian Winters - pick 72 (before Dallas' 3rd round pick)
 - Dallas Thomas - pick 77 (before Dallas' 3rd round pick)
 - Khaled Holmes - pick 107 (before Dallas' 4th round pick)
 - David Bakhtiari - pick 109 (before Dallas' 4th round pick)

_____________

Consequently, had the Cowboys taken Shariff Floyd at 18, and making the (perhaps bold, perhaps not so bold) assumption that Travis Frederick would have been selected before pick 47, the Cowboys would have either not taken an offensive lineman in the first four rounds, or would have reached an entire round for OL help in rounds 3 or 4 at the earliest. 

So, /r/Cowboys, which of the following drafts would you have rather had? 

**Frederick Reality**

1) OC Travis Frederick

2) TE Gavin Escobar

3) WR Terrance Williams 

3) SS J.J. Wilcox 

4) CB B.W. Webb

**Floyd-at-18 scenario**

1) DT Shariff Floyd 

2) TE Gavin Escobar

3) SS J.J. Wilcox or OC Khaled Holmes (the highest rated OL, ranked a 4th rounder)

4) CB BW. Webb or OT Ricky Wagner (the highest rated OL, ranked a 5th rounder)

Look at a defense that has been decimated by injuries but yet able to keep us close in games to even allow us a chance to win some of the games we did.  It was not perfect ball but the difference between a starter and back up is huge let alone an unsigned player walking the streets not even thinking about starting!  We have some major holes on the D line to shore up next year be it FA or draft but we need some bulk to slow down the run!




I am dishearten with the play of Romo as much as the next guy but this is a team sport and although his last turn over at a crucial time hurt the final nail in the coffin was the horrible penalty by Hatcher with 2:39 left to go that would have only allowed a FG and maybe a chance for game winning drive.  I am not trying to defend Romo by any stretch and I am sure the first INT cost us a few points and a moral boost but the Skins def blitz and the lack of taking advantage of a wide open middle hurt.  He made some pretty bad calls but after 3 quarters if our Offensive coordinator (Garret) can’t make any adjustments to take advantage of this how can we expect Romo to have a decent look down the field for a receiver?  I fully believe Garret either needs to go or we need an offensive coordinator that can concentrate 100% on what the opposing team’s defense is doing  so he can make better plans on how to attack it the next series.




Getting rid of Romo is not the answer, he is one of the main reason we had a chance to win the division in the first place.  Choke or not it is a hump that even Elway took 15 years to get over to win his first Super Bowl and honestly that is what everyone wants not just getting to the playoffs although we have gone 3 times in 7 years with Romo.   We have a solid core of a team with lots of talent that, in my opinion, is not being pushed to its fullest and that lies on the coach alone.




This is going to be a long off season as have been the last few years but the heartache will go away slowly but surely for us all True Cowboys fans and we will be here next year rooting, yelling, screaming and enjoying our Cowboys once again!

Our first round selection from this past draft. As most of you may have gathered, I am a **huge** fan of Tony Romo. I know many of you guys are fans of his too, and I know that we have a minority who dislike Romo. Despite the reputation Romo holds for being a ""choke artist,"" and being unable to perform against pressure, I strongly believe that the offensive line will be the best it has been since 2009, when we won our only playoff game. 

Travis Frederick and Tyron Smith are the only real locks we have on the line. Personally, I think the other three men protecting Romo will be Phil Costa, Nate Livings/David Arkin, and Doug Free/Jeremy Parnell. Phil Costa was a bad center, but a good guard. Doug Free will hopefully return to the form that earned him his massive contract. I really think if these guys give Romo at least a few seconds in the pocket, stay healthy, and do not commit dumb penalties, we **will** win the NFC East. 

Of course, all of these thoughts are premature, but they're my premature-and realistic-thoughts.

I just want to get your opinions.  Lets just say 'hypothetically' that he didn't restructure (and they made cap room some other way).  Let's say that Romo had a spectacular year this year and hit the market next year.  Would he still receive the same or similar amount of money from some other team?

Or lets say he was a free agent now.  Would he receive the same type of contract from any other team?  

I personally think there are at least 10 other teams that would be clamoring for his style of QB play and what he could bring to their franchise.  If he was a free agent now, many teams would have offered him the same (if not better) type of contract. 

This is not a debate about whether or not he deserves it.  Its just a question of if you think he would have gotten a similar deal with any other team? ",,False,,t5_2re7g,False,,Texas,True,t3_1bn1m6,http://www.reddit.com/r/cowboys/comments/1bn1m6/romo_haters_gonna_hate_but/,

This is the thread where we come up with rules together. Any member of /r/cowboys may participate and I invite you all to help me figure out how to make this contest as fair as possible. 

Among the suggestions in the last thread were posting a picture ""so Cowboys it would make Tom Landry shed a tear."" I think it's a good idea, but I'm open to hearing more suggestions before I open up the contest for our community. 

I believe that the winner should be decided on how many upvotes his/her post gets in the thread.

As a reminder for the winner, I will be paying for the price of the pizza and if you want it delivered I will cover that as well. I only request that you-the winner-will tip that pizzeria well. I will message the winner when the contest is over and we will discuss when he/she would like the pizza.

""Well, he's doesn't have an arm like Aaron Rodgers... Or.. Or Tony Romo, but what he did for his team last season-""

Made me warm and nice inside having Romo in the same category with Rodgers. :)
