[possible spoilers],darthnoid,459,94,118,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/twri4/how_to_get_to_whimsyshire_secret_level_possible/,"Hey guys!  Thought I'd type up a little guide how to get to the special land of happiness and rainbows since I just did it last night and had to go to a million different websites and places to figure out how to get all the pieces and parts.

You need several things:
1. Black Mushroom (Act I)
2. Liquid Rainbow (Act II)
3. Gibbering Gemstone (Act III)
4. Wirts Cowbell (Act II)
5. [Plans: Staff of Herding] (Act IV)
6. Leorics Shinbone (Act I)


Reminder: You can acquire these parts in any order.  The guide is written in a chronological order for simplicities sake.

Pro-Tip: Get some friends to do this with you. For the RNG parts, run them individually until you encounter the chest/rarespawn you need, then have everyone join that game.

**From this point on, I will assume that you have completed one play-through of the game so consider this a spoiler warning for any potential spoilers it may contain.**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part One: Black Mushroom**

The black mushroom is located in Act I, in the Cathedral.  I saw lots of places that said that it could spawn on any floor which I found to be complete bullshit.  I watched many different videos and read several different guides and in each picture they were located in the exact same place in the exact same room on the exact same floor. 

My recommendation is to start the quest ""Return to Tristram"" on Normal.  

The following method is the one that I used to obtain the mushroom. Apparently you can find the mushroom on more than one layout as a rare spawn.  

Take the waypoint to the Cathedral garden, go up to the first floor and stop. If you do not immediately see a large staircase that you MUST walk up in order to continue backtracking, then you do not have the correct dungeon layout for it to spawn.  Town portal, Leave game, and resume again.  Repeat until you see a large stair case.  When you find it will be in a room shaped like this with two entrances. http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/3761/mushroomlocation.png (I snagged the image from a random page, no screenshots are mine). The mushrooms are a random spawn in the correct dungeon so keep leaving and zoning in until you get the right setup and explore until you find that room.  Once you find THAT room, if it's empty leave and do it again you won't find it anywhere else.  It's impossible to miss when you see it, it looks like I giant growth in the floor.

ALTERNATE METHOD:

Repeatedly clear Level 1 of the Cathedral until you find the mushroom, it will be in a room somewhere.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part two: Leorics Shinbone**

The shinbone is located in Leorics manor.  I forget the quest name, maybe the imprisoned angel or something.  Anyway, take the waypoint to leorics manor (the room where you walk forward a bit and there is a balcony and glass windows and stuff.  Back track until you are at the very start.  If you start walking back to where you were there is a room to the rightof the staircase .  At the end of this room is a fireplace, the shinbone is a rare spawn in the fireplace.  It will either be empty or have a clickable ""burnt firewood"" or something to that affect.  Click it and loot your shinbone. You may have to repeat it several times as it also is not a guaranteed spawn.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part three: Wirts Cowbell**

If you go to the last quest of Act III zone in and back track to the starting area. Go to the top left region of the map with the starting waypoint and look for a vendor named Squirt.  She will sell you Wirts Bell for 100k.  You can also get Wirts Cowbell from Squirt in Act II. She's in the market (near the sewer).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part four: Liquid Rainbow**

Take the waypoint to Path of the Oasis.  Follow the map along the southern most border until you find a little path heading further south to a little clearing.  Look for Zaven the Alchemist, who must be saved from Deathly Haunts.  He is not always down there. If you save him he will open a path to a dungeon.  You must explore this for a mysterious chest or a resplendent chest (as reported in the comments). The alchemist dude is a rare spawn, and the chest is a rare spawn within the dungeon. Good luck and happy RNG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part five: Gibbering Gemstone**

Go to Act III, take the waypoint to the bridge of korsikk. Run through the field ahead of you and check the top left corner, bottom left corner, and bottom right corner of the map for Cave of Frost Level 1.  Again, the dungeon is a rare spawn.  Inside the dungeon on floor two, you may get a rare spawn creature named Chiltara.  It will drop the gemstone.  I'd recommend running this on normal running past everything until you get to the second floor, and fully exploring the second floor to find him.  Another rare spawn within a rare spawn type deal.  Happy RNG.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part six: The damn Blacksmithing Pattern.**

Rare drop off of Izhual.  Start at the third quest.  Clear up to izhual, which you will encounter during the quest The Prime Evil.  I thought I started too far but you fight him right before diablo.  This one is a pain in the ass unless your lucky, because killing the boss gives you a checkpoint and you have to reclear completely and kill him again.  I was lucky enough to get it my first try. But my friends were not.


Once you get all these items. Train the blacksmith with your pattern, and make the item (costs about 50k for the staff.)

Take it to Act I. Take the old tristram waypoint and head to the left back to the Old Tristram Road (you must be on normal with this version of the staff).  If you follow the map border down the side of the map you will see a ghost come out of a cow skeleton. Talk to him and he will open the portal.  Have fun.

**Nightmare, Hell, and Inferno versions of the staff.**

In order to access Whimsyshire on a higher difficulty than normal you must first obtain the version of the staff as listed above.  Once you have it you must go to Act IV on the next highest difficulty (you must be on nightmare to obtain the nightmare blacksmithing plan). Take the waypoint to Basion Keep, and head all the way to the right and find the healer.  Next to him there should be a vendor that sells the plan for 1g. It may not be on them the first time so leave and try again.


 The only reagent for the new staves are the one you already have and a large quantity of gold. As reported, the normal staff is 50k, nightmare is 200k, hell is 500k, and inferno is 1million.


Good luck guys, have fun! Thanks for reading.

As for my copies, I've made my selections and will be messaging them with the Keys. I hope you all get a chance to play the game!

Also, I will have extra guest passes. If I didn't pick you, but you still want to jump on the game, please send me a private message with the subject D3 Guest Pass. I will try to get some to you as soon as possible. These are first come first serve.
************************************************


First, I am not affiliated with GAME, Blizzard, or any other retailers. 

I purchased a few extra copies of the game for some friends, but they all ended up getting the Collector's Edition. Rather than try to sell them off, I want to give them to some of you that got royally screwed by GAME :(

I don't know how I would go about verifying that you pre-ordered it, so if you know how, that would be great. I don't know how many of you there are, so I would like to make this fair and not just first come first serve. Any idea how I can get this done in an organize manner?

Also I'll likely just give you the code for the game, and if you want the box, I can send it to you if you pay shipping. 



***Edit: A picture of the pre-order receipt would definitely work. That's great!

As for figuring out who to give it to, maybe tell me an interesting about your Diablo experience, whether it's from D1, D2, or even while waiting for D3. Then I can come back later today and pick the top rated stories. 

I would love to give you all a copy, but since I have a limited amount, I will have to pick somehow. 

***Edit: Someone brought up a good point that most of the orders may have just been a down payment and not a full purchase. I'm not asking for money, but I will have to put a priority on someone that had already payed the full amount.

1340386791.0,307,self.diablo3,vg0lq,New Hardkore Mode,havoK718,467,160,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/vg0lq/new_hardkore_mode/,"My grandpa works at Blizzard and he told me that there will be a new HARDKORE mode to accommodate everyone who are complaining about how recent patches have made the game too easy. This mode is only for the most EXTREME of gamers. It's basically Diablo 3 version 1.0.0 with a few changes to make it good enough for all the extreme pro elitist gamers that just hate these damn FING CASUAAAALS that ""ruin my game"". These changes include:

**More vases, pots and barrels**

The amount of vases in the game has been quadrupled. Certain areas had too many ""monsters that fight back"" and were depopulated to make room for more vases. Areas without vases were removed from the game. Gamers now enjoy endgame content like vase smashing all day long without having to reload so often. 

Vases now have a chance to spawn as Rare and Champion Vases. These provide additional challenges for our elite players as they require an extra attack to destroy. The royal crypt has been modified to contain respawnable vases and exciting new events where you must destroy at least 500 vases in order to advance. The Skeleton King is replaced with Leoric's Pot of Gold, a super elite that takes 100 clicks to defeat. 

**Tyrael all the time**

The angel of justice will fight for you throughout the entire game, should some damn monster scum get in between you and your vases. Fighting is for casual trash, real men hide behind slightly more realer men.

**More treasure goblins**

Elite players are complaining because they have to make so many new games at the ancient path to engage in the fun act of goblin farming, so this mode now fixes it by containing areas that are basically just huge, empty areas with the occasional goblin here and there. Usually near some vases. All Act bosses and minibosses have been replaced with slightly bigger treasure goblins.

**Retro Balancing**

Sick of Blizzard nerfing your exploitable builds? Tired of IAS nerfs and other limits/readjustments that prevent you from easymoderolling through the game because all these FING CASUAAAAAALS were too poor to get IAS gear? No more! In this mode all the balancing will be reminiscent to Diablo II. You can stack enough IAS to attack twenty times a second, you can have 50% life leech and be invincible, you can have bugged torsos that give 5000 armor, and of course you can have incredible movement speed allowing you to zip through an open field in less that 10 seconds, runewords that have a 50% chance to make the moon crash onto your foe every time they hit you, equips that grant stats like Crushing Blow that rip bosses to shreds in seconds, spammable potions that make it impossible to die, and so on. No more nerfed IAS, no more nerfed life leech, no more 125% movement speed cap! Enjoy freedom that a filthy little FING CASUAAAAAAAL couldn't appreciate!

**Readjusting of item stats**

To match the playstyle of the most elite Diablo III gamers, noob stats such as Vitality or Resistance have been removed so equipment can have more stats that matter, such as IAS, crit bonus and primary stats. In addition, a few more hardkoar stats have been added:

   - Increased Vase Breaking Speed
   - Increased Respawn After Death Speed
   - +Damage Against Goblins
   - +Damage For Tyrael
   - % Better Chance of Finding Magical Items in Resplendent Chests
   - % Better Chance of Finding Magical Items on Goblins
   - % Extra Gold from Vases
   - Increased New Game Making Speed

**Character Customization is back**

People aren't all the same anymore! You now get points when you level up that you can put in whatever stat you want so the game doesn't force FING CASUAAAAAAAL stats such as Vitality onto you anymore. Oh but you cant just allocate them anywhere because weapons now have stat requirements that you must meet. Also once you set a skill, rune or stat, it is set in stone and you can't change it like an indecisive casual that doesn't have the balls to stick to their build. Respecs are planned to be available in roughly 10 years.

**Simplified Boss Farming**

Hardkore elite gamers were complaining that farming a boss was too complicated and all the Nephalem Valor business was the exact opposite of what they wanted. All this fun business that only caters to FING CASUAAAALS is removed. To make it even more efficient, other nuisances such as having to log out and make a new game once the boss is dead, have also been fixed. Basically, bosses now have infinite hp and just sit there in a corner while the player bashes them like a pinata and loot is automatically sent to his stash.

**New Spells, Runes and Passive Skills**

The reasoning behind this is that certain abilities would be too hardcore for all the casual kids and their soccer mom schedules on the scrub servers, so they only exist on hardkore mode. Per example, for the barbarian class:

   - **New Spell: Elite Shout** This Spell Increases Tyrael's damage by 50%, his attack and movement speed by 25%. Generates 25 fury, lasts for 30 seconds, cooldown of 30 seconds.

   - **Runes:**
       - Loot Time - Also increases your Gold Find and Magic Find by 30%
       - Power of Justice - When Tyrael kills an enemy, they explode, dealing damage to surrounding enemies for 80% of Tyrael's base damage
       - Angelic Shout - When Tyrael crits, he adds a debuff to the enemy that makes them drop twice as much loot
       - Wrath of the Angels - Tyrael now uses the Whirlwind spell
       - Holy Destruction - Automatically breaks all vases within 50 yards of Tyrael

   - **New Runes for old Barbarian Spells:**
       - Whirlwind / Vase Destruction - Vases you destroy with whirlwind drop twice as much gold and you also generate 5 fury for each vase destroyed
       - Frenzy / Gold Rush - Additional to the extra IAS you also get 10% extra gold find to each stack
       - Ancient Spear / Goblin Harpoon - If you use it on a goblin, you catch their sack and get all the loot without having to fight like a casual noob
       - Ignore Pain / Ignore Elite - All the elites disappear when you use this spell so you can rush straight to the boss
       - Overpower / Overpowered - adds a 10% chance to cast Mind Blast when struck, 20% chance to cast Terror when struck, 33% chance to cast confuse on striking

   - **New Passive Spells for Barbarians:**
       - Treasure Hunt - Increases the chances of finding a goblin
       - Vacism - Your attacks automatically smash vases nearby
       - Vase Looting - +50 yards to gold pickup radius
       - Vasectomy - Doubles the speed at which the Barbarian kicks vases

Of course, other classes will also get a similar overhaul of awesome new abilities suited towards a hardcore playstyle.

If you haven't read it yet, you can read it [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/sqfxn/the_story_so_fara_recount_of_what_has_happened/)

At the conclusion of the Sin Wars, a truce was struck between Mephisto and the Argiris Council to leave the Sanctuary and not meddle in human affairs.  In return for leaving the mortal realm, Mephisto wanted Inarius as his prisoner.  The Argiris Council agreed, and the Prime Evils with drew from Sanctuary (I have a feeling that a corrupted Inarius will be a boss in Diablo III at one point or another since he has not appeared in Diablo I or II).  Of course Diablo, Mephisto and Baal and did not keep their end of the promise, and would continue to influence and recruit humans to do their bidding.  Against the will of the other council members, Tyrael, the Archangel of Justice would intervene and help the humans fight against the demons of hell as they slowly invaded the mortal world.

The lesser evils thought that the three Prime Evils meddling in human affairs was detracting from the great conflict against the Heavens.  Their hatred for the heavens was immense and their hatred for the Prime Evils grew stronger and stronger with each new incident with the humans. Eventually they banded together and revolted.  The 4 lesser evils are:

•	[Duriel - Lord/Prince of Pain](http://i.imgur.com/ALESN.jpg)   
•	[Andariel - Maiden of Anguish](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3Kq.jpg)  
•	[Azmodan - Lord of Sin](http://i.imgur.com/VyeHj.jpg)  
•	[Belial - Lord of Lies](http://i.imgur.com/hA0Zs.jpg)

Their revolution was successful and the 3 Prime Evils were banished from hell.  This was known as the Dark Exile.  The Prime Evils were forced to walk the land of the living, spreading their evil and chaos wherever they went.  Diablo’s spirit was known as Dialon, Baal’s was Bala, and Mephisto’s was Mefis.  They made up the 3 pillars of the Triune Cult, led by the Primus (Grand Priest) who was Mephisto’s son, Lucion, in disguise.   The cult’s symbol was a triangle, with each point of the triangle being one of the 3 Prime Evils.  The Triune cult had temples throughout the land of Sanctuary where they recruited naïve humans and corrupted their souls.

To stop the Prime Evils spread of chaos and destruction, Tyrael created the botherhood of Magi, known as the Horadrim.  They are the ones who created the Horadric Cube and Horadric Staff.  Notable members of the Horadrim are Tal Rasha  (very important dude), Jered Cain and our beloved Deckard Cain.  The Horadrim was made up of 3 major mage clans, and each clan was tasked with defeating one of the 3 Prime Evils.  Tyrael gave the Horadrim 3 soulstones, magical artifacts that was capable of imprisoning powerful beings such as the Prime Evils.  

The first to be captured and imprisoned was Mephisto, the oldest brother.  His soulstone was buried in a vault beneath the Temple of Light in Kurast (You travel here in Diablo II - Act 3 to kill Mephisto, the quest is called The Guardian).  The next to be captured was Baal, the middle brother.  His capture was much harder, and led the Horadrim to chase him all the way to the Northern Desserts of Lut Gholein (You travel here in Diablo II - Act 2 to kill Baal, but that doesn't turns out as planned.  I'll go into it more when we get to the Diablo II section).   During the fight in the dessert, Baal was able to shatter the soulstone when they attempted to imprison him.  Eventually Baal was subdued by Tal Rasha, one of the most powerful mages.  In an attempt to seal Baal without a soulstone, Tal Rasha impaled the largest shard of the soulstone into his chest, and used his body to imprison Baal within him, thus dooming his own fate.  He would then wrestle with the demon within him for all eternity as his students sealed him in a secret tomb in the desert (Canyon of the Magi).  As the sand shifted and time passed, the location was lost and forgotten, until the events of Diablo II.

The last to be captured was Diablo, the youngest and some argued to be the most powerful of the brothers.  Led by Jered Cain, the Horadrim chased Diablo for nine years, fighting the terror that he would unleash on the land.  They eventually tracked him all the way west, to Khanduras.  After a devastating battle, Diablo was sealed in the soulstone deep within the cave system underneath Khanduras.  They built a monastery on top to guard the location and entrance, but as time passed, the last of the Horadrim died and faded away.  Eventually, the monastery fell to ruins. Only one Horadrim remains, Deckard Cain.  It is here, underneath Khanduras that Diablo remains trapped for two centuries.  

It was around this time, that King Leoric came to Khanduras.  King Leoric was a powerful and religious Northern Lord who had made Tristram his new home. He renovated the monastery ruins into a marvelous Cathedral and ruled the land with justice.  With time, the people grew to respect King Leoric and his rule. This ends the prologue of Diablo I, and we now dive into the events of the Diablo I game.

###Diablo I

As the soulstone became more corrupt over time, Diablo's influence grew stronger and further to the countryside.  The most important of these subjects was Lazarus, the arch bishop to King Leoric (sound familiar?  This storyline was revisited at the beginning of the Diablo 3 beta).  Lazarus advised King Leoric to start wars with the neighboring states, causing his loyal knights to lose faith in their king.  

Diablo wanted to possess King Leoric himself because he needed a physical body, but the king's will was too strong and Diablo was too weak from corrupting the soulstone.  This attempted possession and Lazarus constant whispering of corruption into the king's ear drove the him mad. Unable to possess the king, Diablo lured his son, Prince Albrecht into the catacombs underneath the cathedral and possessed him instead.  Diablo (it was Lazarus who really did it, but he was under Diablo's control so technically, it was Diablo) inserted the soulstone into Prince Albrecht's forehead, and gain mortal form.  The king accused the townspeople's of his son's disappearance, and had many executed.  Eventually, the king's knights were forced to slain him as his madness grew daily and more people were being executed.

Countless people were being lured into the catacombs and being slaughtered by ""The Butcher"" as well.  These sacrifices allowed Diablo to summon countless demons into the catacombs and they spread to the countryside attacking farmers.  As rumors of the demons spread through out the land, countless heroes came to Tristram to subdue the demon spawns.  One of these heroes, is you, the player.  You eventually un-cover the true cause and ventured into the catacombs to fight the butcher. The unnamed hero descends through sixteen levels of the labyrinth before encountering and killing Diablo.  

After defeating Diablo, the unnamed hero (player) removed the soulstone from Diablo's head, revealing that it is Prince Albrecht's body.  Realizing that Diablo's spirit can just possess another body if left free, the unnamed hero plunged the soulstone into his own forehead.  With all his will power and might, the unnamed hero fought to contain Diablo within his own body.  He travels aimlessly through out the land, but always East for some reason.  Perhaps it is Diablo's doing (it is), or perhaps he is seeking powerful mages in the Far East to help him sub due Diablo's soul once and for all.  This unnamed hero will become the [Dark Wanderer]( http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs47/f/2009/223/9/8/The_Dark_Wanderer_by_DefiledVisions.jpg) that we run into in Diablo 2.  

Well that wraps up Diablo I and the prologue.  I'll start on Diablo 2 when I can find some time.  Let me know if you have any questions, and I'll try and answer them as best I can.  As always, feel free to correct any incorrect information or interject anything I had left out.  Thanks all!

**TL;DR - There was an evil gang and the 4 smaller dudes wasn't happy with the 3 bigger thugs, so they kicked them from their turf.  These 3 bigger thugs then went on to cause a shit storm on this new turf until they were put in jail by the Horadrim popo. One of them manage to escape but he got a beat down. THE END, no j/k**

Edit: It has been revealed by those lucky enough to be part of the closed beta that Blizzard has ret-conned (or perhaps just provided more information) some stuff in Diablo I.  SPOILER ALTER! SPOILER ALERT! STOP! HALT! Do not read on unless you want information from D3's story.  The two biggest pieces of info are that the unnamed hero who was the player, is the eldest son of King Leoric, Aiden.  Before traveling East, he had bear a child with a women named Adria.  He left before the child was born, and never got to see his beautiful daughter, Leah (DUN DUN DUN!).  Thank you to [DisRuptive1](http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/sr5yj/the_story_continues_prolog_and_events_of_diablo_i/c4gc6ug) for providing me this information.  

Edit 2: Fixed some typos and added a little bit more information regarding Diablo's capture.

for windows users:

* go into your documents&amp;gt;diablo3&amp;gt;d3prefs
* this should open up a text file, find the line that says 
* DisableTrilinearFiltering ""0""
* change the 0 in that line to 1. this will disable trilinearfiltering.

for mac users: 

* Click on the background of your desktop to make sure you in the ""Finder Menu""
* Hold Down the Option Key and hit GO, then click Library (should show up under home)
* Open the Application Support Folder
* Open the Blizzard Folder
* Open The Diablo III Folder
* You will see a file called D3Prefs.txt open that with your text editor
* You will see a line that says DisableTrilinearFiltering ""0"" change this to DisableTrilinearFiltering ""1""
* save file!



after making this little change i went from a static 20 fps in act IV to a solid and consistent 70 fps.

sorry if this is a repost, but i figure somebody out there might benefit from this and turn a barley playable game into smooth as butter.

Edit: I'm very excited to hear that this helped a lot of you, for those of you who didn't find this helpful I'm sincerely sorry if I got your hopes up, hopefully you can find a solution to your issue.

What is the deal with Inferno?

Well Inferno is certainly hard, it's a challenge, no doubt in that, but personally I think it's one of the poorest implementations to ever happen on a AAA title.

There are two main ways to make a game more difficult, by mechanics and by numbers, when you make a game harder by mechanics you create new mechanics or mix them up, so it requires more skill to play the game properly, it requires work, but makes for fun gameplay and a sense of achievement, this is the method which WoW used to an extent, deadmines was less complex than molten core.

The second way is by numbers, if the enemies hit twice as hard, attack twice as fast and have twice the hp, it's obviously going to be harder to kill them, hence the game will be harder, this is lazy design and is usually applied to grindfests, for example, disgaea.

Then what is the problem with Inferno? as I see it, the problem is that it's design is simply bad, anyone can make a difficulty by throwing a keyboard down the stairs when it comes to handle the numbers, and it's no fun dealing with it, encountering a group which pulls you to them and then instakills you isn't fun, getting snared and killed without any chance of survival isn't fun, getting walls around you so you are cornered and trying to kill everyone before they oneshot you without any success isn't fun.

Is it hard? sure it is, but it's also borderline broken, mediocre game design.

EDIT: For some reason, there are a number of people claiming im ""butthurt"", frustrated, mad, crying over the matter or similar, I'd appreciate it if there was any arguing along with that, I'd also like to point out that I'm barely capable of giving a single fuck about myself being able to beat inferno or not, this is just my take on the matter and the dicussion about it.",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,1337803399.0,,,True,t3_u0w4t,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/u0w4t/the_problem_with_inferno/,

Hello everyone, I’m glad you’re all enjoying my threads about the lore and stories of the Diablo series.  In my part 2 thread where I was explaining the events of Diablo I, I accidently revealed some information regarding Diablo’s 3 storyline.  I have decided to keep any references to Diablo 3 minimal as to not spoil it for others.  If do I reference anything, I will try and use a spoiler tag.  With that said, let just dive into the events and fascinating twists and turns of Diablo 2, and hopefully, ~~the Lord of Destruction expansion pack!~~ It got way too long, so I will be breaking that off into another post. The post was too long to all fit in the header, please check the comments for Act III and IV (I know asking for upvotes of any kind is wrong, but I'm not doing it for selfish reasons.  Please upvote that comment so others can see it easily. All these posts have been self posts, so I don't get any sort of Krama, well except your kind comments. Thank all!).  

###Prologue
    
At the end of Diablo I, our unnamed hero, ** ***SPOILER*** ** who has been retconned to be Adian, King Leoric’s eldest son, ** ***END SPOILER*** ** had become the Dark Wanderer.  He impaled the soulstone into his forehead and carried Diablo’s spirit within him.  He struggled with the demon and fought to control his own body, but Diablo was too strong and quickly corrupted our hero.  

*“Many moons have passed since I left the town of Tristram behind me. Since then I've tried to forget the terrors I beheld beneath the cold earth, and the twisted nightmares that have haunted my every waking moment. There’s something dark within me now; I can feel it, driving me towards the East, assuring me that my salvation lies within the ruins of ancient kingdoms. Though I know the way, I know not what perils will arise to hinder my journey, and as I pass through the first gate, I know that the better part of my soul will remain behind… forever.”*

###Opening Cinematic

The [opening cinematic for Diablo II]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0kPXdtz_c4) introduces us to Marius, a frail old man with a broken mind and soul.  He is hiding inside an asylum when Tyrael (Baal disguised as Tyrael) finds him and ask him why he did not complete the task he had asked of him.  He then narrates the rest of the opening cinematic, revealing that he was living at the Rogue Monastery when the demons attacked.  The demons attacked following the orders of Diablo/The Dark Wanderer.  Marius was one of the few survivors that were able to escape from the Rogue Monastery.  He sought refuge in a nearby tavern and smokes heroine to rid his mind of the horrible nightmares he has from the attack on the Monastery.  This is where he encounters the Dark Wanderer and it is revealed that our hero from Diablo I was losing the battle to control his body.  Diablo’s spirit summons demons from within him and kills everyone in the tavern, except Marius.  He is spared once again.  Compelled by Diablo’s calling, Marius followed the Dark Wanderer as he travels further East.

*""Why did I follow him...? I don't know. Why do things happen as they do in dreams? All I know is that, when he beckoned... I had to follow him. From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.""*

###Act I – The Sightless Eye

We are then taken in game and pick one of the 5 heroes to play as.  The story goes that the heroes traveled as a group, and slain the evils that the Dark Wanderer unleashed on the land.  We are always a step behind the Dark Wanderer, and never really catch up with Diablo until Act 4.  The player starts in the Rogue Encampment, a camp made by the survivors of the Rogue Monastery on the outskirts of Khanduras.  The heroes are tasked with clearing out the evils in the surrounding area and to save the last Horadrim, Deckard Cain (yayyyyy).  The passage through the Rogue Monastery must be cleared before we can travel east, as this is the only passage through the mountains.  However, it is currently being guarded by [Andariel , the Maiden of Anguish](http://i.imgur.com/Eb3Kq.jpg).  She was put here to guard the passage and keep anyone from following Diablo.  Andariel is defeated after traversing through the Monastery halls clearing out the countless demons, and we continue onward, to Lut Gholein.

###Act II – The Secret of the Vizjerei

We reach Lut Gholein and realize that this city too, is drenched in evil.  The air carries the smell of dead flesh, and demons lurk beneath the city sewers.  These monsters terrorize the citizens at night, killing and taking what they find.  After clearing out the sewers, the heroes consult with Lord of Lut Gholein and his Wizard Drognan to conclude that the Dark Wanderer is really Diablo and he is seeking the long lost Tomb of Tal Rasha, somewhere in the desert.  

[Diablo seeks to free his brother, Baal, from imprisonment]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkJRxBlZi70) and continue his reign on the mortal world.  In order to open Tal Rasha’s Tomb, the Horadric Staff must be reassembled, as this is the key to chamber in which Baal has laid dormant for over two centuries.  The heroes search the endless desert to reassemble the staff, and ventures into the Arcane Sanctuary, an ethereal realm, to find the where about of Tal Rasha’s Tomb.   After defeating [The Summoner]( http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/The_Summoner) and finding Horazon’s Journal,  it is revealed that the tomb is concealed in the Canyon of The Magi.  

The heroes rushed to the tomb with urgency to stop Diablo from freeing Baal, but upon opening the chamber with Horadic Staff, they realize that they were too late.  Standing guard was one of the lesser evils, [Duriel, the Lord/Prince of Pain](http://i.imgur.com/ALESN.jpg).  His icy attacks chilled our heroes to the bone, but by this point, they had grown strong (with some epic loot and rare magic find (OP as shit right?)).   After Duriel is defeated, the heroes enter Baal chamber to find Tyrael constrained by chains that once held the now cunning and sly Baal (it is said that when Tal Rasha plunged the soulstone into his chest and imprisoned Baal within him, he passed onto Baal all his intellect and knowledge).  The heroes free Tyrael as he reveals [what had happened merely days before]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdgwRT5dLt8).  The Dark Wanderer and his follower Marius had entered the tomb to free Baal.  Tryrael descended from the Heavens to stop Diablo, and they fought with clashing lights and burning fire.  While the battle raged, Marius was drawn to Baal, his demonic voice urging Marius to with draw the soulstone from his chest.  Unable to resist, Marius freed Baal.  Tyrael grabbed Marius and instructed him to go to the Temple of Light in Kurast, where the gates of hell will open before him.  He must find the courage to enter through it and destroy the soulstone on the Hell Forge.  Frightened and bewildered, Marius fed the tomb with Baal’s soulstone fragment and headed toward the Temple of Light.  Now alone, Tryrael had to face a an almost fully recovered Diablo and a very angry Baal who has endured centuries of imprisonment.  This proved too much for the Archangel of Justice, and he soon fell to their combined power.  He was imprisoned here until the heroes arrived.  Tyrael urges the heroes to travel east toward the city of Kurast, to stop Diablo and Baal from freeing and reuniting with their eldest brother, Mephisto, The lord of Hatred.

This was originally posted by WRECK on the Diablo3 forums, but Blizzard keeps deleting these and i feel without these posts no one will hold Blizzard accountable for their mistakes.

""Well I have to applaud Blizzard in all reality. From a business stand point it would seem like you're on the perfect track to make the shareholders at Activision very, very pleased.

You've taken a game with so much hype built around it, a game with a rabid and wildly large fan base, a game vaulting off of the massive success of the previous generation - and you've turned it into your sacrificial lamb.

I understand that WoW is dying. The cash cow that you have been able to depend on to fill your coffers is finally drying up. It had a great run. MoP is not likely to defibrillate the failing heart of what was once the WoW empire, and you know this. Starcraft 2, while an amazing game, cannot replace this cash cow - then again it wasn't meant to. How could it? Your business foresight is very, very attuned. Because of this you carefully planned your next chess move: Diablo 3.

What better way to birth another golden goose than to bank an entire game off of the most addictive part of what Diablo 2 was: the item grind. Pure brilliance. And so, from the ground up, you formed this game to be solely about item exchange - this would be the titan built to replace WoW's subscription based bankroll in the form of micro transactions.

Except one thing: you're boring.

On May 15th 2012, after nearly a decade of anticipation, we were given Diablo 3! Except, it's not quite Diablo 3. It's a slimmed down, cut up version of the Diablo 3 everyone was taught to expect. Except, it wasn't given to us, we still had to pay you full price for it: $60.

My how the mighty hath fallen. Why is it not Diablo 3, you say? Well let's see. Anyone remember all those teaser videos spoon fed to the community over the past 3 years? Videos slowly leaking to us glimpses of the content we could expect to experience? I do.

From nearly FOUR years ago:

@2:10 ""These current weapons just won't do!"":

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K0YkUH6r6c&amp;list=UUCGf0PicJgNp6yb7xsdZAwA&amp;index=1&amp;feature=plcp

I guess scrapping this idea all together was more developmentally cost effective.

@6:30 ""Let's see what a real fight looks like.""

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RT4K6e2q10g&amp;list=UUCGf0PicJgNp6yb7xsdZAwA&amp;index=10&amp;feature=plcp

Indeed, lets. I'm still waiting, actually. Is it just me or does that environment look entirely more engaging than the atmosphere we've purchased at release?

@2:00 Did he say randomized, dungeons, quests and encounters?

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMAyxY7mjzI&amp;list=UUCGf0PicJgNp6yb7xsdZAwA&amp;index=7&amp;feature=plcp

If their idea of newly generated fights, quests and environments is a continuous cycle of the same things from a pre-conceived list, he's spot on!

So where's the beef? - some might say. The beef is that this is not Diablo 3, this is an imposter. A hologram. An artificial replacement. A lame duck substitute for what hype built it up to be. A cut up and slimmed down version of what should have been. In essence: a slaughtered, sacrificial lamb.

That leaves myself and thousands of others saying indeed, where is the beef? Blizzard's answer: there is no cow level. But hey, we got rainbows and unicorns!

Is anyone still in complete denial about how truly boring this game is or have people started to shake off the honey moon dust?

You eliminated enchanting, PvP, pet companions and other things from the release version so that you could market it as part of a later expansion for more money. (This is a trend in gaming that several developers have been following; withhold content you've been advertising for the past two years and charge a premium for it at a later date. I shouldn't have expected Activision-Blizzard to be any different, and that is my fault. I wrongly assumed this group was made of trend setters and leaders, not followers - so shame on me.)

You didn't include a single player mode because you can't make money off of people if they aren't using the AH in a multiplayer format. Less work for you in the development stages, and forces people to engage in the micro-economy that your bankroll is based on. Again, brilliance. Which leads me to my final point:

There is so LITTLE dynamic to this game I cannot believe it took this many years to create it. In fact, I don't. So why the long wait? I'll tell you: economic law.

More specifically, the legality and complications that stemmed from the idea of a multinational game built around a Real Money Auction House. This process, I imagine, took years to iron out - while the game itself probably took no more than a few actual working years to complete (and it truly shows).

It doesn't take an overly intelligent mind to figure WHY they would want to use a RMAH and get a cut of (a lot of) the transactions. That's fine. Here's the problem: you built the entire game around a pure gear grind, and then force that gear grind to revolve around the AH, specifically the RMAH. There is literally no other dynamic. When you build a game from a purely business stand point, you're not building a great game - and a great game this is not.

In conclusion, gamers, do you really want to spend your time on yet another slave-like gear grind? If so, eat your heart out. You'll find no better place to do it! If not, there are a plethora of other games out there much more deserving of your $60, I promise.

Diablo 3 was built around Activision's greed. Participate at your own will.

Gamers hold grudges and people aren't going to forget this disaster. If you obliterate your true fan base, the pillars of your success come falling soon after.

I give this post less than a few hours before it is deleted by Blizzard moderators. Can't have that bad flavor out there, can we? Truth hurts.

Regards, a long time fan.""",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,1338489030.0,,,True,t3_ud3i2,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/ud3i2/great_work_blizzard_must_read/,

I was a little mad when I logged into my wizard only to find my DPS cut in half. Matters were made even worse when I tried to continue my run through act II. If you have any gear that is sub par, and you try to run act II you are gonna have a bad time. I remember finishing the night after the patch with broken gear and no gold to repair it with. Things couldn't get worse. I put a few items that I did not want to sell on the AH (for gold to repair) and I logged out. The next day I had to work so I couldn't play till later in the day. I did however, get on this sub reddit and listen to all the bitching about the new patch. This will turn out to be a true test of my will to play this game. When I got home I was ready for the worst. I logged in, claimed the gold from my auction and repaired all my items (spending all my gold) back to broke. 

Now, this is where the fun starts. Like most inferno characters, I had grown accustomed to Warden/Butcher runs. This is where you go wrong. After patch 1.0.3 they added a nice feature to the stacks of nephalem. When you reach 5 stacks you are GUARANTEED a rare drop when you kill an elite pack. THIS IS SO AWESOME. I hit up my friend (60 monk) and he told me to join his game. Something I didn't realize is: If you start at the butcher quest you can actually go all the way back to every waypoint and farm all the elite packs. For example you can go to the fields misery and farm elite packs and the dungeon spawns. This shit is cray cray. After a little over an hour and a half I had 200k of gold (You sell A LOT of blues in the process). If you would rather salvage your blues you will lose some gold but have plenty of reagents. The trick is to start in an area and explore EVERYWHERE. Always keep 5 stacks of neph. When you have cleared all the way to Leorics manor you just start the butcher run like normal. When you are finished you will have a shit ton of yellows (me and my buddy both had legendary drops too!). Personally I prefer to keep all my yellows until the end. I ended up having a full inventory of unidentified yellows, and another 10-15 in the vault. it ended being over 35 rares in the span of under 2 hours. The best part: I spent 25k total on repairs (Worth it!). Time for an identification party!

The bottom line is blizzard has a lot of work to do with this game. Patch 1.0.3 was the first step in the right direction. They made the game wayyyy more fun to play. No more dark/dank cellar farming runs. No more treasure goblin runs. BTW we encountered 3 goblins during our run. 

Ill probably get downvoted to shit for the readability of this post. I dont care. I just wanted to get the word out. This subreddit should be more about discussing the game. Not hating on blizzard.

1335296412.0,188,self.diablo3,sqfxn,"The story so far...A re-count of what has happened from the beginning leading up to Diablo I.  If you like lore/story, you might like this (Warning, long text post)",malfore,227,39,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/sqfxn/the_story_so_fara_recount_of_what_has_happened/,"I wanted to start at the beginning so that people will get an overall understanding of how the mortal world came to be and to get a better understanding of what is happening in the subsequent Diablo I, II and III.  I didn’t read all the novels and books so some of this might be inaccurate.  Feel free to correct me if I'm saying anything that isn’t true, but for the most part it should give everyone an idea of how things came to be.  


There are basically three worlds in the Diablo Universe, The High Heavens, Burning Hell, and the mortal world known as Sanctuary.  In the beginning, Sanctuary did not exist and neither did humans.  There was only the High Heavens and Burning Hell.  The two worlds battled each other endlessly for control in what is known as the Great/Eternal Conflict.  This war has lasted since the beginning of creation, and while each side would gain the advantage every now and then, it has pretty much been a stalemate.   


The burning hell was lead by the three Prime Evils, [Diablo](http://i.imgur.com/PisZV.jpg) and his two brothers Baal and [Mephisto](http://i.imgur.com/1kK78.jpg).  The High Heavens was lead by the Angiris Council, a group of very powerful Archangels.  There was 5 total.  They are:

•	[Tyrael - The Archangel of Justice (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/uN76t.jpg)   
•	[Auriel - The Archangel of Hope (Female)](http://i.imgur.com/izYCc.jpg)  
•	[Malthael – The Archangel of Wisdom (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/DQHx0.jpg)  
•	[Imperius – The Archangel of Valor (Male)](http://i.imgur.com/N9m3A.jpg)  
•	[Itherael – The Archangel of Fate (Sexless, neither male or female)](http://i.imgur.com/FEJ9q.jpg)


There was one more powerful Archangel that acted as an advisor to the Angiris Council, and his name was [Inarius](http://i.imgur.com/gEsTL.jpg) (Male).  Inarius was tired of the endless conflict with neither side able to win decisively.  He longed for a more peaceful world where there wouldn’t be constant conflict.  He gathered other Angels and Demons who felt the same way and created Sanctuary, the mortal world.  Using the powers of Worldstone that he stole, Inarius hid the presence of Sanctuary from Heaven and Hell.    


Humans were the off springs of Angels and Demons that lived in Sanctuary and were very powerful at first.  The first generations of humans were known as Nephalem, and had the potential to be even more powerful than either Angels or Demons.  Fearing that humans would become more powerful than him, Inarius modified the Worldstone to make each generation of human weaker and weaker, draining them of their innate powers.  He wanted humans to worship him, and created a relgion/cult called the Cathedral of Light.  The Prime Evils were the first to discovered Sanctuary, and attempted to gain influence over the population and recruit them as soldiers in the Great Conflict.  Not wanting to alert the high heavens of Sanctuary's existence, they formed a religion/cult called the Triune.  Both religion recruited followers and used them for their own purpose.   


A lot more happens before the events of the first Diablo, and they are told through the “Sin War” novels by Richard A. Knaak.  Basically the humans tap into their powers to fight back against the Demon and Angels.  Inarius is eventually defeated by a human named Uldyssian, the strongest human who lead a revolt against Inarius and the Triune (cult of the prime evils).  In order to defeat Inarius, Uldyssian tapped into the Worldstone and unleashed his tremendous power, so great in fact that it was going to destroy all of Sanctuary.  Once he realized this, he sacrificed himself to save the mortal world.  This is when the Agiris Council discovered Sanctuary and what Inarius has done.  They descended into Sanctuary and were going to destroy it since they viewed it as an abomination tainted with demon blood.  After all, humans were half demon as they were the off spring of Angels and Demons.    


Of the 5 in the Agiris Council, 2 voted no to destroying Sanctuary and 1 voted yes, with Malthael, the Archangel of Wisdom abstaining from voting.  Tyrael, the last to vote, was originally disgusted by the tainted humans and wanted to destroy it.  If he had voted yes, the tie would have doomed Sanctuary for destruction.  However, after seeing Uldyssian’s sacrifice, he voted no and Sanctuary was spare.  Tyreal was so impressed by Uldyssian’s act because Uldyssian had basically become all powerful.  He would have been a god, but at the cost of his world.  Willing to give up his power and his life for the lives of so many others was extremely selfless, and it moved Tyrael.  This made Tyrael see the good in mankind, and he would come to their aid many more times as the prime evil invade their world.  I forget the reasoning of why this was done, but the events of the Sin War were erased from human minds.    


This wraps up the pre-diablo I history.  If you guys like this, I can try and do Diablo I and Diablo II as well.  I didn’t realize how long this would actually take and wanted to do all of them in one go, but it’s a little too much.  I didn’t want to do all the research/work and then realized that no one really cares about the lore.  Let me know what you think, and there is plenty of stuff out on the web as well to read through if you want to do your own research.  Leave me any questions you have and I’ll try and answer them as best as I can.  

**TL:DR - The moral world, Sanctuary was created by an Archangel Inarius and hidden from heaven and hell.  They eventually find it though, and SHIT GOT FUCKING REAL**

Edit:  There seems to be a genuine interest in the rest of the lore.  I wrote up everything up to and including Diablo I and will post it shortly.  Although [Crackensan did a quick summary](http://www.reddit.com/r/Diablo/comments/sqhuw/the_story_so_fara_recount_of_what_has_happened/c4g5wvc) of most of the events already leading all the way up to Diablo 3 so it's a great summary.

1348503152.0,172,self.diablo3,10ebu1,BEST diablo 3 farming route explained. (Plus epic Skorn),turbogoblin,221,49,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/10ebu1/best_diablo_3_farming_route_explained_plus_epic/,"I have been running with a lot of people lately, regardless of their dps, so that it increases the level of difficulty for me. I'm trying to make the game harder to prepare me for monster power level 10. The XP, MF, and GF bonuses will be worth the challenge I'm sure.

All of the people I run with are unfamiliar with my route, but all of them say it works extremely well. I have to admit, I stole it from Alkaizer and a streamer on twitch.tv named Nugiyen. Both of them are paragon level 100 and Nugi is a self made billionaire. He currently uses the second best manticore in the game. I feel like he has something useful to contribute since he plays a DH and so do I.

Anyway, here is the run I use:

1. Set quest to Kill Azmodan.

2. If this is your first time through the run start at the core of arreat and work your way through to the check point right before Azmodan. DO NOT KILL Azmodan. Simply port back to town and continue the run.

If this is not your first time through the run you will start at the checkpoint right before Azmodan. Work your way backwards through the core of arreat to the waypoint.

3. Port to The Tower of the Damned lvl 1. Complete a full circle here and then use the same waypoint to port to the Keep Depths 3.

3. Clear the Keep Depths 3 (usually 2-3 packs, sometimes 4 if you get the mini event) If you can, clear the Keep Depths in a way that you end up at the entrance to the Keep Depths 2 as this is our next destination. Otherwise port to town and then take the waypoint to Keep Depths 1. Walk straight through the door to the north of the waypoint into the Keep Depths 2.

4. Clear the Keep Depths 2. There will be a lot of packs here. Usually 5 or 6, I have seen more, and always one resplendent chest. When finished clearing, port back to town. 

5. Take the waypoint to the Arreat Crater lvl 2. Clear the crater all the way to the entrance of the Tower. Port back to town.

6. Take the waypoint to The Bridge of Korsikk. Clear the Fields of Slaughter, there will usually be between 3 and 4 packs here. Don't bother entering the Ice Caves, or the Caverns of Frost. Usually the enemy types in there are rather annoying (burrowing, lacuni, and those big bull type things...not very fun)

This is generally where my run ends. However, there are occasions where I add in certain areas, when playing with friends, when I'm really close to leveling, or if I want a change of pace. 

Optional areas are:

1. Rakkis crossing, go north first, the Underbridge is a nice dungeon. It's small, always contains only 1 pack, and sometimes has a goblin in it. After you have finished the Underbridge go back to the Rakkis crossing waypoint and head south until you meet The Fields of Slaughter. 

2. Stonefort. This is not the most efficient area in terms of monster and pack density, but it usually yields 4-6 packs and can spawn multiple goblins. This area favours players with skills that work well in confined spaces (specifically AOE attacks)

I don't generally bother with The Arreat Crater lvl 1, the density is too low and it can be a maze, with many dead ends. Don't bother with the Tower of the Cursed either, it's a waste of time in my opinion.

The name of the game here is efficiency. If you have to re-spec to slightly lower DPS for greater survivability, I would suggest doing that. My aim for these runs is to NEVER DIE. The less you die, the less you spend on repair bills. Also, running back to where you died takes a lot of time that you could be spending killing elite packs. 

This run yields on average 10 million XP.

I can complete this run with 0 deaths in around 18-20 minutes depending on how many packs I run into. This generally equates to about 30 million XP per hour. When I first started doing this run, it took nearly 30 minutes.  

I should add, at paragon lvl 48, and with 260 MF (with 5 stacks) I usually yield 1 legendary per 4 runs. Sometimes more than that. 

Try to get as close to movement speed cap as you can. I run with 24% move speed from Inna's Pants and Nat's Boots. The move speed alone can cut your run time by a couple of minutes.

TL;DR:

1. Core of arreat

2. Tower of the Damned lvl 1

3. Keep Depths 3

4. Keep Depths 2

5. Arreat Crater lvl 2

6. Bridge of Korsikk (Fields of Slaughter)

Move fast, don't die...profit.

Thus, the illusion of customizability... As where in D3 you can swap out skills and really no matter what skill set you have locked in you can always have viable options which really creates even more customizability, and then on top of that, being able to rune you skills, in theory I think this is more customizability then D2..

Every death in the game is followed by a little exercise. You can choose between: 20x situps 20x squats 20x crunches or 10x push ups. For a death on normal difficulty multiply these numbers by 3 and on nightmare/hell by 2, of course these numbers are the bare minimum and you should change them regarding your state of fitness.
Also if you are revived by a team member you should add a few ""repetitions of shame"" ;-)
And of course if you die on hardcore go outside and run at least 3 miles while shouting ""Whhhhhhyyyyyyyyy"". Have fun and report.",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,False,,,True,t3_v897m,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/v897m/get_fit_with_diablo_the_infernal_fitness_program/,

Hi all, this is my first post. Please forgive any formatting errors. Just let me know how to fix it if I need to and I'll do that. :) 


I'd like to share with you all the data I've collected throughout my journey of raising my Gold Find % and farming my life away. 


I'm a Demon Hunter and I've been using The Royal Crypts area to farm. (Inferno, Act I, Sword of the Stranger quest)

I currently make ~420k per hour with 262% Gold Find. To buy any more gold find gear would be extremely inefficient as I'll explain later. 


**Gearing Up**


To start off, I bought 15% GF items for all the slots I could, as long as the item was 20,000 or cheaper on the AH.  This got me up to 110% to start with using only ~160k. I then started farming and purchased upgrades as I went along. I'd try to find pieces close to 20-25% for 160k. I also got lucky and found a 29% GF amulet on one of my runs.


**Gold Find to Gold per Hour stats**

Whenever I upgraded to a higher GF%, I would do runs for an hour straight to get the most accurate gold per hour figure. (I know, I have way too much time on my hands)


* 110% - 255,000
* 196% - 287,121
* 209% - 317,886
* 225% - 354,145
* 240% - 392,189
* 262% - 420,629

All of this was over the span of about 3 days, and the total cost to get to 262% (including money I made back off of selling items I upgraded from) was approximately 1.8million.  This is not bad at all since I can now farm that back in 5 hours and the rest is all profit.


My original goal was to get to ~310% so I could make 500k/hr. However, to continue upgrading, it would cost me about 4 million more to get there. I decided spending 4 million for an extra 80k/hr is definitely not worth it, as it would take me 50 hours of farming just to break even on upgrades from this point alone. 


That's about all the information I recorded in the process. I hope this is interesting to some people. :)


**EDIT: [Video showing the route](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcQDQ1JAPE0)**




**EDIT2: After upgrading my GF by 6% and radius by 12, I increased my GP/hr by 100k. I'm now clearing 520k/hr and I'm thinking it's worth it to skip the monsters as long as you have enough radius to pickup gold without trying to run through them to get to it.**


**EDIT3: For people adding me just to ask how much I'm making now, I'll continue to update this edit to show my current stats:**

GF%: 302

Pickup Radius: 31

Movement Speed: 12%

Clear time: 45 seconds (average)

Gold per Hour: 750k




**I'm going to be putting together a comprehensive Gold Find guide over the next couple weeks which will include all of my experiments and data. I'd like to cover all classes and farming builds for them as well, so if you'd like to help, send me a message here or add me in-game: Jixx#1134**

Level 60 required 2.25M. They could have leveling to 70 or 65, but the experience needed is 20M, 50M, something large. I find item grinding boring, but if I can see a progress bar, I feel like I am earning something. Even if I can barely add to it, gathering 50M exp would give the feeling that I have accomplished something when I do not find any good items.

I'll admit it, once I hit 60, I immediately wanted to stop killing enemies. I enjoy the fact I am earning experience - it defines an RPG. Now I can only kill enemies to hopefully get a good item to kill more enemies. There is no progress, no fun. I'm assuming the D3 exp will have higher levels, I hope they require an excessive amount of experience.

In D2, you were item grinding, but you didn't mind doing 50 Baal runs as you were leveling your character, D3 lost that spark.",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,False,,,True,t3_wpgqf,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/wpgqf/idea_that_blizz_should_have_done_for_inferno/,

Hello everyone, this is the last installment in my Diablo lore explained series.  It has been a blast and I am so glad to see so many people enjoying my work.  I hope that these threads help refresh your memories or open your minds to the exciting story behind the Diabo games as we all look forward to the D3 release.  

###Opening Cinematic

At the end of Diablo II, Act IV, our heroes had just destroyed Diablo’s soulstone and meets up with Tyrael once more.  He informs the heroes that Baal, the last remaining Prime Evil has assembled a massive army and is now making [his assault on Mt. Arreat]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ7KgW_yi3E&amp;feature=relmfu), home of the courageous barbarian tribes.  These [barbarian tribes](http://i.imgur.com/NButc.jpg) lived for the glory of battle, and were considered to be some of the fiercest warriors Sanctuary had to offer.  This is why they were tasked with the important role of guarding Mount Arreat, home of the converted Worldstone.  

###Diablo II: Lord of Destruction – Act V

Tyrael opens a portal for our heroes to the barbarian city of [Harrogath, the Last Bastion of Order]( http://www.diablowiki.net/images/7/7b/Sanctuary_World_Map.jpg) on the slopes of Mt. Arreat.  It is here that we learn that Baal has laid waste to the Barbarian lands of the north on his way to Mount Arreat.  Destruction and suffering trails in the wake of his army, and what were once great barbarian fortresses, now lies in ruins.  Harrogath is the last Barbarian stronghold, and is currently under siege by Baal’s Army.  Many brave barbarians have died to defend the fortress, and many more die each day as the siege continues.  Shenk the Overseer, Baal’s most decorated general, is leading the siege against Harrogath.  

If not for the Druid “Spell of Warding”, Harrogath would have fallen long ago.  The Council of Elders, which comprised of the Barbarian’s wisest elders, received word that Baal’s army was coming and that many of their brethrens had failed to deter his ungodly army.  In a courageous act of selflessness and courage, they sacrificed their lives to cast the “Spell of Warding”, a warding spell that would par passage to any hell spawn, including the Lord of Destruction himself.  Only one person survived the casting of the spell, Nihlathak, who struggles daily with the guilt of being spared and the grief of his lost companions. While the spell has worked so far, it becomes weaker and weaker as the siege continues.  Even in these times of despair, the Barbarians fought on without a hint of uncertainty.  

##Siege of Harrogath

Fearing the worst however, they had no choice but to reluctantly accept the help of the seven heroes (originally there was 5 playable classes in Diablo 2, the LoD expansion added two more classes, the [Assassin](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Assassin) and the [Druid](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Druid).  This brings us up to a total of 7 heroes).  While the barbarians joined the heroes on the battlefield, they did not see them as equals, but rather as a mere distraction for the demons as the barbarians were the real warriors.  This attitude quickly changed as the barbarians’ bear witness to the ferocity that the heroes employed on the front lines.  The holy paladin, zealous in his attacks, brought justice down upon the demons spawn with his hammer over and over again.  Bolts of lightning and thunder ripped through the sky, while raging hydras of fire roared from the very bowels of earth, decimating anyone who dared to face the powerful sorceress, commander of nature’s elements.  At times, the heroes even charged into hordes of enemies that the eye could not see the end of, but always emerged victorious.  Never once did they linger to gloat in their feats of bravery, for they knew that there were many more battles to come.  They pushed on and on, down the slopes of Mount Arreat, pushing back Baal’s army, until Shenk the Overseer himself laid before them, impaled with the Amazon’s mighty arrows.  The siege of Haggorath had been broken, and Baal’s advance towards the Worldstone came to a sudden and jolting end.  Or so it seems…

##Prison of Ice

Unbeknownst to the Barbarian tribes and the heroes, a foul and treacherous plan was un-winding in the shadows.  Nihlathak, unable to handle the grief of his companion’s sacrifice and the failure of his people to defend Mount Arreat, pondered endlessly on what they could have done differently.  He concluded that there was only one way, and stuck a deal with the Lord of Destruction.  In return for Harrogath’s safety, Nihlathak will give Baal the Relic of the Ancients.  This holy totem allowed anyone who possesses it to bypass the Rite of Passage at the summit of Mount Arreat, and be granted access to the chamber of the Worldstone.   With the holy totem in hand, Baal and his army proceeded to the inner chambers of Mount Arreat, known as the Worldstone Keep. 

No one knew that this had happened, until Nihlathak and [Anya](http://diablo.wikia.com/wiki/Anya) were found to be missing.  Anya, the daughter of one of the Council of Elders, uncovers Nihlathak’s plan.  To avoid his secrete from being reveal, Nihlathak kidnapped Anya and imprisoned her in the icy caves of the Crystalline Passage.  It is not until the heroes rescued Anya that is information is revealed (The quest to kill Nihlathak, Betrayal of Harrogath, becomes available at this point, but it is optional).

I was playing several different mods for D2, but I just couldn't play those anymore. Skyrim is just another boring FPS game. Mass Effect(s) are too slow and boring with all the dialogue. Other games just got very boring for some reason. 

Anyone else get this feeling? Everything I tried playing that I used to enjoy just doesn't do it for me anymore. It's only a couple of weeks until launch, but I just can't find anything worth turning my PC on for these days except for reddit. I don't have high speed internet enough to download huge games nor play them online (3G internet) but can anyone suggest something for me to play/do until May 15?

EDIT: Some folks are getting upset with me because I am making up a lot of excuses not to play their suggested game. I am sorry. I really do have a limitation on what I play due to being on a 3G wireless internet connection. If you can't understand where I'm coming from, limit your download speeds to 1.5Mb/s (185kbps) and then raise your latency to mine (150-300ms) and you will probably start thinking like me.

His name is nenose514, and his character name is OTUa. He is a level 6 monk, with 19 hours played.

I think he may be running a bot to pick up the items.

I am know as Juxtapose in the diablo 3 community, playing/played on the EU servers.

First of all I am not here to cry, just simply to play open book with the community that I have been a part of for a long time. As the title says Cro has scammed me for 2500 euro worth of gear.. the items involved in the trade are:  

http://www.diabloprogress.com/item/34799695 

http://www.diabloprogress.com/item/34529709  

Also after these trades we made an agreement for 1500 euro on my axe if we would trade EF's for the time being, the following day he would pay and I would also give him his EF back (a good trade for him) + I donated him my zunimasa's boots roughly worth 150-200 euro to a ranking barb. 

With that being said the story is as follows; Cro paid me 1000 euro on the 20th for the amulet and 1500 euro for the ring on the 21st of june. The following day on the 22nd this money was blocked by paypal due possible unauthorized usage of a creditcard, a dispute/claim started by paypal , Iater I discoverd after phoning Paypal that  this was due to the fact his Paypal name was Twitch Cro, Paypal requires full names of the buyer and seller to keep proper documentation of trades. 

On the 6th of July the money was released by paypal in the afternoon, I spoke with cro later that evening with him declining that he had received any of the money, while my paypal record clearly said Completed and Instant payment. After ringing paypal on monday 8th of july I asked Paypal if there was a possibility of it taking maybe longer than this, they said it could take 1-3 days but if he would link the card that he used to his new account it would be available within a day. Also they 100% guaranteed me that he would have received a message in his paypals mail about the money being refunded, which many of us paypal users could confirm from experience.

With all this being said Cro was unbelievable hard to reach after the refund took place, he even removed/ignored me after we got into an arguement with me telling him I would go public if he kept ignoring me. He used this ""threat"" as an excuse, it gave me the feeling he was acting like he was being questioned by the authorities and this is his shield against that. Saying that he would break communications with me to protect himself from people such as other big streamers.

Despite of what I or him might think or say, the bottom line is, he has my items and he has not paid for them after I traded them goodbye on the 20th and 21st of last month. 
I will share all my paypal logs from this trade with everyone right now.

These are all the facts, as for feeling sorry for me, please don't. I trade and have traded with valueable items in the past and know the risk that it brings. I know people that have been scammed in diablo for 10 times this amount + these were only 2 of my items, I still have plenty for sale. As for trusting a famous member of the community and on twitch... well let us all learn from this. As you can imagine I was not pleased finding this out, also after trying to support this player with decent deals and donations, the knife will get that much sharper when piercing the back. All I can  really say after all this is that I have been CRO'D and I hope that nobody else has been or will be, have a nice day.",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,1373459474.0,,,True,t3_1i041n,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/1i041n/cro_the_streamer_scammed_me_for_2500_euro/,
1369003344.0,99,self.diablo3,1enooe,A guide to the AH and how you can make millions,bloozntooz,128,29,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/1enooe/a_guide_to_the_ah_and_how_you_can_make_millions/,"[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/1emias/tip_if_you_are_new_to_inferno_and_are_looking_at/) thread inspired me to make a guide for you guys. I didn't realize how difficult it was for some people to just work basic parts of the AH which probably explains why a lot of you hate having to use it. So here are a few methods and tips on how to make money + snipe gear for your guys at super low prices.  


With this guide you will basically learn how the basics of how to snipe items and sell them for an insane profit. I like to use legendary items for this because its easier. If you know how to trade feel free to use rares.  
 
[\(ScreenShot1\) ](http://imgur.com/LjO6JL0)   
The recommended items is a great spot to start out looking for gear.
Your currently selected hero will determine what gear you see here.
Look at my buyout buttons arrow, see how that is pointing up? Clicking buyout will  change which way that arrow faces. If it faces up, the cheapest items will start your list. If it faces down, the most expensive items will start your list. I'm not a fan of a hundred million gold on anything so I usually keep the arrow facing up.

**Now lets get started**  
**Get your search preferences setup **  
 1. Equipment search (Set it to Barbarian)*(This may vary)*   
 2. Armor *(Generally selling armor makes me money far faster then selling weapons)*  
3.Set rarity to Legendary   

**Your Screen should now look similar to mine**  
[\(Screenshot 2\)](http://imgur.com/J5oOchQ) 

**Now what?**  

Good question, but there are a number of ways to make money from here. If you don't have a lot of capital still try this method for practice but method 2 or 3 will be better for you.  
*Sometimes* this method requires more time to sell items but the return on them can be freakin' huge and totally worth giving up an auction slot for a day.  

1. [Check out this most popular items list](http://diablo.somepage.com/popular/items), I memorized a lot of items on here because they tend to sell the fastest and usually maintain a steady price. Plus you can really hit it big here if you snipe a popular item with good stats.

**Here is an example of why it is so important to know your items and the stats they can spawn with.**  
Let's use Inna's Temperance as the example item here. It is a very popular item and over the days I've seen the prices on it vary quite a bit. When I first started looking at it, it was a steady 350k-400k for just a normal stat Inna's Temperance. I'm assuming other people in the market
noticed that as well seeing as how it's flooded with these and the price has dropped by almost 50%.   

[\(Screenshot 3\)](http://imgur.com/rMwpDOn)  

Remember when I said the right stats will make you more gold? Well a few days ago I missed an Inna's Temperance for 200k which had 90 Strength on it. The moment I realized that was worth a ton
I tried to buy it but poof it was gone, someone beat me to it. Look at the price difference 90 strength makes.  

[\(Screenshot4\) ](http://imgur.com/44jInDh) 

Keep going through the list of popuar items for each class, I understand typing in each individual item sucks but if you put in the work you'll eventually have it pay off. Plus I've been doing it long enough to where I know what items I like to check on every few hours.  

**I didn't find any good deals for the popular items what should I do?**  
2. Try out my next favorite method. With the same search settings as I stated above:    
Instead of typing in a specific item and checking its prices, you're going to look for cheap items that you can sell fast for at least double of what you spent.  
**I recommend this over method 1 to anyone who doesn't have a lot of gold to invest. Don't worry that will change soon though!**  

Okay so you have your search settings all set up and you have your buyout arrow pointing up so you see the cheapest items.  
Your screen should look similar to this.  
[\(Screenshot5\)](http://imgur.com/j63ALjj)    

Look for any items here that are selling for 2500-5000 a nice tip is that if you see the same items over and over and over again, generally
they aren't worth buying. I see those same belts every single day at the same prices, I never really buy them unless the price is just absurdly low.   
 
**Scroll through the market, do you see any items that pop out at you?**   
For example look at this Giant Skull, *we can tell it could be a potential buy because it is surrounded by a bunch of low tier cheap items.*
[\(Screenshot6\)](http://imgur.com/8m96BrS)   
**Lets check the market to see if that would be a good buy.**  

[\(ScreenShot7\)](http://imgur.com/j7LkNDI)  
Sure is! What a snipe! It's not the biggest profit but hey man it's a start!  The next cheapest Giant Skull was 19k gold.  

Now here is another fork in the road  
**1. Do you want to sell this item as a quick profit of probably 11k gold?**   
*OR*  
**2. Did it happen to have good stats and is potentially worth billions?**  

Lets hope for #2 as we search the market.  

Go back to your stash and look at that beautiful item you sniped for next to nothing.  
136 strength and 23 Intelligence? Might not be the best stats, lets just check to be sure.  
Go back to the Search tab and search for a giant skull with Preferred Stats of 130 str  
What do you know a 130+ str giant skull sells for a lot of gold!  
**(I didn't get a screenshot but it was 350k for the cheapest.)**  

**Well now what do I do? Should I sell it for 300k gold?**
Let's think about this for a minute, how do other helms such as a rare, compare to this?
*We're doing this to find out if its worth selling a Giant Skull for such a high price, if it can beat similar helms in its level range it may be worth trying.*  
**So lets go back to our search tab and compare**  

I'm setting the Level cap to 52 (Giant Skull level) and setting the rarity to ALL. Because it is a high str item and basically only barbs will want STR I will leave the ""Barbarian"" setting alone.  
Here is a picture of my search settings  
[\(Screenshot8\)](http://imgur.com/QpHNAKQ)  


**Now take a look at those search results.**  
As you can see the average helm with this much str sells for at minimum 350k  
[\(Screenshot9\)](http://imgur.com/pLA7Tox)  

**Lets get more specific what happens if I add the ""Has Sockets"" to stats?**  
Well look at that, those prices are nuts.  
[\(Screenshot10\)](http://imgur.com/tk8RdEw) 

 See that giant skull for 50k? It really screws up the market, makes me nervous that is is there really.  
[\(Screenshot11\)](http://imgur.com/QpHNAKQ)  

Why would I be nervous? Well, I'm not the first one to think of this method of trading and that guy might have been trying to do exactly what I'm doing now and it didn't work for him.  

Here is another fork in the road and it's a risky one that has potential to pay off huge.    

**1. Should I buy that other Giant Skull for 50k and set a new market price?**  
*OR*  
**2. Should I try to sell MY Giant Skull for 42k and hope it sells before that one?**  

Well I'm gonna say screw it and buy his Giant Skull as well.* I want to essentially elimiante my competor so people think my helm is the cheapest on the market.*  
Plus if this works I'm going to make a killing all because I was patient.  

Let's go back to see what these stat Giant Skulls are worth again.
At minimum 350k  
[\(Screenshot12\)](http://imgur.com/Ugttvfy)  

Well the Giant Skull I paid 50k for has worse stats than the one I paid 8k for. So I'm going to try to sell it faster at a lower price.  
**The sad part is the Giant Skull for 350k has 39 vit.**  
For a barb (*Which is who we will be selling this to*) a helm with STR + VIT is very important. So I can't really compete with that.  


**Now I have to price this helm around that guys Giant Skull.**
*Would someone pay 50k less for a helm without vit?*  
If you are shopping for a 300k gold helm, you could probably afford a 350k helm. So I'm going to say no.  
I'd say 75k-100k cheaper would personally make me consider taking the cheaper helm.  
My better Giant Skull will be posted for 245k  
I'll put the one I bought for 50k up for 225k  

**Are these going to sell at that price?**  
Honestly man it's possible, but I doubt I'll get them to sell for that in a day.  
I just personally haven't been playing long enough to know if this is an item that people use frequently.  
I may have to knock 75k-100k off the prices to get a sale but it will happen eventually. If you truly want to get rid of the item you could
sell the Giant Skull you purchased for 8k and sell it for 20k and move on with your life.   


Turns out that 50k Giant Skull is a Legacy item as well. I've hit it big with legacy items before. See below for an example. Wanderlust is a legacy item I sniped.

**The third and last method of the way I trade!**  
It's essentially the same as method 2, just a more specific way of getting items.  

Go back to your original search settings  
[\(Screenshot13\)](http://imgur.com/qFBn4An)  

**Sometimes doing an overall search of EVERY item isn't the best way to find a great buy.**  

1. Click the **""All Armor Item Types""** tab and look at the drop down menu.  

[\(Screenshot14\)](http://imgur.com/59Xb9C9)  

2. Don't be like Drake, start at the top and work your way to the bottom of the list. Select Amulet. 

3. Click search and look at what pops up  
[\(Screenshot14\)](http://imgur.com/3qIKqXk)  

By narrowing it down to just Amulets you can see some awesome deals. Look at Traveler's Pledge, would that be worth buying? Let's check.  
[\(Screenshot15\)](http://imgur.com/DXQiTS0)
**Yes! That is an excellent buy, I could easily sell that for a profit.**  

[\(Screenshot16\)](http://imgur.com/evdedpf)  
**While taking screenshots and typing this stuff out, I lost the item to someone else. You have to act fast and sometimes buy first research later.**  

Keep repeating steps 1-3 for each category and hopefully you will find a good item worth selling. **Don't forget to skim the pages! Sometimes you can find an item for 200,000 gold and it will sell for a 1.5 million! I've found a few of those!**  

**Here are some examples of awesome trades I made with these methods:**  
[Example1](http://imgur.com/5vNmMv4)  
[Example2](http://imgur.com/oyrmO44)  
[Example3](http://imgur.com/g7vI3cc)




**Questions/Concerns:**  
**""I have far more gold then you bloozntooz these methods aren't worth my time!""**  
That's cool man, I just started playing again after a 4 month break, I only had 100k gold now I've got 4 million after 5 days of playing. My methods are for people who are struggling.  

**Why waste my time on this when I could just spend $4 and be worth 100mill?**    
Some people don't want to spend real money. Don't complain that there is nothing left to do in the game when you took the easy route to wealth. Getting rich by putting in a ton of work was the best part of d2 for me.  

**I'm not finding good items on the auction house. How am I supposed to profit?**  
The cool part of these methods is that you don't need to find a ""good"" item on the auction house. You just need to find an item worth more than you paid. If you spend 5000 gold on an item worth 30k, sell it at market price (30k) or just below and it will be gone in less than an hour. Do that 10 times a day and you make a decent amount of money. Eventually you will get lucky and get an item for 10k that sells for 300k. Think of it like fishing, everyone wants to catch a big ass fish but you're usually still satisfied when you catch something smaller.

**I have more questions/can you explain something further?**

Attack Rating. There was nothing more frustrating than having an Assassin clearing normal and nightmare no problem only to miss every single enemy in Hell. My attack rating is four billion. My stats say I have a 95% chance to hit. Why do I miss 90% of my hits and swing at the air for ten minutes when all I want to do is get three charges?

2. Scrolls and tomes - This one is obvious.

3. Ressurecting followers - You no longer have to take out a mortgage to get your stupid dork back.

4. Skill point saving - I could put all my points into this skill to make it easy for me, but then I won't even be able to kill Diablo in normal. Or I could save my points until I can access good skills, but I will only be able to auto attack until level 30.

5. Gems and runes - I would love to take advantage of this sweet gem or rune, but if I put it in a weapon now, I will lose it forever.

I can't afford to be ""good"" at D3.

I can't afford to spend the real money it would take to buy the items that would help me get through inferno. And, apparently, I can't *find* the items I need to get through inferno either. In a couple hundred hours of play I have found maybe two things that would place on maybe page 5 of an AH search for similar items. The legendary items I have found are laughable. Several have been worse than the very worst version of the item on the AH, and were just scrapped for mats.

Since the gold sale patch, nothing I have sells in the AH. Why would anyone need my crappy page 5 or 10 item when, for $10, they can buy a page 1 or 2 item?

Since this change I have gone from being able to afford the challenge of playing inferno, the ridiculous repair costs, the struggle to creep up the quality of gear for just a bit more survivability or DPS to inch along, even considering the shitty drops I get. It wasn't awesome but it was good enough and fun. An actual challenge.

Now, there are hardly any people in public inferno games, minus decked out farming barbs that don't give a crap about co-op play. The AH has become a circle jerk of farmers and people with enough disposable income to not care about dropping $100 to gear up a toon.

It became very apparent this week as to what Blizzard's intentions likely are with inferno. Inferno is where they make their money. It struck me as odd early on how easy it was to level. If you know what you are doing, you can get to 60 in no time. And you will find a nice challenge in A1 inferno. Enough to lure you in and ease you into the repair costs... gently break it to you that you need vastly better gear... then WHAM! Act 2... I was fortunate enough to hit this before you could buy gold. My current kit cost me roughly 1.5-2mil to assemble. Each piece costs about that now...

Maybe I am just whining, I dunno. Maybe the decade of waiting for it built some unrealistic expectations, not sure. But it is a damn shame and I hope gaming doesn't continue down this path. Because nothing good can come from equating dollars with skill.

The rest of the game is fun enough to keep playing, and worth the $60 I paid for it. It's not the epic, tiered challenge I had hoped for. But it will be fun spending a month or so bringing up one of each class to 60. But after that, unless something changes, I think I will put D3 away and finally write Blizzard off as another great company, finally ruined by money men and women.

**TL:DR** Money does not equal skill in gaming. Take your fake money buying and your AH and shove it, Blizzard.

**Edit:** A couple things to clear up some confusion. When I am talking about the AH, I am not talking about the RM AH in terms of buying items for money. I think that is retarded, but that has been a part of D3 longer than buying gold, and the problems I am seeing line up exactly with the advent of being able to purchase gold. So, to be clear, I am talking about the very recent addition of being able to buy in game gold, and the affects this has had on the Gold AH. In essence there is no longer a Gold AH, but just a RM AH. Because the effects of RM are now end to end in the system.

Also, what you did prior to this happening really isn't valid anymore. Yes, prior to being able to buy gold, I was making progress fine. And a lot less people were bitching as well.

To the people saying that if people can't do X or Y then they must suck, one could just as easily say you spend too much time playing video games. Personal judgments really aren't necessary and just invalidate anything else you have to say.",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,1342987873.0,,,True,t3_wz2q5,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/wz2q5/giving_up_on_inferno_and_the_ah_and_heres_why/,

Does anyone have any Diablo 3 tips they'd like to share, to save new people joining the game some hassle?




I'll start... In general, you want to be using the highest damaging weapon you have come across even if that weapon isn't really for your class. Say it's a melee weapon, and you're a ranged class.

All of your abilities will still work the same way no matter what weapon you use, and the damage your abilities do is partially based on the damage of the weapon in your hand/hands. 

Your ranged attacks will still work as ranged, even if you have a melee weapon equipped. ",,False,self,t5_2qjhk,False,,,True,t3_tr7ui,http://www.reddit.com/r/diablo3/comments/tr7ui/lets_share_our_helpful_diablo_tips/,

b) The concept of [desire lines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desire_path) or desire paths -- these are indicators of how people *actually are* doing something, rather than how you would *like* them to do something.

In creating D3, it's pretty clear that they added those two concepts together -- people *are* buying and selling D2 items for cash, and so our new Diablo game should support that way of playing. 

Do they make money from it?  Sure.  They're still a business, no one complains about Riot selling crap for LoL because they make money, no one is (yet) complaining that Dota 2 will allow users to buy other user's mods from the Steam Workshop, etc.  There's nothing wrong with making money^1.

But Blizzard didn't just pull the idea of the RMAH out of their ass as a way to make cash -- they looked at how the long term customers were playing Diablo 2, and tried to support that mode of play.  

If that's not for you, fine.  I'm not particularly enjoying the game, but I didn't particularly enjoy D2 after the first playthrough either.   If you hate the game, it's still been less than 30 days, you can still get a refund.  

Just don't pretend you're coming up with some deep, insightful counterpoint to Blizzard when you accuse them of gouging the player with the RMAH -- they didn't start with the buying and selling items for cash, the D2 community did.
