1365987462.0,135,self.fantasybaseball,1ccxzl,[Discussion]- Some Players that Might Help You - (Original Content),Ezen3000,150,15,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1ccxzl/discussion_some_players_that_might_help_you/,"Not sure if this type of stuff is allowed her, and I anticipate being downvoted...  but I was bored and decided to put this together and maybe help a few people out with some waiver wire adds. These players are owned in less than 30 percent of ESPN leagues and could help out - some short term, some long term. I tried to give 1 for each position (minus relief pitching), and if this is in fact allowed here, and if it is positive enough maybe I will try again next week. Hope this helps you out, and you enjoy it. If it wasn't allowed here, it doesn't help you out, or you don't enjoy it - I apologize in advance...

**1B - [Chris Carter (HOU)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29486/chris-carter)** (11.5 Percent): Based on his career MLB numbers (minus the 2013 campaign), the .289 AVG &amp; .600 SLG are unsustainable. In the bigs, prior to 2013, Carter has hit just .214 and slugged .425. While the average has flirted with the [Mendoza Line](http://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Mendoza_Line), he has provided plenty of pop - think 2012 Mark Reynolds (.221/.429).

So why add him? He may have finally figured it out. Carter has hit as many as 39 homers in a single season, and hit 28 between AAA and the majors last season. While his 2013 AVG and SLG are unsustainable, there is hope that they don't dip to his MLB career numbers as he is a career .281 hitter in the minors (A-AAA), and slugged .537 during that time. 

Already 1B eligible he is 3 games away from OF eligibility in standard ESPN leagues.

**2B - [Stephen Lombardozzi](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/31996/stephen-lombardozzi) (WAS)** (0.2 Percent): This is a speculation move, as [Danny Espinosa](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/5912/danny-espinosa) was forced to leave Sunday's game with a wrist injury. Lombardozzi hit .273 in 384 ABs for the National in 2012, and saw significant playing time when **[Ian Desmond](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29646/ian-desmond)** was forced to miss time between July and August. Should Espinosa be forced to miss any significant amount of time - which as of now is unlikely - he would make for a good add.

**SS - [Jhonny Peralta (DET)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/5527/jhonny-peralta)** (27.5 Percent): A lot of owners are searching the waiver wire for a replacement for the next 1 - 3 months waiting for **[Jose Reyes](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/3605/jose-reyes)** to come back from his ankle injury. This isn't a sexy acquisition that will win your league for you, but at the same time it won't lose your league. 

Amazingly, Pete Kozma is owned in more ESPN leagues than Peralta. The Detroit shortstop is coming off an extremely disappointing 2012, but looks rejuvenated, hitting 7th in one of, if not the, most potent lineups in baseball. After starting the season 5 for 25, with 1 RBI and 1 run he is 10 for 22 with 5 RBIs, 3 runs, and his first homer of the year. Over that stretch he also included 3 multi hit games!

**3B - [Chris Johnson (ATL)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29616/chris-johnson)** (6.2 Percent): ""The Other Guy in the Upton Deal,"" seems to be MLB Network's nickname for the third baseman. After hitting .281 with 15 homers, sluggin .451 and knocking 75 runs between Houston and Arizona in 2012 - he is more than just a throw in.

With **[Freddie Freeman](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/4586/freddie-freeman)**on the DL, Johnson has been logging time at both first and third, needing just 4 more appearances to add 1B eligibility in ESPN Leagues. On the downside, Freeman's injury has created more ABs than initially speculated for Johnson. So Freeman's return (late April) could put a halt to the constant flow of ABs. Should Johnson continue to hit right handed pitching (.400 on the year and a .286 3 year MLB average), he could force the issue and take more ABs against righties from the lefty, **[Juan Francisco](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/29601/juan-francisco)** (.321 vs RHP in 2013 &amp; .261 from 2010-2012). 

**OF - [Nate Schierholtz (CHC)](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/28815/nate-schierholtz)** (5.7 Percent): Schieroltz has been a solid contributor throughout his MLB career, but has struggled to find consistent ABs because of his .230 average against left handed pitching. Thus far in 2013, he is hitting .355 with 7 Runs, 1 HR, 4 RBIs and 2 Steals. He obviously won't be able to keep the average there but is capable of flirting with .300 and hitting 15-20 HRs and driving in 80 runs, as he is slotted into the 5 spot for the Cubs.

He will continue to see the majority of the starts against right handed pitching for the Cubs, giving way to **[Scott Hairston](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/5401/scott-hairston)**, but could eventually garner more ABs vs LHP, if Hairston (1/10) continues to struggle in 2013. 

**SP - [Tony Cingrani (CIN)](http://firstinning.com/players/Tony-Cingrani-a/)** (0.3 Percent): With **[Johnny Cueto](http://www.rotoworld.com/player/mlb/4660/johnny-cueto)** hitting the DL with a lat strain  Cingrani will earn a call up to the show, after being pulled from Sunday's start after striking out 5 in just 2 innings! On the young season [Cingrani](http://firstinning.com/players/Tony-Cingrani-a/) has 14.1 IP in 3 starts (including his cut short recent start), and been dominant thus far striking out 26, allowing 3 hits and walking 5. In his 2012 taste of the majors he appeared 3 times, totaling 5 innings (1 ER, 9 Ks &amp; 2 BB). He will draw the light hitting Marlins on Thursday, against fellow rookie **[Jose Fernandez](http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/32567/jose-fernandez)**.


Please discuss. Feel free to suggest your players that haven't been included. Criticize anything you would like, but please try to keep it civil - the idea here is to help.

Let's talk fantasy baseball.",enosarris,113,10,238,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1ernmp/im_eno_sarris_from_fangraphs_lets_talk_fantasy/,"Hello! I used to spend all my time at my day job on a forum just like this, talking fantasy baseball all day. Somehow I lucked out enough to make that my day job now. I manage the fantasy blog at [FanGraphs](www.fangraphs.com/fantasy), and as a member of the Baseball Writer's Association, I also interview players, mostly about stats. You can find me on twitter at [@enosarris](www.twitter.com/enosarris) or see my collected writings updated at [enosarris.com](www.enosarris.com).

Of course now that my day job is baseball, I sneak in blog posts about beer when I'm supposed to talking fantasy. It wouldn't surprise you, then, than I've got plans to open a spinoff of FanGraphs called BeerGraphs (on twitter [@BeerGraphs](www.twitter.com/beergraphs)) to write about the analytics of beer. That should launch in the next couple of weeks.

If you're going to do something, do it all the way nerdy amirite.

Anyway, I'd be happy to answer your questions about any of the following: baseball, fantasy baseball, beer, music, traveling, traveling for music, and fantasy baseball. I'll answer all sorts of fantasy baseball questions, but as always, the details of your league (settings, roster sizes, other waiver wire and roster information) are very important to the quality of your answer. Oh, and also how many beers I've had.

So let's start this early (for me, I'm on the west coast), and I'll drop by at 1pm ET today to kick it off. 

---- That's it for today! Maybe we'll send over another RotoGraphs writer for you guys to pepper. That was fun, I'll recommend it to them. Also, thanks to the downvoters for not showing up in the thread, at least as far as I could tell. ;) -----",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1369168326.0,,,True,t3_1ernmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1ernmp/im_eno_sarris_from_fangraphs_lets_talk_fantasy/,

I've recommended this sub to friends that play, and they all agreed that they had to sift through too many posts of this nature before they were able to find anything useful.  This might just be me, but I would really like to see this subreddit consolidate the number of posts specific to individual fantasy teams, and post more content relavent to all users.

Here's what I propose:
A daily trade thread (obviously we already have this), a daily start/sit thread, and a daily ROS thread.  I know a lot of comments get buried in the trade thread but with some effort I'm sure we can answer everyone's question.

I might be alone in thinking this, but I really believe that we could make this sub a lot better than it currently is.

1372281292.0,52,self.fantasybaseball,1h4v6j,We are the regulars at /r/Sabermetrics. Let's look under the hood of baseball and analyze some sweet sweet stats.,NextLevelFantasy,60,8,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1h4v6j/we_are_the_regulars_at_rsabermetrics_lets_look/,"Whats up gang. We are the mods and regulars of /r/sabermetrics, a lovely land filled with discussion of advanced baseball statistical analysis. The mainstream stats are simply not accurate ways to judge a player's true value, and so explains our lust for wOBA, UBR, UZR, FIP, xFIP, SIERA to name a few. 

I would highly recommend the [Fangraphs Library]( http://www.fangraphs.com/library/) if you want to get a better feel for all the stats.

There are still a couple topics that are largely unpolished such as fielding metrics, but overall there is a vast amount of knowledge that should prove as the textbook for placing value and expectations on players. Obviously your gut will always get some say in the matter, but it is generally smart to start off with proper understanding of a player’s statistics overall and relative to historical trends/outside factors/scouting reports. I’m not saying staring at a player's statistical DNA is the be all and end all, but data itself is the fruit and vegetables of the baseball food pyramid of understanding. 

Sabermetrics attempts to determine who is getting lucky and unlucky, the effects of environment on players across all leagues, minor league call-up expectations, and how to assign proper value and relevance of all this big bad numbers.

Regression to the mean, relative to sample sizes and batted ball data (ex: BABIP, xBABIP, LD%, IFFB%, HR/FB, popup rate, z-contact, etc.) will certainly help answer some of those questions while dictating what the future *probably* holds for a player. But the potential is limitless and the true value is that it allows you to sift through the white noise, and take advantage of other people’s emotions and overreacting. 

Introductions of some sabr folks contributing:

* /u/NextLevelfantasy - Yours truly, the Commish of /r/SultansOfStats. This love affair with sabermetrics all began in an effort to improve my fantasy baseball game. Over the years I developed a pretty well-rounded smattering of knowledge and I’m currently developing a fairly complex projections algorithm. 

* /u/Doctor_Underdunk –  I'm a PhD candidate in both biostatistics and epidemiology. One project I'm working on is building a Bayesian model that allocates credit for runs fairly, sort of like a weighted mix of runs scored and runs batted in. As a result, I've become very familiar with many advanced offensive statistics.

* /u/TwoTacoTuesdays – TwoTacoTuesdays is an A's fan and a writer for [The Hardball Times]( http://www.hardballtimes.com/). He desperately wants to be able to call himself a jack-of-all-trades, but most of his experiences lies with the math behind advanced stats and PITCHf/x analysis.

* /u/dmack4 – I study psychology and statistics at Rutgers University, where I will be writing an honors thesis on how the sabermetric movement has changed the way we perceive ""success"" for baseball players. Also, I write/podcast for HighHeatStats.com, which was born from the Baseball-Reference Blog.

* /u/SonnySideUp - Sonnysideup took a few statistic classes in college but is otherwise entirely self taught, and spends an inordinate amount of time scouring fangraphs, brooks baseball, milb, and baseball-reference for information about players, mostly so he can dominate his keeper league, but also because he loves baseball.

* /u/boilface

* /u/Colonel_Rhombus

* /u/HughRistik

*Obviously this post will fade off the front page soon enough, but we will make an effort to answer every question even if it takes a couple days...So let's get this party started.*

*Feel free to ask literally anything - Questions on specific players and general sabermetrics concepts alike are all welcome, however I hope some of you take this time to learn how to fish (however that phrase goes).*

-----------------------------------

*Edit: Grabbing a slice of pizza real quick, will be back and commenting in 5-10. Hopefully the rest of the sabr gang will wander in soon enough as well...I'll be here all night so ask away and feel free to argue with me, I love a good debate.*

1372081628.0,42,self.fantasybaseball,1gyusq,[Modpost] Response and Continuation of Last Week's Discussion: Improving r/Fantasybaseball,KTrout17,47,5,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1gyusq/modpost_response_and_continuation_of_last_weeks/,"It seems that there have been a quite a bit of discussion around here lately on a number of things, so I thought I'd take a moment to clarify my thoughts on a few things, and open up for discussion to hear your feedback on the state of the community around here. 


* *Daily Posts vs. Individual Posts*

I will not be enforcing a change involving the removal of individually posted questions about trades, add/drops, or keepers. While I see a lot of value in the daily posts, and fully support them, I still believe that allowing the community to have more focused discussions is important. Upvote good content. Report submissions that don't belong. Individual posts still have value, and can provide some great information if you happen to own a player involved and want to get a sense of people's thoughts on value and projections. 

The one change I *do* support on this topic, is some better moderation of posts that don't include enough details. Posting questions about a trade or a player to add, without posting your league format, standings, roster, etc., is useless to the suibmitter and the community. So I'll be looking to remove posts that lack the basic details necessary, and also removing posts whose headlines don't explain the topic (e.g. ""What do you think about..."", ""Should I do this?""). Include the topic in the headline, include the details, and you'll get good feedback and advice. If anyone has a suggestion on a good ""standard"" to use for individual trade &amp; add/drop posts, I can clarify a bit in the sidebar, but I agree we can keep things cleaner around here in that regard.


* *Automation of Daily Threads*

I'd love to have a way to use a bot to automatically post daily trade/start-sit/ROS threads. Currently, I'm not aware of anyway to automate this. I've discussed with several other users, including the creator of the automoderator bot, and one of the admin, Deimorz, and last I heard there's nothing I can hijack to accomplish this just yet. I believe it can be done, but I don't have the java skills to work on getting a bot to handle something like this personally. If anyone else here does, please feel free to jump in and see what you can do, I think it'd be great to get up and running.

* *CSS Features*

Many subreddits are drowning in fancy CSS features. Some of them are very useful, some of them look great. Many of them remind me of Myspace. I don't think anyone here really wants Little Wayne to start playing or glitter around Prospect posts every time they come here, but there may be some useful features I can put in place. I don't enable CSS at the office, so I don't see much of it, but I'm familiar enough with CSS to make changes. If anyone has any suggestions for useful CSS they've seen elsewhere, just let me know. I'm in contact with moderators and admins from across the site quite regularly, and would be glad to reach out and see if I can poach some of their tweaks.

* *The Sidebar*

I have no idea how many of you actually use the sidebar here. But I've done my best to keep it concise, and valuable, I think there's some very useful links included there(daily ballpark weather reports/starting lineups, who to follow on twitter, links to the best podcasts, etc.). **If anyone has any feedback on restructuring, adding, or clarifying anything there, I'd love to keep that as good a reference as possible.** We have some Sabermetric guys stopping by this week to discuss players and how to use different stats, and I hope to have them provide a nice clean wiki on Sabermetrics 101 for the sidebar once the Q&amp;A is done.

* *Adding New Moderators*

I've been the lone moderator here for the last four years. I've seen this place grow from 50 users, to 1000, to 2500, to the 6500 we have today. Up until this year, there was really no need for any other mods, because there wasn't much to do, other than talk baseball and help each other out. With the community continuing to grow, having one or two more moderators to help out would be damn useful. It's busier, and some of the community is a bit feistier. I'm not looking for an Enforcer, or a Revolutionary. **I do not care to see strict, heavy moderation here**, this isn't r/helpmedobrainsurgery, it's r/fantasybaseball. Heavy moderation of a small sub whose focus is on a game is unneccessary. We're here to have fun and argue baseball. 

But if anyone would like to volunteer or nominate someone, I'll certainly put them into consideration. Mod experience is mildly useful, CSS experience is a bonus, but mostly I'd prefer to add users who are here consistently, who are level headed, empathetic, and in good standing with the community here.

* *Getting the most out of r/fantasybaseball*

If there are things we'd like to see more of here, I'd be glad to hear some feedback. More news and analysis definitely has value, especially call-ups, demotions, and analysis on players struggles/buy-lows/sell-highs, etc.

I've been very happy with the response from the recent Q&amp;A's we've had running, both from the community and from the writers who have been volunteering. If anyone has any thoughts on getting more out of those, please feel free to voice your thoughts, but I'll be looking to keep those running throughout the season as best I can.

- Individual questions are perfectly acceptable outside of the daily threads, but need clear headlines and basic details or will be removed.

- If you know java and know how to script a bot to post daily threads, let me know, I'd love to try and get something set up. Currently, not aware of a way to accomplish this.

- Addition of one or two new moderators. If you're interested, involved, and in good standing with the community, feel free to PM me and I'll put you in to consideration. Looking for Lenin's, not Stalin's.

Ask Me Anything.,zvsanders,48,5,175,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1fnm5v/im_zach_sanders_from_fangraphs_ask_me_anything/,"Howdy ho, everyone! As a fervent imgurian and occasional redditor, I was over the moon when presented with the opportunity to come hang out with you all today. 

Why should you listen to anything I have to say? Well, I’ve written for FanGraphs since late 2009, written some articles for ESPN.com, and been an expert guest on a national radio program. When I started at FanGraphs, I covered a variety of different fantasy beats, but I’ve since developed the daily Roto Riteup feature, as well as the site’s fantasy valuation system. You can find my assorting ramblings on twitter [@zvsanders] (http://www.twitter.com/zvsanders).

So, let’s get this started, and I’ll swing by at 13:00 EST and start answering questions. You can ask me anything about baseball, how I ended up getting paid to talk baseball, what it likes balancing real-life and internet life, why us writers hate you and your favorite player, or whatever else comes to your mind.
- - -

UPDATE: I'm taking a break to grab some food and rest my back. I'll come by again at around 16:00 EST and answer more questions, so feel free to keep 'em coming!

**THE END.** Thanks everyone for coming out. If you have any more questions, feel free to shoot me a quick note on twitter (I'm pretty good at getting back to people there).",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1370378794.0,,FLAIRNAME,True,t3_1fnm5v,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1fnm5v/im_zach_sanders_from_fangraphs_ask_me_anything/,
1367448907.0,41,self.fantasybaseball,1dihjd,Signs a trade offer is unfair (towards you),Overlord1317,52,11,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1dihjd/signs_a_trade_offer_is_unfair_towards_you/,"The epidemic of horrendously one-sided trade offers in this forum are astounding, and I'm sure they're only the tip of the iceberg.  I guess the current state of fantasy baseball is to send out ridiculous trade offers and hope one is accepted.  

Here are some warning signs the trade is unfair:

1.)You didn't put the trade proposal together.  While there are kind souls out there who look at your roster and design their trade around YOUR needs, it's not likely.  You should always keep in mind that you didn't think up the deal.


2.)You are giving up a first or second round pick and not getting a commensurate draft round pick in return.  This year, in particular, I saw a huge drop-off midway through the first round and then another huge drop off early in the third round or late in the second round, depending upon league size.  If you are trading a first or second round pick and not getting a pick from the equivalent round back, you're probably getting fucked.  I don't even need to look at the players involved to know that.


3.)You are getting multiple players of ""lower"" value and giving up one or more studs.  Two for one and more commonly three for two trades are often horribly one-sided, but this is not apparent at first glance.  This is also known as the ""trading down"" concept.  Don't do it unless it's an overwhelming package.  It's a bad idea to ""trade down"" because of the hidden cost/penalty of losing a roster spot.  Basically, you are locking up an additional slot that could be used to get, at worst, a replacement level player, at best a new prospect or interesting new player.  Roster spots are precious.  You don't want to lock them down unnecessarily.  

One wrinkle that even experienced players don't catch on to is that the shallower the league, the worse of an idea it is to ""trade down.""  This is because in shallow leagues the replacement level players are often pretty fucking good.  This means that the chances of all three of your players being meaningfully above replacement is likely pretty slim.  


4.)Are you trading for a closer?  You are probably getting ripped off.  There are only a handful of closers worth actually trading for, period.  Kimbrel, Chapman .. maybe a few others.  There is so much closer turnover that paying for saves is almost always a bad idea.  I bet that with decent speculative adds you could have at least two closers by the all star break in shallow leagues.  


5.)Are you trading someone who is doing poorly (particularly a starting pitcher in April) for someone who is red hot?  Probably a sign you're selling low and buying high.  Where were the players drafted?  I recently saw Alcides Escobar traded for Matt Cain.  What are the chances Alcides Escobar continues on his current torrid pace?  That Matt Cain (historically bad BABIP arguments aside) continues to be absolutely awful? 


6.)Players who are not significantly above replacement level HAVE NO TRADING VALUE.  Zero.  If a guy is marginally better or only arguably better then guys available for free, just remove him from the trade.  Pretend he isn't even included.  Because, frankly, he might as well not be.  

**all of the above is based, of course, upon injuries not coming in to play.  When you're playing guessing games as to when guys like Teieieieixeieiieira, Reyes, or Stanton might/will come back at full health, then who the hell knows.

1371579576.0,35,self.fantasybaseball,1glld6,"[Prospect Watch] Billy Hamilton, Trevor Bauer, Jameson Taillon and AJ Cole",the_clever_cuban,44,9,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1glld6/prospect_watch_billy_hamilton_trevor_bauer/,"**Trevor Bauer**

Bauer has made three starts in the majors this year. He has a 1-2 record with 11Ks and a 2.76 ERA. In the Minors he has pitched 10 games with a 3-2 record with 61Ks and a 3.84 ERA. The numbers look good but Bauer's big problem is his command. He is averaging 4.9BB/9IP which is what he needs to improve on.  The Indians could use the help in their rotation so expect to see Bauer up again in the near future and he could be up for good if he shows signs of improving his command(Last 3 games in the minors he has 8 walks in 17.2 innings so there problem is still looming) On the positive side however Bauer has fantastic stuff.  He has a plus fastball as well as an above average curve ball. He also can throw a slider and a change up but those still need some development and are not on the level of his other pitcher. If Bauer figures out his command he has ace potential but only time will tell if he will. Bauer should be owned in keepers, dynasty and deeper leagues because of his ace potential and figuring out his command is something that could come with slight adjustments. 


**Billy Hamilton**

Billy Hamilton is currently in AAA and is hitting .247/.307/.345 with 43 SB.  Hamilton is known as the fastest man in baseball. Last season he stole 155 bases between AA and AAA. The problem with Hamilton as shown by his average, on base percentage and strike out rate. He is striking out 20.3% of the time which is a problem for a player who would ideally fit as a leadoff man. If Hamilton is able to figure out his plate discipline and get on base more frequently he will hold a decent amount of value in fantasy. He has the type of speed that could single handedly win you the SB category in a season at the peak of his career. Unless Hamilton gets on a hot streak there is a chance that the Reds make the call up but with Choo doing well as a leadoff and in Center there is no immediate need. One other positive sign with Hamilton is his defense is improving. He originally started out at Short but was moved to the OF because his defense was not up to par. His defense has improved a lot and is no longer a reason to not make the call. He will not really contribute in any areas other than SB and Runs but with the numbers he could produce with his speed he is certainly worth a look. Hamilton should be owned in deep keepers/dynasty leagues simply because of his steal potential but other than that I would just keep a tab on him to see if he starts to get hot because if he does get called up he can provide solid steals immediately.


**AJ Cole**

Cole is currently pitching in A ball with a 4-2 record and a 4.16 ERA in 13 games pitched. One very good sign with Cole is that he has a high strike out rate and low walk rate. (He has 82 stoke outs and only 18 walks) The biggest concern with him is that his stuff isn't as commanding as other guys(Like Bauer) He has a plus fastball but lacks a serviceable second pitch which contributes to the fact that opposing hitters have a .261 average against him. He has games where he is masterful(Like his last game, 4 hits, 0ER, 2 BB and 10Ks) and then he has games where he is very hittable. The Nationals are hoping he is able to develop a second pitch to go along with his fastball and if he does he has the shot at being in the majors late 2014 or at the start of the 2015 season. Unless you are in a deep dynasty league and can afford to use a spot I would leave him as a FA and add him to your watch list to see if he can figure out a second pitch.


**Jameson Taillon**

 With the recent call up of Gerrit Cole Taillon is the best pitching prospect in the Pirates system. He was scratched from his most recent start but is listed as Day to Day so it is unknown at this time how serious the injury is. This year in 13 starts he holds a 3-5 record with a 2.89 ERA. He also has 77 Ks and 27 BB. Taillon has a Plus fastball as well as an above average curve and change up. If he can improve his command a bit he has the potential to be the #2 guy in Pittsburgh behind Gerrit Cole. While Taillons stuff isn't as good as Coles it is close and they should figure to be one of the best 1-2 punches in the league. Unless there are some more major injuries to the Pirates rotation don't expect to see Taillon in the majors this year but he could make a push to be in the rotation to start next season. With that he should be owned in dynasties and deep keepers but unless he gets promoted to AAA I don't think he will be able to contribute this year.

1363782420.0,36,self.fantasybaseball,1anq9q,Value picks inside and outside Yahoo's top 150,NextLevelFantasy,41,5,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1anq9q/value_picks_inside_and_outside_yahoos_top_150/,"Recently wrote a little diddy about high value picks based on ADP/yahoo's rankings. See the actual article [HERE](http://www.sonsofroto.com/articles/baseball/fantasy-baseball-2013-value-picks.html) if you'd like, but I pasted the text below so don't think I am scrounging for traffic (I don't own or run the site, but the guy who does lets me curse, write whenever the hell I want to, and invited me to the fantasy football conference in AC last August..so that is good enough for me)

***Value Picks Within Yahoo! Top 150***

* **Evan Longoria** (19) - Pretty black and white situation here. Longo is a perennial first round pick whose propensity for getting injured has dragged down his ADP. I’m not telling you he will stay healthy this year, but the price is right and the risk is well worth the reward.
I prefer him over an equally as injury prone Troy Tulowitzki and over Giancarlo Stanton and Adrian Beltre as well. Stantbeast is, well, he is a beast, but the phenom won’t steal bases and the rest of the Marlins won’t be creating many runs, so I will be passing on the price tag for an outfielder. But I digress, buying Longoria is like going all in with a Royal Flush draw on the river. 
 
* **Jose Reyes** (30) - My boy Jose is one year removed from a batting title, and will find himself leading off for a potentially dominant Toronto offense. Reyes will provide supreme production in the stolen base department as well as runs and average, and won’t exactly hurt you with mediocre power and RBI numbers for a leadoff hitter. My favorite ex-Met had more walks than strikeouts last year, which goes to show he is a natural with a bat in his hands (and is primed to put up massive stats).
 
* **Allen Craig** (53) - The stars have aligned and Craig is ready to bust out, as long as he can stay healthy. Yes that is a big if, but you have to assume some risk. Sitting at a prime 28 years old, Allen is fertile and fucking ready to put it all together. He will provide a pimp .300-plus batting average, 28-plus bomb potential, and run production that comes with hitting in the heart of an always imposing St. Louis lineup. 
 
* ~~**Chase Headley** (64) - Before you go any further, I am only recommending Chase to those in leagues that take OBP and/or OPS into account. A 28 year old in the peak of his career, Headley absolutely busted out last season. With the fences moving in I don’t expect heavy regression. Before you jump down my throat, I do believe a drop in home runs is coming, but doomsday prophecies are overblown. While the strikeouts are a bit heavy, he also draws a ton of walks and it feels like he finally got comfy in the big show. Would I reach? Not really. But if he falls in your lap, lick your chops and fearlessly draft the man.~~ Broken thumb, gotta assume the worst and stay away unless he falls sueeper deep and you can pop him in a dl slot. Own him on two teams already but will be avoiding Chase the rest of the draft season.
 
* **Aaron Hill** (67) - For those of you living under a rock, Hill had a surprisingly dominant season last year and finished up as the second most valuable 2B in the majors. Power, speed, average, and run production with solid peripherals, I am a believer especially with the Diamondbacks offense on the rise. Love him in the low-to-mid 60s this year.
 
* **Freddie Freeman** (73) - The injured left index finger that slowed him down the end of last season is supposedly healthy, and this beast of a man could do beautiful things in 2013. The Braves have a studly lineup and Freeman is the power first baseman of the future.  From what I can tell, there will always be somebody drafting Paul Goldschmidt super early this season, and I’m a big fan of Freeman as a value pick. I do like Goldy, but he is everyone's sleeper pick. Would rather get Freeman, Ike Davis, or Mark Trumbo later on. Shit, even Paul Konerko is a great buy at his ADP.
 
* **Austin Jackson** (91) - Coming in to his fourth season in the bigs, A-Jax has proven to be a steady contributor. After a rough 2011, he improved upon his BB/K ratio, saw a boost in power, and finally crossed that .300 threshold in batting average. If he swipes more bags, as Leyland is hoping for, Jackson could turn into a top 75 player with ease. 
 
* **Mark Trumbo** (135) - You will not get Trumbo this late unless you are drafting against a bunch of scrubs. He is a lock for 30-plus bombs as he enters his prime years. Underrated power bat, and will help you out with multi-position eligibility.
 
* **Carlos Santana** (79) - I have been a Santana fan ever since he entered the league. With a substantially improved Cleveland offense, this could be his breakout season. He has an incredible eye, and don’t forget about those 27 taters he hit in 2011. Super stud, especially in OBP leagues. I am a sucker for solid BB/K ratios and all the hype over the years wasn’t a bunch of hoopla. 
 
* **Ike Davis** (107) - Dude started off ice cold in 2012 but still ended up with 32 bops. He is a steal at the price although he has gone somewhat earlier in most drafts I have done so far. Nothing else to say here. Just cop an easy 30-plus home runs and thank me later. 
 
* **David Freese** (113) - Assuming the bruised ass bone is not a big deal, Freese could be a great mid-round option. He just signed a one-year deal, so he is playing for a contract as well. D-Free is a cheap third baseman whose price has not been inflated. So what can you expect? A .295 batting average and 25 four baggers. He is a less sexy Kung Fu Panda. 
 
* **Carl Crawford** (116) - He's a huge question mark as he is dealing with nerve irritation steming from the Tommy John surgery. If he can eventually brush it off and get healthy, Crawford could return to the five-cat producer we used to know. He won’t be putting up Tampa Bay numbers, but the Dodgers are stacked, he is only 31, and he is still an incredible natural athlete. Carl took live batting practice for the first time recently, but should still start the season off on the DL.  
 
* **Dan Uggla** (125) - Regression. Sometimes it burns you trying to chase the dragon, and other times it allows you to snag a heavy lumber swinger on the cheap. Uggla has stayed remarkably healthy in his seven years in the league, never logging less than 619 plate appearances. The 2012 numbers are alarming there is no doubt about that, but he is built like an ox and I am willing to bet that those HR/FB rates will grow once again. Considering the imposing lineup in Atlanta, Uggla could put up monster numbers if he transforms back into the streaky, but dominant, Danny boy we know and love.
 
* **Salvador Perez** (130) - Still a baby, but Sally can stroke and is an even better buy if you think the Royals offense will bounce back. Eric Hosmer is having a great spring, Moose Tacos (Mike Moustakas) got hit with a terribly unlucky BABIP in the second half of 2012 and will improve, and Lorenzo Cain might even stay healthy. Perez has the skills to be a steady .300 hitter, and is an elite buy in keeper/dynasty leagues considering the success he had at the not so ripe age of 22. 
 
* **Ben Revere** (144) - The Phillies made one of the most underrated moves in the offseason with Revere. He is a young speedster with a very solid glove. While most people warn you against paying for steals, Benny is a lock for 40-plus swipes and could even boost your batting average. He is a no-no in leagues that use SLG or OPS, having never hit a home run in the bigs and lacking in the other XBH departments as well. I’m buying at this price though.
 
* **Alejandro De Aza** (140) - Slurped De Aza last year, slurping him again this year. Alejandro won’t carry your squad, but he is a perfect glue guy who can provide a little bit of everything. Maybe not so much power, but I respect the man’s game and he is peaking at a plump 28 years old as well.
 
**Value Picks Outside Yahoo! Top 150**

* **Wil Middlebrooks** (155) - Another popular sleeper pick this season, every league will have a Wil lover who takes him too early. However, if he hangs around, then gobble the youngster up. Safe option? Not particularly, especially since the recent wrist injury is a bit unsettling. He mashed in his first trip to the show, but the sample size is too tiny to really get all worked up. Solid risk/reward buy.
 
* **Jonathan Lucroy** (170) - I fucking lust over Johny Loocs. In a season where it seems like there are countless catchers on the rise, Lucroy might be my favorite for the price. He has improved every season and if it weren’t for broken hand in 2012, people would be all over his nuts with me. A Ryan Braun suspension could put a damper on his production, but Lucroy in the mid-to-late rounds is a gem. Expect well-rounded stat production.
 
* **Lorenzo Cain** (192) - Zo is the definition of injury prone, and is already dealing with a hand injury this spring. However, he is supremely talented and coming into his prime years. Don’t complain to me if he misses a substantial amount of time again, but if he can put together a full season, 20 bombs and 30 swipes is doable. 
 
* **Justin Morneau** (198) - Recently got J-Mo for $11 in a 20-man auction league and people were ragging on me. Apparently, I joined a league with a bunch of morons. The lefty’s brain is healthy for the first time in years and there is a very good chance we see 30-plus home runs out of the man. While it is never a good idea to read too much into spring training numbers, he is on a roll so far. Dirt cheap tag for Morneau this year. Feel free to reach as well if you need a 1B later on. Fuck it, plan on having Morneau as your starting first basemen.
 
* **Everth Cabrera** (205) - Yes the potential PED suspension is a bit worrisome, and unfortunately I don’t have any additional light to shine on the situation. All I know is when he hits the field, you are getting one of the most dangerous base runners in the game. Everth blew everybody out of the water last year in regards to SB/PA including the chosen one, Mike Trout, and Michael Bourn. 
 
* **Brandon Belt** (239) - Who are we to shun this man for not living up to his hype when he is still only 24 and has not been given a true full season of opportunity? He has power and speed and is locked in as the starting first baseman for the Giants. The stars may finally be aligning, and the cherry on top is the fact that he is mashing this spring. 
 
* **Andrelton Simmons** (240) - The buzz is out there, so don’t think you are the only one who is eyeing this young SS. The Bravos are planning on batting him leadoff, so serious run production is on the horizon. The sample size for his somewhat respectable stats during his first run in the show is small. Am I going to get all giddy starting Simmons? Not particularly, but if you are deep in a draft and still missing a SS, then he is a godsend.
 
* **Starling Marte** (253) - Speaking of young stud muffins, Marte is a very solid late-round speed option. He might not do your batting average any favors, but has some decent pop for a leadoff hitter and also has the potential to swipe 30-plus bags. The 24-year-old may hit some rough patches while adjusting to the bigs. Still, I envision an exciting 15/30 campaign and the Pirates are excited to see what he can do as well.
 
* **Colby Rasmus** (260) - I have always been a sucker for sleepers after the buzz dies down. Rasmus had countless fans, but has been pretty quiet since entering the league. He is going to damage your batting average, but showed some flashes of power last season and could be serviceable if he puts it all together and contributes in that Blue Jays lineup I love oh so much. A major roadblock is on the horizon, as he has shown absolutely no comfort or power at the plate since returning from a shoulder injury. With Anthony Gose an Rajai Davis waiting for a shot, Rasmus could miss out on an incredible opportunity if he doesn’t pull his shit together. Monitor the situation, but I still think Rasmus is a smart buy late in the draft. You need a couple roster spots open for streaming/waiver pickups anyway, so if he turns out to be a bust, it won’t kill you. 
 
* **Domonic Brown** (322) - Let’s keep going down the rabbit hole. Dom Brown is making a case for more plate appearances this spring and could be a solid contributor in deeper leagues if given a shot (even after Delmon Young returns). His batting average will burn a bit, but if given the opportunity, Brown could pleasantly surprise Phillies fans.
 
* **Nolan Reimold** (324) - Another injury prone dude who never put up the numbers people expected, Reimold is a solid late round sleeper. Supposedly, Nate McLouth is the starting left fielder, and Wilson Betemit is penciled in as the DH. But if Nolan can stay healthy and swing a heavy oak, then he could surprise us this upcoming season. Granted it was only 16 games, but he absolutely dominated before getting hurt last year. 
 
* **Jon Jay** (331) - JJ could be my favorite late-round draft pick of the year. He is not flashy by any means, but has hit .300 in 1,000-plus career plate appearances, and stole a decent hunk of bags last season. Jay will most likely leadoff for the Cards and is the perfect late-round glue guy for those needing some outfield depth.   
 
* **Mitch Moreland** (532) - So let me get this straight. Moreland is a 27-year-old coming into his fourth year in the bigs, who has shown solid power and improvement, is slated to be the starting 1B on the Rangers, but isn’t getting much love. Me likey. 

*And was edited out of the article for some reason, but:*

* **Justin Smoak** (768) – The Smoak monster is going undrafted in a large majority of leagues (and he should be left as waiver wire fodder in most) but could be a great pick in very deep leagues. He swings a heavy lumber and could be surprisingly productive if he retains the starting gig at first. He is a shittier Adam Dunn who will hurt your average, but the pop is real.

Just add your team names to the top of the draft board and then add the same names in line 300 of the top 250 list, then as the players are drafted use the ""F. Last"" naming convention.

Castellanos is the top prospect int he Tigers system and will most likely be called up soon. He currently is in AAA and hitting .303 with 11 HRs and 42 RBIs. His defense will be average at best but he has the potential to be a plus plus hitter with above average power which is very valuable in Fantasy. The Tigers don't have huge need offensively at the moment but adding another quality bat to the lineup is always something they will do if possible. I would expect him to be up in the next couple of weeks and will immediately get a lot of at bats. While he won't bat high in the order(doesn't have much speed) he still will have a chance to score some runs, hit for a decent average and of course drive in some of the guys hitting ahead of him. He should be owned in dynasties and keepers and without a doubt is worth a look in redraft leagues.

**Byron Buxton**

Buxton is making a great case to be the top prospect in all of baseball next year. He recently was promoted to High A and between A and High A he has a .340 average with 8 HRs 58 RBIs and 33 SB. He and Miguel Sano give the Twins some hope for the future because of the talent they have coming up in the future. Buxton has legitimate 5 tool ability and could be a game changer. While it is still very early in his career and development if he keeps hitting the ball like he has been he will be very hard to ignore. He still has probably one to two more years before he reaches the majors but he has a shot at making it to AA by the end of the year if he keeps this up. He should be owned in al dynasties and is worth a look in keepers but has no value in re-draft leagues.

**Javier Baez**

Baez is the top prospect in the Cubs farm system right now. He is currenty in High A and is hitting .272 with 17 HRs 57 RBIs and 9 SB. His main asset is his power which has plus potential. He will never hit for a fantastic average but his power ability makes up for some of that. The Cubs are in an interesting situation to see what they end up doing with Baez because they already have Castro at short. Baez also has been pretty terrible on the defensive side of the ball so that may also add to why they are taking their time with Baez. Wherever Baez ends up hitting or playing he will be a strong power hitter who can really help you team. He won't be up this year and will possibly make a push at some point next year so he should be owned in keepers and dynasties but has no value in re-draft leagues.

**Jonathan Singleton**

Singleton is the top prospect in the Astros system and is also the top 1B prospect right now. He started off the year suspended but is now in AAA. On the season he is hitting .263 with 6 HRs and 17 RBIs. The average has yet to show up but he has shown his good power potential. He has the ability to be an above average hitter as well as have above average power which should be valuable in fantasy. There have been some rumors about him coming up this year but only time will tell since the Astros can take their sweet time with prospects since they do not have the need to compete right now. He is worth a look in all leagues and should be owned in keepers/dynasties without a doubt. 

**Robert Stephenson**

Stephenson is currently in A ball with a 2.97 ERA to go along with 85 K's and only 17 BB. He has a plus plus fastball as well as an above average curve and an average changeup. There were concerns about his control coming into the year but he seems to have answered those questions. I expect to see a promotion to High A soon but he is still a ways away from the majors. He is worth a look in dynasties and keepers depending on how deep rosters are but he still has a lot of development left in him. He should be the top prospect in the Reds system next year since Hamilton will most likely be up at some point this year.

If you have any requests for players for me to do next week just let me know! Guys I have previously covered are Xander Bogaerts, Oscar Taveras, Noah Syndergard, Archie Bradley, Miguel Sano, Billy Hamilton, Trevor Bauer, Jameson Taillon and AJ Cole.

1362076531.0,32,self.fantasybaseball,19eraq,Announcement: Updated Posting Rules and Guidelines,KTrout17,36,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/19eraq/announcement_updated_posting_rules_and_guidelines/,"Welcome back everyone!

Clearly the new season is almost upon us, because /r/fantasybaseball  is nice and active once again. I thought this would be a good time to elaborate a bit on some rules and guidelines for posting and contributing, and open up a general conversation if anyone has any suggestions or thoughts.

   
**Posting Rules** - These rules are in place to benefit both you and the community as a whole, so please familiarize yourself with the rules in place. Submissions violating these rules may be removed, and could result in a warning or even ban if warranted.


**1 - No memes.**         
Memes can be hilarious from time to time, and obviously we're just here to have fun(for the most part.) But memes often get quickly voted to the top because they are quick, low-effort content, and results in relevant submissions by other users to be overlooked. There are perfectly acceptable reasons to post an image link, such as sharing league controversy, trade offers, trophies, rosters, etc., and those are generally fine. I will say, posting a link to your roster and asking how your draft went or what changes you should make is not the most useful way to get feedback(discussed further down). But if we find that these posts lead to negative/off-topic discussion they may be removed and potentially elimated. Please see the examples below:        


**2 - Trolling, harassment, or maliciously bad information will not be tolerated**              

We're all here to learn, get advice, and share our enjoyment of the game. We're going to disagree, and obviously there will be arguments, but it's all in good fun. There is no need for any kind of personal attack, and there's absolutely no place for deliberately giving another member of the community bad advice. Bad advice happens, I told several of you last year I thought Tommy Hanson was a reasonably good pitcher, but for whatever reason I actually believed it at the time.

If you see bad advice, correct them and discuss it. If you see a user consistently giving misinformation, please report them so we can message them and take the appropriate steps.

Personal attacks will be removed, and if necessary you'll be banned, there's no place for anything like that here.

**3 - No inane/off-topic posts.**            
We don't generally care how awesome you think your 4-team mixed roster is, or how hilarious your team name is. Let's do our best to keep submissions high-quality whenever possible.              

**4 - Do not post links to your personal blogs**               
I know this subreddit has a lot of users who create their own content. Some of it is fantastic. Some of it is really not(*no offense*). If your only contribution to this forum is posting your own blog links, they'll be removed and you'll be banned. If you're active, and comment in other submissions regularly, and you post your blog every week, they'll be removed. There are too many to allow them all. If you have a personal blog that is regularly updated with original, useful content, 'message the mods' and I'll consider adding you to the sidebar.

**5- Do not post premium content**

This goes two ways. Posting a link to an article that requires a paid membership doesn't help most of us, so please do not link to something that only subscribed members can view. More importantly, *do not give away someone elses premium content for free*. Copy-pasting or offering a backdoor link to content that is otherwise blocked, such as ESPN Insider articles or Rotowire Blogs, is copyright infringement. As useful as it might be to share something you have access to, this isn't the place for that. Any such content will be removed.


**If you do not see your post in the /New queue, please send me a message, it's very likely it got caught in the spamfilter, and I'd be happy to approve it for you.
____________________________________________________________             

        
**Posting Guidelines** - These are not rules. These are some basic suggestions to help you get the best advice possible, and help keep this place organized and civil. I highly encourage you all to follow these guidelines as best you can.


**1 - *Please* post your league's format and details.** 

Without knowing how many teams are in your league, the roster sizes, the scoring categories, Roto/H2H/Points, auction/snake/keeper/dynasty, AL/NL/Mixed, and anything else that affects how we'd be valuing players for you, there is *absolutely no way* for us to tell you which side wins a trade, how well your draft went, which keepers you should pick, or anything else. You'll just end up having to explain all of these things in the comments anyway, so please help us help you and just include these details in your post. Rather than submit a link to an imgur of your roster, submit a Text post and include a link or list the players in the text.

**2 - Please use the following tags** to help clarify what you're asking.       

* Who Should I Keep? - Use tag [KEEP] before title of post. Explain any penalties or costs involved(how many can you keep, what do they cost, do you have to keep a certain number of players?)     

&gt;ex: [KEEP] Need to pick five, 12-team roto/auction.          

* Review this trade - use tag [Trade] before title of post. Also clearly state give/get in title.        

&gt;ex: [Trade] Give Mike Carp / Get Mike Trout             

* Who do I start? - use tag [WDIS] before title of post. Post names of players being considered in title.         

&gt;ex: [WDIS] Ben Revere / Lorenzo Cain              

* Add/Drop - use tag [FA] before title of post. Say who you are thinking of picking up and dropping in the title.           

&gt;ex: [FA] Should I drop Alex Rodriguez for Alex Gonzalez?            


* Open Leagues - use tag [OL] before title of post. Say how many spots are available in your league, type of league, and which site it's on. **Please remove these posts once your league is full**

&gt;ex: [OL] 2 Spots in 12 Team Dynasty Roto, ESPN 

 * Will help in return - This is something I've seen on other forums that I've always liked. When you submit a question, tag it with [WHIR], and when someone answers your question they'll include a link to their own question in another post for you to answer in return. This encourages us to help one another, and rewards us for providing good info when we have our own questions as well.

&gt;ex: [Trade] Give Verlander / Get Garza and Butler [WHIR]

**3 - Be thoughtful when replying.** Explain yourself, and help us understand why you think what you think. If someone's new to Fantasy Baseball, a one word answer doesn't help them. Let us understand your logic, so we can learn, or so we can point out how wrong you are.

**4 - Use the search box.** Many questions have already been discussed many times, at great length(what sites to use, which formats are better, how vetoes are bullshit, etc.). It's always good to revisit these once in awhile for fresh discussion, but many times there are already some good answers out there for you.

**5 - Help make this place better.** This subreddit has come a long ways in recent years, from 50 users to nearly 4,000. By submitting good questions, good info, and providing good informed discussion, this forum can be incredibly useful to all of us. 

* Please report violations, so I can see them and deal with them. 

* Don't downvote opinions you disagree with. *Upvote them*, and correct them with good information, so everyone can see and get involved. We should only be downvoting irrelevant, inappropriate, or off-topic submissions or comments.

* If someone already answered what you were going to answer, simply upvote them and move on, and comment on their comment if you feel like elaborating on their opinion.

* If you have suggestions for things to add to the sidebar, a handy tool others might find useful, or something that might be nice to see like a weekly thread or competition, use the 'message the mods' link in the sidebar and I'd be glad to discuss, my only goal is to make this place a clean, organized, powerful tool to help every one of us dominate the season.



Any feedback or thoughts, please feel free to weigh in.

About 8 days ago I posted asking if an official reddit fantasy baseball league existed:

http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/x3s9a/is_there_an_official_reddit_fantasy_baseball/

Well apparently /r/redditdynasty is taking things to another level with a super deep 30 team keeper, but a ticket to that party is a tough commodity. So the concept of a tiered system with a potentially unlimited number of teams was discussed and it seems like the demand is there. 

As I mentioned before, /r/narffl, the official reddit fantasy football league, is going super strong with hundreds of teams registered for this upcoming season. The league has grown exponentially over the past couple years since it was created and I hope that we can achieve equal success.

So it has begun! But we need to discuss/vote/etc on a couple things before moving forward. A lot depends on how many people sign up for the first year and whatnot but we might as well all be on the same page and let the discussion floweth. To make a long story short, the basic gist is there will be different divisions and the top 1,2 or 3 teams and bottom 1,2, or 3 teams move up and down divisions each season so the most talented managers move up the totem pole 

We can't have keepers with this format (in theory we should be able to have enough teams to have multiple divisions and relegation so people will be switching leagues every year)

We can't decide on the number of teams (even though it will most likely be 12, possibly 10) or the breakdown of divisions until we know how many people are in. However we can start discussing other things

1. H2H, Roto, Sal Cap? I vote Roto...it is the purest way to do fantasy baseball and easier to compare teams in different leagues if the needs arises (most likely by year 2 or 3 this will be very large and we will have to have more concrete ways to determine relegation rules) Also it eliminates a bit of unluckiness...At the same time H2H will make things a bit more personal and lead to more crap talking which is always fun.

2. 5x5, 6x6, 7x7...Thoughts? I personally think we should go deep down the rabbit hole and do 7x7
Hitters - Runs, RBIs, Home Runs, SBs/NetSbs, K's, Average, OBP/OPS
Pitchers - Wins, Losses, Ks, Saves, ERA, WHIP, QS
Or the different tiers/divisions can use different settings. The higher the division the more stat categories.

3. Snake or Auction draft - I am 100% in love with auctions. You are given more freedom in regards to crafting your team. I'm also just one man.

4. Host? The Narffl is hosted through FLeaflicker. Apparantly they worked out some deal with them. I can contact the commishes and see exactly why they chose fleaflicker if we are interested. Personally I vote Yahoo...It is the most used and we can see each others yahoo fantasy sports profiles.

So voice your opinions below, bring up additional topcs we need to discuss, and get pumped!! I figure the next step is setting up an actual vote on the questions that need to be solved but lets talk it out first. Upvotes to all!!

And good luck making your playoff push


**EDIT 1**: Ah I love it. So roto it is. Year one we can just have as many 12 team roto leagues as we can fill up and than split everyone up into divisions come year 2. (probably stick to snake 5x5 year 1)It seems like people are down with the basic concept KTrout mentioned:

""A - Snake draft, h2h 5x5, non-keeper, top four teams are promoted end of year to AA
AA - Auction h2h 6x6 non-keeper, bottom four are demoted, top four are promoted
AAA - Auction h2h 6x6 keeper league, bottom four are demoted""

Only thing I suggest is not having keepers in the top tier so that everyone has an equal chance from day one. 

That blueprint can be stretched and altered when/if more people get involved as well. Also, many of these decisions don't exactly need to be made right now so we can make the decisions more concrete this point next year. When the season is underway next year, the members/the commishs can vote on the # of teams to be relegated each year, the categories and draft types for the upper divisions, and how to approach an expanding league.

***I'll let the conversation flow for another day or two and then make one more post compiling everything we came up with, opening up the podium for people who want to be commissioners, etc.***",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1343946471.0,,,True,t3_xk68k,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/xk68k/creating_the_official_limitless_league_for/,

1373149177.0,31,self.fantasybaseball,1hrriy,Odds of winning MLB.com's Beat the Streak contest,peanut_butter_smooth,32,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1hrriy/odds_of_winning_mlbcoms_beat_the_streak_contest/,"I don't know if this belongs in r/fantasybaseball, but I thought it was interesting and I don't know where else I would post it.

I was bored today, so I decided to figure out the chances of winning Beat the Streak. For anyone who doesn't know, the idea of the contest is to pick 1 or 2 players each day who you think will get a hit that day. If you can make 57 correct picks in a row, you win $5.6 million.



So here's my math:

We'll assume that the average batter picked is going to be a .350 hitter in his match-up (this average is probably generous to start with). This means that he will have a 35% chance of getting a hit in each at bat. We'll also assume that a player will get an average of 4 at bats per game.



First, we will find the odds that a player goes hitless in a given game. The .350 average from above means that there is a 65% chance the player will not get a hit. Multiplying that (0.650) by itself 4 times gives us the odds that a player will go hitless for the day:

**0.650 x 0.650 x 0.650 x 0.650 = 0.1785 (17.85%)**



Subtracting this from 100% will give the odds that a player gets at least 1 hit and keeps the streak alive:

**1.000 - 0.1785 = 0.8215 (82.15%)**



So there is an 82.15% chance that a player will get a hit in his game. Multiplying this by itself 57 times gives the chance that a player will get a hit in 57 straight games and ""Beat the Streak"":

**0.8215^57 = 0.00001357 (0.001357%)**



So if your picks hit .350 and get 4 at bats per game, there is only a 0.001357% chance of getting a streak up to 57 games and pocketing the $5.7 million.



**TL;DR** There's a 0.001357% chance of Beating the Streak.

I'm not trying to criticize the contest or dissuade anyone from playing, I think it's a lot of fun. I just thought it would be interesting to find the odds of winning. Also, I haven't taken any real math classes for a long time so let me know if my calculations or assumptions are flawed.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1373151384.0,,,True,t3_1hrriy,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1hrriy/odds_of_winning_mlbcoms_beat_the_streak_contest/,

Not sure how many of you are familiar with Beat The Streak but today only they are doing Beat The Streak in a Day. If you can pick 57 batters that get a hit today you win $5.6 million. I just wanted to make sure people didn't miss this chance. If you don't want to pick each individually you can auto pick.

The night before the draft, I analyzed the categories and realized that they heavily favor relief pitching with categories like K/9 and K/BB. So I decided to draft the minimum starting pitchers and go early in the draft for top relief to strengthen my pitching stats. Now that the members in my league understand my strategy, they are proposing upping the minimum innings pitched from the default 10 to 35 to force me to pick up starting pitching. What are your thoughts on this move? 

Edit: Thank you all for the input! At least now my LM sees how this is viewed by people outside of the league. For the sake of making everybody happy and avoiding the hassle of a redraft, I have agreed to the changes on the condition that the LM pay for all of my drinks the next time we go out.

Hey there everyone,

Now that the season's well underway and full panic has set in for most of you, I thought it would be a good time to start dragging in some ""expert advice"" here to help calm everyone down. Unfortunately, they all have contract stipulations saying they can't do anything like that.

BUT, I did manage to get one of the writers from [Razzball.com](http://razzball.com/), Jaywrong, to step up and try his hand at doing some Q &amp; A with everyone here, so that's a start.

Jaywrong writes several regular articles for Razzball.com, including [Deep Impact](http://razzball.com/deep-impact-abba-zaba-you-my-only-friend/), which focuses on digging through the scraps in deep leagues for usable refuse, and [Bull or Bear](http://razzball.com/bear-or-bull-dont-be-such-a-dickey/), which looks at good players that scare the shit out of us for one reason or another.

He'll be posting a Q&amp;A thread here Tuesday morning, and joining us at 1pm EST to answer any questions you all might have throughout the afternoon. They'll also be giving this a shoutout on their [weekly podcast](http://razzball.com/category/razzball-podcast/), which should be available around the same time.

Some general rules:

Rule #1: There are no rules

Rule #2: Please refrain from in-depth questions specific to your league. It's difficult to analyze your personal team and league accurately in this format, and doesn't benefit the others reading. Thoughts on players, comparisons, projections, strategies, formats, trends, analysis, etc., are much preferred

Rule #3: Don't be a dick. If this goes well, we should see more of these as the season goes along, from either the gentlemen over at Razz, or other, similarly gentlemenish men of several other sites out there.

Rule #4: No mustache jokes. He doesn't have a mustache, that's a different guy at Razzball.

Rule #5: *TBD*

Hopefully you all enjoy this and get some value out of it, either way play nice and stop dropping your studs already. Stanton just got his first Run and RBI's today, proof: patience pays off.

Anyway. **Fantasy Baseball Q&amp;A with Razzball's ""Handsome Fantasy Baseball Expert"" Jaywrong, Tuesday, April 23rd, 1PM, EST.**",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1366606435.0,,,True,t3_1cua70,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1cua70/mod_post_razzballs_jaywrong_will_be_stopping_by/,moderator

1367897463.0,27,self.fantasybaseball,1du9wf,Some stats regarding Mark Reynolds that can maybe answer some questions.,,29,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1du9wf/some_stats_regarding_mark_reynolds_that_can_maybe/,"Reynolds has been a guy I've been interested in all year because of his strangely high batting average, so I took a look at his stats today to find out what's going on. 

Note: I wrote this kind of like a fantasy baseball article, so don't mind the layout and style too much.

Through today, Mark Reynolds has been a career .237 hitter, but this year, he's hitting .296. Is it an anomaly though? Well, yes, but it is sustainable? Possibly. He won't hit .296 all season, but I think he can be more than just a one trick pony this year.

His BABIP so far is .308, barely above his career average of .306, and just over his projected number of around .290. If that's normal, what gives?  

Well, if we look at his strikeout percentage, we can see that he's striking out at a 23.9% clip, which is under his career average of 32.3%. It's also worth noting that his SO% last year was also under his career average at 29.6%. For a guy that (I believe) once set the record for strikeouts in a single season, this a great step forward. But why isn't he striking out as much?

You might say he has refined his mindset at the plate a bit; I can't verify that, but I'm willing to bet he's made some good strides in his approach. His O-Swing% isn't down though; in fact, it's up just a little bit at 27.2%. That's no reason to worry though as it's up a measly 1% from his career average and only 2% up from last year. Last year, it was a little more than 2% down from the previous year, and it's been up and down like that for his entire career, so it's is definitely not something worth over analyzing. 

The interesting stat is his O-Contact%. It's 60.3%. His career average is 45.9%, but it has been trending upward since 2008. Notable jumps came last year (52.1% from 47.3%) and this year (60.3% from 52.1%). Basically, what this means is he's still swinging like he has his whole career, but he actually gotten *better at hitting bad balls*. 

Is a 60.3% O-Contact% sustainable? Probably not. Is a .308 BABIP sustainable? Ehh, maybe. But as long as he doesn't completely fall off and start flailing at everything, Reynolds could provide you great power with an average that won't kill you. That seems to be a possible scenario, but as I pointed out, he's been trending upward over some years. He's off to a hot start, but I'm willing to bet this isn't *just* a hot start. 

He's definitely worth holding onto or picking up (if he's available, which he shouldn't be at this point...). At the very least, he'll give you good pop and solid RBI numbers to go with it.

I hope you guys that didn't just pass over this enjoyed reading it. Mark Reynolds isn't the most exciting guy to talk about, but he's been an interesting case thus far, so I thought he might be a good guy to bring up/discuss.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1367897706.0,,,True,t3_1du9wf,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1du9wf/some_stats_regarding_mark_reynolds_that_can_maybe/,

Hope everyone is making that final playoff push. So about a month ago I started conversations on setting up a multi division fantasy baseball league similar to /r/narffl. The response was overwhelmingly positive and this will 100% become a reality starting next season. I know that is many months away but I would like to start planning as soon as possible (and while everyone is still in fantasy baseball mode)

* See the first post on this subject [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/x3s9a/is_there_an_official_reddit_fantasy_baseball/) and the most recent post [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/xk68k/creating_the_official_limitless_league_for/)

* There is still much to discuss. In terms of growth, we have thrown around ideas, but realistically nothing can be determined until we have an idea of how many managers take part year one and how many new managers join in the second year.

Just for the sake of getting it on paper and getting people excited, I like the idea of

* A - 5x5, snake, top 2-4 promoted
* AA - 6x6, snake, bottom 2-4 demoted, top 2-4 promoted
* AAA - 6x6, auction, bottom 2-4 demoted, top 2-3 promoted
* Majors - 7x7, auction, bottom 2-3 demoted - league champions are exempt from relegation next season

And as it grows there will be subdivisions in a pyramid breakdown, with the most people/subdivisions in A than AA, etc. Depending on how many leagues we fill year one, the standings will determine where everyone is placed next year

So the topic we need to discuss first is 

* Yahoo, ESPN, or Fleaflicker? Most of the comments have been either about ESPN or Yahoo but it seems crazy not to consider Fleaflicker since they have made it clear that they would cater to our needs (considering the potential scale of this league I think that is invaluable). Personally I say we wait a month or so and make sure that the NARFFL runs smoothly and than just hop on board. If issues arise than we can open up discussions again on Yahoo or ESPN. 

* Outside of that, nothing really needs to be set in stone right now since year one everyone will be randomly put in 12 team 5x5 roto leagues (obviously need to discuss roster spots and whatnot but that can be done when next season starts to roll around)

**So please, let me know if we should be considering different settings for year one (randomly appointed 12 man 5x5 roto leagues) what site should host it, and if you have interest in becoming more involved in the process/want to be a commissioner . At the moment I believe only /u/lhjmq has sent me a pm regarding this matter but I'm sure there are many more out there. I'm sorry if I forgot about anyone else who contacted me**

***GET PUMPED...and for all those starting J Zimm tonight, I am keeping my fingers crossed with you***

Edit 1: I didn't make the situation as clear as I should have. While I would personally prefer to play on yahoo, looking into the future it would be a lot easier to stay organized as fleaflicker has accomodated /r/narffl. Honestly, given the fact that a couple years down the line there is no reason why there wont be 100+ teams, the fact that fleaflicker will set up the interface specifically for out wants and needs makes them an obvious choice in my opinion.

Edit 2: Upvote for visibility please (no karma for me) 

EDIT 3: 

""That is great news and very exciting you want to move your reddit baseball stuff over here. We would love to have you guys!

We can definitely accommodate you the same way we accommodated the NarFFL guys.""

JUST HEARD BACK FROM FLEAFLICKER. THEY OFFER FULL SEASON ROTO, REGULAR H2H CATEGORIES, AND SINGLE WIN H2H. I STILL THINK THAT FULL SEASON ROTO IS THE WAY TO GO...BUT THEY ARE VERY HAPPY TO ACCOMMODATE US. A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE HAVE DISPLAYED INTERST IN COMMISHING/BECOMING MORE INVOLVED.

So I decided to put my Rules Of Thumb in once place and see if any others have additions.  What do you think?


* Don't drop anyone you used a decent draft pick on until mid-June.  It's a long season, and you have a bench for a reason.

* Start your stars regardless of their matchup.  They're stars for a reason.
 
* For any trade you will have to give something to get something; don't ever expect to throw out crap and get anything but crap back.

* If at any point you can say  Player X^i &gt; Player Y^i for all players i in a trade and you are receiving the X-package  then you do this trade.  This is clearly only valid for *n*-for-*n* trades.

* When evaluating a trade, the only thing that matters is the following question: *Does this make my team better?*  If yes, pull the trigger.

* Beware hot players who have never shown consistent success in the pros.

* Prospect upside is fairly meaningless unless you are in a keeper league.  Pro baseball is tough to adjust to - a player's 2^nd or 3^rd year in the pros is often better than their first - if you're in a keeper league, give these guys time to adjust.

* Beware the hot spring training player.

* Veterans who do it every year are better picks than any player who has never done it.

* Don't fall in love with and overvalue your players.  You will lose out on good trades by valuing your players too highly.


**EDIT:** A lot of great comments - thanks.  Some people (solo, mojo) made me realize I need to do some editing and arguing, but it's Friday and I'm already drinking.  I'll update and argue tomorrow.  May the Baseball Gods shine down upon your team.

With that said, I'd like to bring some discussion to the idea of Value-Based Drafting in fantasy baseball.

A quick disclaimer: This post is long, and will involve math. The spreadsheet included is free to use for anybody, but is tailored for OBP based leagues.

If you would like to skip the text and jump right into the spreadsheet, or pull it up as you read, the link is below.

https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3UnZmeMA4wPMVJyMnhoUkNCMFE/edit

On to the wall of text!

The Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For those unfamiliar, VBD is a commonly used strategy in fantasy football. It takes into account the baseline production expected out of each position, thus correcting for different scoring expectations; i.e. QBs typically score much higher than other positions, TEs lower etc. Value based drafting, depending on the method, will tell you how many more points a player is expected to score than the next guy at his position, or a typical player at his position. Basically, VBD is a way of quantitatively adjusting for positional scarcity.

Now, to my experience, positional scarcity in fantasy baseball is often addressed in a more qualitative way. For example, Matthew Berry's latest fantasy baseball podcast on ESPN discusses how much of a bump Buster Posey gets for being a C vs. his value as purely a first baseman. They essentially settled on 1-2 rounds ""feeling"" right. It's easy to see why this is. In standard H2H or roto leagues, there are 5 categories for hitters, and 5 for pitchers. In comparison, in fantasy football it's much easier to compare between positions because all production goes into the same category: points. In baseball, the same analysis will get you +/- in 5 different categories; comparing apples to oranges.

The Methodology
-------------------------------------------------------------------

With all that in mind, we finally get to the point. Our goal is to go from comparing apples to oranges, to comparing apples to apples. In order to do so, I took a somewhat WAR-like approach. I took ESPN's projections and put them into a spreadsheet, sorted with an overall ranking, as well as positional rankings. Using this, I calculated the average of the 2*X number of players at each position, where X is the minimum number of starters at that position in my league. This creates a baseline ""replacement level"" player to compare to. Next, each player has a score calculated for each category: R, HR, RBI, SB, OBP. This score is calculated using the difference between each player's projected contribution and the replacement level contribution. This number is then normalized by dividing over the league leader's contribution in said category. This lets us address differentials across categories. Instead of wondering whether you should draft player A because he provides 7 more HRs than a replacement player or player B for providing 5 more SBs, you can see what percentage of the league leader in that category each contribution is.

Each player then has a total ""player value"" calculated as the sum of his contribution above the replacement level at his position in each category. This leads to players having very different scores depending on where you play them. For example, Carlos Santana drops more than 6(!) rounds as 1B vs. a C. This is because the ""replacement Catcher"" averages 60.2 runs, 18.75 HR, 71.9 RBI, 2.65 SB and a 0.344 OBP vs. a ""replacement 1B"" averages of 80.87/27.43/92.03/4.3/0.360.

Where I need help
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's where you come in Reddit. I'm not a stats major, I have a solid background in math, but if I'm being honest, most of my methodology basically can be summed up as ""tinker with it till it looks right"". I'm looking for any pointers on where I can improve my calculations. Specifically, I'm considering taking just the average of the X number of players around the minimum players started. I feel that top  catchers have been unnecessarily boosted by being compared to guys that will not see a draft board in anything less than a 15 team league. You'll also note that in the methodology segment, I did not mention how I calculated pitcher values. This is because despite using a similar system, I have no idea how to value each category in order to get an accurate comparison across pitchers and hitters. The link to my spreadsheet is given at the top of this post, as well as again below.

No matter who you are, what you throw, what team you're on, or any other ability you have or lack, if you can throw 96+ on a consistent basis, I want you on my team or at least on my radar.  This brings us to one Nate Eovaldi, a 23 year old pitcher on the Miami Marlins, with the highest fastball velocity out of any starting pitcher with at least 40 ip.  I'll analyze him a bit more, but I want to focus your attention on the very last chart behind this link:

http://www.brooksbaseball.net/pfxVB/pfx.php?s_type=3&amp;sp_type=1&amp;batterX=0&amp;year=2013&amp;month=7&amp;day=30&amp;pitchSel=543135.xml&amp;game=gid_2013_07_30_nynmlb_miamlb_1/&amp;prevGame=gid_2013_07_30_nynmlb_miamlb_1/

You see that uppermost row of dots?  Those are scud missiles, I mean fastballs, most aimed straight at the strikezone.  Notice that one green dot halfway across right above the ""100"" line.  That's a 100 mph fastball.  It was thrown for a ball, but such is life.  

According to Pitch f/x, he's in the zone 55% of the time.  His fastball is worth 7.9 runs above average, which when compared on a 100-pitch basis, puts his fastball in the vicinity of Kershaw's and Scherzer's (but this measures only 46ip from Eovaldi).  He throws it 62% of the time.  He also throws a slider 18%, which is a bit less inspiring, but is only a bit below league average. 

Now some downers: low babip, 11.5% bb% rate, xFIP says he's due some regression.  ZIPs and Siera dislike him as well.

Ok, back to the positives.  44% GB%. 17% LD% rate, which would partially explain the low BABIP.

He's having trouble getting guys to swing at his pitches outside the strikezone, but the stuff and skills to succeed are there.  He's managed to make the best of what he's got, putting up a 3.47 ERA in his 46ip this season, and pitching into the 6th inning or later in every single one of his starts but one (that's 7 QS out of 8 starts total).  In a deep league, i'd definitely prefer this guy over some of the more hyped pitchers out there, especially in keeper/dynasty formats.

1371912692.0,24,self.fantasybaseball,1guvey,[Keeper League] The case for O. Arcia,SonnySideUp,30,6,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1guvey/keeper_league_the_case_for_o_arcia/,"I am just floored by the lack of coverage for a 22 year old kid doing what he's doing against major league pitching with a minor league track record like his.  I'm here to change this.

O. Arcia: 267/333/466 in 144 PA; 198 ISO, 7.6% BB%, 26.4% K%, 348 wOBA  

I ran a simple search on Fangraphs for every 22 year old with a qualifying season since 1990.  

Players with an ISO at or around .200 in their age 22 season:  

J. Heyward (210)  
B.J. Upton (209)  
Andruw Jones (208)  
A. Dunn (206)  
F. Freeman (196)  
G. Sizemore (195)  
W. Cordero (195)  
R. Zimmerman (191)  
I. Rodriguez (190)  

Players with a wOBA around 350 in their age 22 season:  

R. Furcal (355)  
Derek Jeter (354)  
P. Fielder (354)  
J. Heyward (351)  
J. Upton (349)  
J. Olerud (349)  
N. Markakis (345)  
G. Jefferies (345)  

Players with a bb% at or near 7.6% in their age 22 season:

N. Markakis (7.9)  
I. Rodriguez (7.7)  
S. Burroughs (7.6)  
R. Alomar (7.4)  
G. Sizemore (7.4)  
D. Jeter (7.3)  
C. Baerga (7.3)  
O. Infante (7.2)  
H. Blalock (7.2)  

Other than Burroughs, Baerga, and Blalock all of the above comps are fantastic, but of course it's not all unicorns and rainbows.  He has a 26.4% K% rate.  The relevant age 22 comps:

T. Fryman (24.3)  
A. Dunn (25.1)  
J. Upton (26.6)  
B.J. Upton (28.1)  
B. Gil (32.4)  

Other than Gil and Fryman, all of the above featured a bb% rate of at least 11%.  The good news is K% rate improves with age, so there is hope yet for Mr. Arcia.  But given what he's shown us thus far, I can't help but be excited by some of the above comps.  The closest since 1990 seem to be G. Sizemore and J. Heyward.  He obviously has less speed than these guys, and probably less projectability than Heyward, but the results are similar.  So here are the guys with the best comps (including two bonus notables from history).  All have OK but not great walk rates, poor strikeout rates, and very good power.  All 4 have (or will, in the case of Heyward) turned out great.

Reggie Jackson, age 22, 614 PA in MLB, 8.1% BB%, 27.9% K%, 250/316/452  
J. Heyward, age 22, 651 PA in MLB, 8.9% BB%, 23.3% K%, 269/335/479  
Juan Gonzalez, age 22, 632 PA in MLB, 5.5% BB%, 22.6% K%, 260/304/529  
G. Sizemore, age 22, 706 PA in MLB, 7.4% BB%, 18.7% K%, 289/348/484

If he ends up anywhere near these guys in production, he's a definite keeper.  And how much hype is he getting? Absolutely NONE.

Player B's 3 year average stats:
106 R, 33 HR, 26 SB, 109 RBI, .318 BA

In each category, the players put up almost identical seasons outside of SB.  In raw numbers, player B is the better player, because you gain ~2 R, ~3 HR --but primarily + 21 SB.

But this is why position matters.  Let's say Player A plays 2B and Player B plays OF.  How do they compare to other mid-level players at their position?

The fourth best 2B last year had this stat line:

86 R, 18 HR, 77 RBI, 15 SB and .281 BA

*A difference of -18 R, -12 HR, -32 RBI +10 SB and -.030 BA*

93 R, 27 HR, 82 RBI, 21 SB and a .269 BA

*A difference of -13 R, -6 HR, -27 RBI, -5 SB, -.049 BA*

If you draft Player A, you can expect get along the lines of +5 R, + 6 HR, + 5 RBI, -15 SB and -.019 BA overall.

Now, maybe the 15 SB and .19 BA is worth more to you than the 5 R, 6 HR and 5 RBI.

----------------------------------

The original idea was brought up 2 months ago [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/xk68k/creating_the_official_limitless_league_for/) and then discussed again a month ago [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/zh6rn/moving_forward_on_the_creation_of_the_official/) 

Well, the brain trust (those who expressed interest in setting this up/commishing) and I have been planning and discussing and planning...and this is where we stand:

**Year 1 - upcoming 2013 season**

Unlimited 12 man standard 5x5 Roto leagues - While H2H is generally favored, the major problem with a league this size is defunct managers, and they will have a muchhhh smaller negative impact on Roto than H2H. Unfortunately this is the biggest issue with NarFFL and using Roto will minimize that problem. Fleaflicker will set up as many leagues as  we need and it will be very easy to commish all of them.

1500 Innings Pitched limit, standard roster size

Runs, RBIs, Home Runs, Steals, Batting Average

ERA, WHIP, Wins, Ks, Saves

**Year 2 and beyond**

After year 1 managers will be appointed to one of the various divisions based on their performance (the exact breakdown will 100% depend on the number of managers in year 1, so once the drafts take place we will put together exactly how you will be placed year 2). 

* Majors - 7x7 - league champions are exempt from relegation next season
* AAA - 6x6	
* AA - 5x5
* A - 5x5 - Rotisserie

We will hammer down specific settings, but essentially as you move up divisions the roster size will expand and the scoring categories will get more complex. There will be multiple leagues in each division, and as you move up from A to the majors, the # of leagues will decrease. (I understand that this is a very loose description, but we will stay organized and as the league reaches mass proportions we will eventually settle on a specific # of leagues in each division.)

New members will be placed into leagues in A which will always be rotisserie (gotta earn your stripes and it is a more accurate tell of a better team than playoff performance alone)

Unless people are terribly against it, AA will be Roto as well.

AAA will add OBP and Quality Starts and will be H2H

Majors will change steals to net steals, change saves to net saves add OBP, Hitters Ks, Quality Starts, and Holds. Will also probably be an auction draft...big boy league for sure. 

As I said before, the exact shift in roster size, draft type, and settings will be decided upon in the future (not vital until year 2)

One of the things I dislike about NarFFL is the difficulty of moving up divisions (and there are only 2 divisions) so there will be a constant shift every year based on performance (nothing too crazy but instead of having the winners of leagues in the alt division compete in a playoff challenge and only a portion of them moving up to the premier league, a much larger % of teams will move up/down so that everyone will always have motivation to fight til the bitter end, depending on size of the league and how many new managers join year 2, it will probably be 2-3 teams per league promoted and demoted)

***Thoughts, comments, concerns? Please keep in mind that we can't make everyone 100% happy with every detail, and that decisions have to be made with the fact that there will be hundred(s) of teams***

So...pardon my language, but this should be a fucking blast.

Enough business though...We need to decide upon a league name (and eventually division names in the future) so that we can make a sub specifically for this league and everything can be much more organized. See below for some ideas. Brainstorm and chat it up (whatever league name we go with either has to be simple enough that we can make an easy to remember sub name or can be shortened to do so)

* The Naturals
* Bad News Narwhals 
* Sandlot Roto 
* Back to the Minors
* The Bacons of Baseball
* The Sultans of Statistics
* Major League Fantasy Baseball (MLFB)
* Reddit Fantasy Baseball
* The Fantasy League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  
* The Reddit Roto
* THE Fantasy Baseball League (THEfbl)
* Bacon Wrapped Fantasy Baseball League

Please pm me/comment if you have experience with coding subreddits as we would like ours to looks all pretty and whatnot with sexy flair. You will be treated like a king and showered with karma. Also, once a league name is chosen we can all let our creative juices flow and come up with a league emblem and sub header.

Look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts and additional awesome ideas. Once everything is ok'ed and we settle on a league name, I will make a new sub. In addition, I have reached out to the NarFFL founders and hopefully they can share their knowledge and let me pick their brains.

Just as an FYI, I am a fantasy sports addict and absolutely love the game. See [HERE](http://profiles.sports.yahoo.com/user/AWWLUB6KFTI2LTFHPQH5TNSTLM) for my credentials (I do have another yahoo account since they cap it at 8 leagues per season and also play on ESPN and keeper leagues on CBS).

Sonny Gray will be the next guy added to the Athletics rotation once a spot becomes available. He is currently in AAA with a 8-5 record, 2.81 ERA with 107 Ks and 34BB. Simply by looking at his statline you can tell Gray is having a fantastic season. His scouting reports show a above average fastball and curveball to go along with an average changeup. While none of his pitches look like they are that of a star Gray has been able to make do with what he has and is striking out batters and showing some really good command. Expect Gray to be up sometime after the all star break and with a powerful A's lineup he could be someone who contributes right away. Gray is worth a look in all leagues and should be owned in keepers/dynasties simply because of his potential to be a high K guy.

**Anthony Ranaudo**

23, Starting Pitcher for the Boston Red Sox(Currently in AA)

Ranaudo was once a top prospect in the Sox system but had some injury problems and a couple of down years but has re-asserted himself as a top option for the Red Sox rotation in the future. He is currently in Double A and has a 2.67 ERA over 16 starts(8-2 record) to go along with 94Ks and 34 BB. Like Gray he has an above average Fastball and Curveball plus an average changeup. However, as shown by his preformance this year he shows that he can be a quality pitcher despite not having any plus pitches. Expect him to get the call up to AAA in the near future and if he continues to pitch this well he could be in line for a September call up. He is worth a look in all leagues and should be owned in dynasties and deep keepers.

**Gary Sanchez**

20, Catcher New York Yankess (Currently in High A)

Sancehz and Miguel Sano were the two big names signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2009. While Sano is considered the better prospect, Sanchez has a lot of value and ability. On the season he is hitting .269 with 12 HRs and 57 RBIs. He projects to be an average hitter so do not expect him to hit for a great average but he has plus power potential and could really help in that department. The Yankess farm system is pretty weak right now but Sanchez is one of the few bright spots. He still probably has a year or two until he makes the majors but is worth a look in dynasty leagues or deep keepers because of his great power potential.

**George Springer**

23, Outfield Houston Astros(Currently in AAA)

Springer is considered the #3 prospect in the Astros system but he is having an amazing season. He started off the year in AA and has since made the Jump to AA on the season he holds a .307 average with 23 HRs, 65 RBIs and 28 stolen bases. The biggest knock on Springer is his strikeouts. In 313 ABs this season he has 109 Ks so a lot of his game is swing and miss but when he does make contact he makes it count. He projects to be an average hitter but has above average power as well as some speed. The Astros are in no rush to call their prospects up but if Springer keeps hitting as well as he is right now there is a good chance we could see him in Houston by the end of the season. He is worth a look in all leagues because of his power speed combo and without a doubt should be owned in deep keepers and dynasties.

Sano was recently promoted to AA after starting off the season hitting .330 with 16 HRs and 48 RBIs in High A. Through 8 games in AA he is hitting .150 with 2 HR and 8 RBIs. While the average has not come along yet he has walked 7 times and is showing his power is for real. Sano was signed out of the dominican republic by the twins and is arguably the best power hitter in the minors right now. Sano should be an a guy who hits for a decent average bur great power in the big leagues. He originally was a SS but due to some growth (Listed as 6'3 195) was moved to third and his defense is coming along there. Sano is drawing some comparisons to Miguel Cabrea but he currently does not have the plate discipline or contact ability to be a guy who can hit for top average and power. The Twins are historically slow with their prospects but we could see Sano up in September if he gets on a hot streak. The realistic thing however is Sano finishing off the year in AA and then making the team out of spring training(Similar to what Aaron Hicks did for the Twins this year) Sano should be owned in all deep keepers/Dynasties and if you have an extra bench spot there is a slight chance he could provide some help by the time September rolls around.

**Noah Syndergard**

Now that Wheeler has gotten the call up Syndergard is the top Pitching prospect in the Mets system. He started the season in High A with a 3-3 Record, 3.11 ERA and 64 Ks to go along with only 16 Walks. He was recently promoted to AA and in his first game allowed 2 runs walked 1 batter and stuck out 7 in 6 IP. Syndergard has a plus fastball as well as an above average change up and a serviceable curveball. His control coming into the season was a thing of question but the 4:1 K/BB ratio this season shows he may have figured out some of his control problems. Don't expect him to be able to contribute until later next season or the start of the 2015 season. However, the idea of Having Harvey Wheeler and Syndergard to front a rotation is something that is very attractive and the Mets pitching staff should be set for years to come. Syndergard should only be owned in Dynasties and Deep keeper leagues.

**Archie Bradley**

Coming into the season people knew Archie Bradley had ace stuff, it was his command that was the question. Well he has answered that question by putting up some amazing numbers this year and will easily be in the discussion for the top pitching prospect in all of baseball next year. He started the season off in High A but through 5 games boasted a 1.26 ERA with 43Ks and 10 BB so he was promoted to AA where he has continued to dominate. Through 9 games in AA he has a 5-3 record with a 2.29 ERA as well as 60Ks to go along with 27BB. The 26 BB in AA are a bit of a concern since his K/BB ratio is just above 2:1 but a lot of that is due to a couple of starts where his command just wasn't with him. Coming into the season his fastball and change up were considered above average but with how he has pitched this year they may very well be considered plus options next year. Bradley has the potential to be a September call up if the Diamondbacks are contending and could use some rotation help but Tyler Skaags is still the first man in line in their farm system. Bradley should be owned in all dynasties and deep keepers and is worth a look in redrafts since he has ace potential and could help out and the end of the season.

**Oscar Taveras**

Taveras is without a doubt the best hitting prospect in baseball right now. He was slowed down by a sprained ankle but since then has come back and appeared to pick up where he left off but appears to have re-injured his ankle. Through 43 games Taveras is hitting .294 with 5 HRs, 28 RBIs 9 BB and 22 strikeouts. Taveras is drawing comparisons to Vladimir Guerrero due to his ability to make contact with nearly any pitch thrown his way. This contributes to his low strikeout rate as well as a low walk rate. Taveras has the tools to be an elite hitter who can hit for both average and power and should be a force to be reckoned with for years to come. The only question is when the time will come.The Cardinals outfield appears to be pretty set right now with Beltran and Holiday going strong and Jon Jay manning center so the obvious path would be through an injury. Beltran is 36 and most people expect at some point he will be injured. The other option is replacing Jon Jay. Jay has pretty sub-par this season and if he does not turn it around by the All Star break we could potentially see the Cardinals replace Jay with Taveras. Taveras should be owned in all keepers and dynasties and if he doesn't miss much time this go around he is worth a look in redrafts simply because of his upside and the team he will play for.

I've been writing a Java program that scrapes ESPN's website for fantasy statistics for a given league ID/year, stores them in a database, then will have methods to retrieve the data as necessary.

The power of this is that I can retrieve this data and shape it into graphs, or analyze it how I want, not just on what ESPN gives me.

Examples of things I might do:

- Basic statistics: pitching points per week, hitting points per week, by position, by team, etc... all with some pretty visualizations!

- Bad Luck Brian: Determine which teams have bad luck against their opponents. Using simple points against isn't really a sufficient indicator since, if you're a good team, you'll naturally have fewer points against since you don't play yourself. However, we can take the average per week for each team, and detect by how much teams exceed that average against certain teams. The guy whose opponents typically exceed their average is the Bad Luck Brian of the league.

- Where do I need help? Again, the differential between one of your positions and the rest of the league is a good indicator of where you need some aid. Might able to later expand this into figuring out who has excess at a certain position to perhaps facilitate trade ideas.

Again, I'm doing this because I'm a bit bored and want to hone my development skills with some of the new technologies available on the web.

So why am I posting this here? Well, I want to guage interest. I'm doing it for my current ESPN H2H Points league, and would happily make this publically available once it's done... but the first pass will be pretty limited in scope as to what league type it can handle.

My questions to y'all are:

1. Does this sort of thing interest you?
2. Do you have a ESPN H2H Points league?
3. Any ideas of other analytics you might want to see with the data available on ESPN's site?

And for those development folks who are wondering what sort of technologies I'm using:

- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (for obvious reasons)
- [D3](http://d3js.org/) (for visualizations)
- [DropWizard](http://dropwizard.codahale.com/) (for easy packaging)
- [JPA/Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/)
- [Jersey](http://jersey.java.net/) (for services that return JSON)
- [Jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) (for processing the DOM)
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) (for the database)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/tschmal/MLBFantasyStats) (it's not very polished code or design, so don't murder me)
- Whatever else might be useful.
- Let me know if you'd like to contribute and we can chat. I'm pretty totalitarian with me code, though, but it'd be nice to bounce design ideas off of someone that knows JPA/Hibernate.

**TL;DR** - I want to make a website that can analyze your league and provide you some analytics about the league itself, and specific teams. I would like your feedback! See the three questions above!

Edit: Added some technology links for giggles.

Edit 2: Based on some of this feedback, it seems like there's a lot of interest in other formats, sports, and fantasy providers. This means I've got to re-organize the design a bit. Thus, a lot of the code on GitHub right now will probably be chucked (except the DOM parsing). I'll try to make it generic enough to support expansion in the future. Still, my primary focus will be *my* use case for now (H2H points ESPN).

1330835270.0,23,self.fantasybaseball,qgscf,Fantasy Baseball as a constrained optimization problem?,cw87,23,0,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/qgscf/fantasy_baseball_as_a_constrained_optimization/,"Crossposted from r/askreddit:

I’ve been toying with an interesting(to me) problem and thought I’d put it out there to see if anybody had any thoughts. I’m into fantasy sports and with the baseball season coming up, I was thinking about who to draft and who to avoid. I'm specifically referring to H2H formats and using ESPN for rules/roster sizes.

Specifically, I’m going off of ESPN’s standard roster: Total Roster Size: 25+1 (13 Batters, 9 Pitchers, 3 Bench, +1 DL)

Batters (13): C, 1B, 2B, 3B, SS, OF, OF, OF, OF, OF, 2B/SS, 1B/3B, UTIL
Pitchers (9): P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P, P
Bench (3): BE, BE, BE
Disabled List (1): DL

With this in mind, I began evaluating players and their given rankings. In this format, it seemed to me that what you’re really trying to do is to maximize your scores in each category and that dominating a single category is really not that useful; in other words, it’s better to win each category marginally than it is to win one category in a landslide. So I began by working with just the hitters for the sake of simplicity. Pitchers complicate things because they should be subdivided into starting and relief pitchers. Additionally, I only looked at the top 170 hitters and the top 130 pitchers because in a 10 team league the maximal amount of hitters that can be taken would be 10 * (13 + 3 Bench + 1 DL).

From there, I wrote a small program in Python to download 2012 projections and calculate the mean for each category, then sum up each player’s multi-stat contribution by summing up their total categorical differences from the categorical means. Projection is extremely difficult and outside the scope of this problem so I simply used ESPN’s 2012 projections. What I want to do is to identify the best multi-stat contributors rather than focusing on one stat wonders. I did this and came up with an already interesting list, but the thought occurred to me that some stats are highly correlated with others. For example, home runs are going to be highly correlated with runs batted in. I then ran the correlation on each pair of stats and found:

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and Home Runs: -0.378145898254

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and Runs: 0.407344916712

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and RBI: -0.391241974411

Correlation coefficient for Stolen Bases and AVG: -0.0357487109075

Correlation coefficient for Home Runs and Runs: 0.400202256444

Correlation coefficient for Home Runs and RBI: 0.855432710116

Correlation coefficient for Home Runs and AVG: 0.112844039465

Correlation coefficient for Runs and RBI: 0.456866404969

Correlation coefficient for Runs and AVG: 0.330686850925

Correlation coefficient for RBI and AVG: 0.382051876962

We see a few expected correlations: SB is negatively correlated with HR and RBI, categories the “power” hitters dominate who tend to be slower and unable to steal bases due to their body mass that gives them that power. Likewise, those two power categories are highly correlated with one another. Interestingly, HR and AVG don’t seem to be highly correlated. There is some logic to this: home run hitters will frequently swing a great deal and as a result will have higher strikeout rates and correspondingly lower batting averages. Obviously this isn’t always the case as some like Pujols have extremely high batting averages and HR counts.

What’s interesting about this is it made me realize that my method for identifying multi-stat contributors is going to be affected by certain correlations or lack thereof. So by picking up a power hitter, I’ll (usually) gain RBIs but what would be really great is to pick up other less correlated categories like SB where it’s actually negatively correlated.

What I’m wondering is how exactly can I formulate this as a constraint problem to maximize multi-stat contribution while rewarding players who contribute in categories that statistically are not expected. I’m thinking that the way to approach this is to look at rather than the total differences from the means, it would be better to consider some summation that takes into account the correlation. Specifically, something like (1-corr(x,y)) that would reward negatively correlated pairs of stat categories and discount highly correlated positive pairs. Additionally, to take it a step further, it would be useful to take into account positional scarcity. In other words, reward players with the best multi-stat contributions and also play at positions where value is scarce or where the position itself is scarce. One good example would be catchers: there’s a smaller amount of players who play catcher as opposed to outfielders. This should probably be done with the concept of replacement players(VORP) but I’ve yet to tackle this issue. I’d love to hear any ideas that anybody has regarding the whole thing.

TLDR: I'm looking to formulate fantasy baseball as a mathematical optimization problem that rewards the best multi-stat players and particularly those who contribute to unexpected stats, like power hitters who steal bases. Any ideas on how to factor in some of the pieces would be appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,True,,,True,t3_qgscf,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/qgscf/fantasy_baseball_as_a_constrained_optimization/,

Just a quick follow up on everything that's been discussed over the last few days. One of the Admins confirmed with me last night that he's able to automate some of these daily/weekly posts for us going forward, so I'd like to run my thoughts by you guys and hear any feedback you guys might have before going forward with things.


I'd like to keep the daily threads to a minimum, because I'm quite sure the frontpage would get overrun with multiple ""high volume"" threads going each day, and we still want room for individual posts. So my preference would be to have a daily trade thread posted at 8am EST each day, and a weekly post to discuss Start/Sit/Add/Drops, possibly posted Sunday morning to help the Weekly Lockers as well as let everyone else get in and discuss before. 

Again, **these are not mandatory threads, and it is perfectly acceptable for you to post your own submission.** But I do think there is value in promoting these as a convenient and clean option for everyone to use, and if successful, could potentially provide everyone with more feedback on their questions than some of the selfposts currently receive.

So, the text of the two proposed automated threads is below, and I'd welcome any feedback on the headlines, the topics, and the wording of the text itself, as I'm sure they could be improved upon:



**Daily Trade Talk for 06/26/13**

Your daily home to talk trade offers, and discuss players worth buying and selling.

When requesting trade advice, please include the following information:

* League Format: Roto/H2H/Pts, scoring categories, and number of teams

* League Type: Redraft/Keeper/Dynasty, Mixed League/AL-Only/NL-Only

* Keeper Considerations: Cost or penalty for keeping the players involved

* Relevant Roster Information for both parties: Who are you replacing, what are your needs, what are your trade partners needs, can they afford what you're asking?

* Team Standings and Concerns: Are you leading, trailing, falling apart, or gaining ground? Did your only speed guy just hit the DL? 

Remember, you're here for good advice, and no one here can give you that without understanding your format and your situation. The more you give us to work with, the better the advice you'll get in return.  So please avoid vague questions. If you want to know what Player X is worth, find the one or two teams in your league that need him the most, and share with us some players on their roster you are interested in.

Upvote comments for discussion, and correct misinformation. Downvotes should be reserved for off-topic comments.

As always, these discussions only work if everyone is getting good advice, so please try and help others while you're here. The more help you give, the more advice everyone here gets. Look for unanswered questions and weigh in, and take the time to help those who took the time to help you.



**Weekly Start'em, Sit'em, Add'em or Drop'em Discussion for Week 14**

Your weekend home to prepare for the week and season ahead.

When requesting advice, please include the following information:

* League Format: Roto/H2H/Pts, scoring categories, and number of teams

* League Type: Redraft/Keeper/Dynasty, Mixed League/AL-Only/NL-Only

* Matchup Concerns: Are you concerned about a pitching-heavy opponent, did your power just hit the DL, or are you simply re-evaluating your options?

* Team Standings: Are you leading, trailing, falling apart, or gaining ground?

You're here for good advice, and no one here can give you that without understanding your format and your situation. The more you give us to work with, the better the advice you'll get in return.

This is my first AMA here, but I'm very excited to answer any fantasy baseball questions you may have.  

I have been a Fantasy Baseball writer for half a decade, a player since the early 2000's (hells yea having Barry Bonds in a BB league!) and love everything fantasy.

My focus is on starting pitching - but I follow every part of the game.  I have been writing my [Pitcher Profiles](http://razzball.com/category/pitcher-profiles/) the past 2 years where I break down starters pitch-by-pitch in a game for a more introspective breakdown into their numbers for that start.  I've also developed my own statistic called [Gamescore+](http://razzball.com/a-new-razzball-exclusive-stat-gamescore/) to attempt and put a numerical value on my breakdowns.

AMA - but as my good friend JayWrong advises on his AMAs, general fantasy questions might help a tad more.  Not to say you can't throw in some hooblah here and there.

You can follow me [@jbgilpin](https://twitter.com/jbgilpin) on the twitter, or on [Razzball.com](http://razzball.com/) for new articles and ask me questions every weekday morning on our head writer Grey Albright's daily round-ups.

1368890252.0,19,self.fantasybaseball,1ekv22,"Reddit, let's talk about Jedd Gyorko",SonnySideUp,23,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1ekv22/reddit_lets_talk_about_jedd_gyorko/,"Off the bat, if you're in a 12 team redraft league, nothing to see here, move along.  He's a rookie with some potential, but he bats 6th or worse in a bad lineup and terrible home park.  He's replacement level, at best.  

If you're in a 14 or 16 team league, or any keeper/dynasty format, keep reading.

What you have here is a guy who in 2012 slashed 262/356/431 in AA and followed that up with a 328/380/588 in AAA (granted, in the PCL, but he was nevertheless among the league leaders).  He performed admirably in spring training, and won he 2b job.  

In 160 at bats, this 24 year old rookie, who barely cracked the top 50 on most prospect lists, has slashed 269/331/421.  ZIPS predicts a slight downgrade in all three stats for the rest of the season, but I think there is some reason to disagree:

(1) He's just getting used to the league.  Over the last 30 days, he has unceremoniously slashed 289/333/500.  Over the last 15, 333/388/600.  This doesn't look like a guy the league is figuring out.  Quite the opposite, actually.

(2) He is a line drive machine.  Over 160 at bats, he's hit line drives at a rate of 27.9%.   That's 6th highest in MLB.  The reason this is important is BABIP on line drives is much higher than on any other type of hit.  For reference, Joey Votto is at 28.7%, and Joe Mauer is at 30.6%.  I'm not saying Jedd Gyorko is Joey Votto incarnate with 2b/3b eligibility, but that's good stuff!

(3) He has a 324 BABIP, which refreshingly is supported by his batted ball profile.  See pt. 2 above.  High BABIPs are reserved for speedsters and guys who can hit line drives.  Gyorko can hit for a batting average.  I am not saying he'll bat 330 like the luminaries listed in pt. 2, but a 270-280 is not out of the realm of possibility.

(4) He has an excellent eye. To wit, so far this season, he's offered at 31.6% of pitches outside the strike zone.  This is by no stretch of the imagination 'elite', but it's impressive for a 24 year old rookie.  Other guys in his range: Brett Gardner, Jon Jay, Adrian Gonzalez, Allen Craig.  He has an 8.1% bb%, and this is in line with his walk rates throughout the minors (7.8% - 12.2%).  Since this is a skill that typically improves with age/experience -- or at least doesn't decline sharply -- we can classify this as a strength.  He can get on base.

(5) He can hit for power.  What I love about his batted ball profile, other than all the line drives, is that he has a reasonable 37.8% GB rate, and a very impressive 34.2% FB rate.  Those flyballs are what homeruns are made of.  I don't have access to his FB+HR distance charts (does anyone?), but 10.4% of his flyballs have become homeruns.  Just glancing at his texas leaguers spray chart, at least one of those was some 20 feet behind the outfield wall, so we know he CAN smash (in case the 260 ISO in AAA last season wasn't sufficient evidence).  Rough back of the napkin calculations: assuming 600 at bats, 33% of which are flyballs, that's 200 FBs.  10% of those are HRs . . . that's 20 dingers from your 2b, coupled with a 270/280 BA, and a 330/340 OBP.

(6) Position flexibility.  He's 3b/2b eligible this season.  8 more starts at 3b, and he retains the same eligibility in most leagues next season.  

This season?  He's OK.  Next season, is Gyorko a budding star?  I welcome your thoughts!",,False,self,t5_2quxe,False,,,True,t3_1ekv22,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1ekv22/reddit_lets_talk_about_jedd_gyorko/,

Finally, I have a deep-rooted man-crush on Jason Kipnis. Follow me on da Twitta [@TerseRazzball](https://twitter.com/TerseRazzball) and read me at [Razzball](http://razzball.com/author/terse/).

&gt;As you'd expect, the more general a question is, the better it is for the community as a whole. Thanks!

Tom Jacks, step forward, please.

&gt;Hey guys – this is my first time doing one of these, so let’s make it a great one!

IMO he is definitely worth buying low. 

* He has somehow managed a .355 OBP, which is right on line with his career average despite a heavily lowered BA. 
* He has 53 runs scored which is still on pace for over 100. 
* His BABIP which is at .303, is significantly lower than his career BABIP of .332. 
* Hes making contact on pitches inside the strike zone at a 75% rate, his career average is over 81%, even though he's swinging at the highest rate of strikes since 2008 (13.1%). He's also swinging a career average amount at pitches outside the strikezone. 

While his heavily increased walk-rate is largely responsible for his rather high .OBP, he's been more patient at the plate given his high walk rate, and his normal swing percentage on pitches outside the strikezone. I think with his BABIP bound to go up, and his contact rate on strikes bound to go up; if you combine those two increases with the fact he's swinging at a lot more strikes already, his production is going to increase favorably. 

I fully expect him to hit .290 with almost a .400 OBP rest of the way. I don't expect his walk rate to dip, and if he starts making more contact and his BABIP increases I don't see why .290 isn't reachable ROS. I don't know if he will reach 30 HR's but I can't see how he doesn't get close.

So rest of the way I think he hits around .290, 13 HR, 45 RBI, 40 BB, 50 R, 60 Ks. In a 10 team H2H points league Im going to try to buy low, what do others think of Upton ROS?

Why do I tell you now is the time?

After going through much of the season with problems in his back, his 'hard' knuckleball had been floating in at about 74-76MPH with his fastball topping out around 81MPH. 

Dickey came on record a couple of weeks ago as saying that it is the first time all season that he has felt totally healthy. R.A.'s 'hard' knuckler over the last coupe of games is now coming in between 77-81MPH and his fastball is topping out at 86MPH today. All told, he went 7 strong with 2ER and did it against Detroit no less all while holding Miggy 0-4 and striking him out twice. 

Couple this with the fact that he is mixing his 'slow' knuckler in intermittently with great effectiveness and that CY award doesn't seem like it was all that long ago all of a sudden.

I am the commissioner of a $200 entry fee league that has been going on for 6 years.  This is my first year in Fantasy Baseball, and I'm doing OK, currently holding 2nd place in the Nolan Ryan Division of /r/SultansOfStats.

For Football, I follow Matthew Berry, among others. His stance on vetoing trades is something I believe in whole-heartedly. His philosophy is as follows:

&gt;If there is obvious collusion between two owners, then the commissioner (or league via veto) should not allow it. But other than that? Let it go. People should be allowed to coach their team and trade whoever they want, even if you think it's a really stupid rip-off trade. Negotiating a steal of a deal is part of fantasy skill and as long as both parties want to do the deal, you're a punk if you block it. Especially the people who block a trade just because it doesn't involve them or because it's part of their ""strategy"" to block other teams from improving. That's the coward's way out and you're a scummy, spineless punk if you do that. Win on the virtual field, not in the bureaucracy.

I guess my questions is, shouldn't this philosophy be the same for baseball? Is it generally considered the same for baseball and are all these veto posts I've been seeing coming from the runt of the pack?

Unless obvious collusion, no reason to veto a trade, period. I don't wanna be that guy 
&gt; (""That guy"" vetoes a trade because it doesn't involve him or her. Hate the veto guy. Win on the virtual field, not in legal loopholes. Trade negotiation is part of fantasy skill. As long as both trade partners think they are improving their team, the trade should stand. Doesn't matter if you don't agree. Not your team, genius. You're not the judge. Unless there is collusion, no trade should ever be overturned.)*.

meaning if they plan on punting saves or stolen bases, they could put a 1, and if they want to concentrate and dominate on Home Runs, they could put a 8-10 or something like this.

21, OF Miami Marlins

While Yelich has had a bit of a down season(per his standards) he still is considered one of the best prospects in the minors. He was just called up but was hitting .275 with 9 HRs and 33RBIs on the season Yelich is considered the top prospect in the Marlins system and had it not been for injury he probably would have been called up instead of Marcel Ozuna earlier in the year. He projects to be an above average hitter both in terms of contact and power which makes him a potential valuable fantasy asset.  There are rumors that he could be un any week now so he is definitely worth a look especially if you could use some OF help.

**Mike Foltynewicz**

21, SP Houston Astros, Currently in AA

Coming into the season Foltynewicz was considered the 3rd best pitching prospect in the Astros system but with his performance this year he may make a push to move up in the pecking order(Probably just behind Appel since Cosart is already up) On the season he has a 3.06 ERA through 15 starts and has 98 Ks as well as 48 walks. He has a plus fastball to go along with an average curveball and changeup. He projects to be a #3 or #4 starter but with a fastball as good as his he could end up being a serviceable fantasy pitcher. He shouldn’t be up this year so he is really only worth a look in deep keeper leagues/dynasties.

**Garin Cecchini**

22, 3B Boston Red Sox (Currently in AA)

Cecchini has burst onto the scene with some great preformances across two levels this year. Coming into the season he was ranked the 8th best prospect in the Red Sox System but by the end of the season may even be the top prospect in the system(If Bogaerts and Bradley Jr get the call up) In High A and AA he has a statline of .344 with 7 HRs and 45 RBIs. He also has 60 BB in comparison to 58 Ks giving him an OBP of .455. He projects to be an above average hitter with average power. He also though has some speed and should be able to steal 15-20 bases in the big leagues which adds some value to him. The only question is what the Red Sox will end up doing with him. For the 3B and SS position the Red Sox currently have Will Middlebrooks who is a hot streak away from owning 3rd again, Jose Iglesias who somehow can hit now, Xander Bogaerts who is one of the, if not the top prospects in the game and Cecchini so what they end up doing in their infield will be interesting to see. He probably won’t be up this year and really is only worth a look in dynasties and keepers.

**Taijuan Walker**

20, SP, Seattle Mariners (Currently in AA)

Walker is considered the top pitching prospects in baseball by many scouts. He has had an absolutely amazing season with a 2.14 ERA with 117 Ks and only 37 walks. He is currently in AAA and while the Mariners aren’t in much position to be in contention come October he easily could be up come September, especially if he keeps pitching this well. Walker has a plus fastball and an above average curveball to go along with an average changeup which should be more than enough for him to dominate once he reaches the bigs. Since he has a chance at being a September call up he is worth a look in all leagues but without a doubt should be owned in Dynasties and Keepers due to his huge potential.

**Xander Bogaerts**

Current Level AAA

Statline this season (AA and AAA)- .311 AVG 40 R 6 HR 35 RBI 35 BB .407 OBP .502 SLG .909 OPS

Bogaerts was recenly promoted to AAA after a fantastic start in AA. He is once again hittong for a solid average and has started to show development of his power stroke. He still is striking in 23% of AB which is higher than the team would like but he also has 35 walks this season which is a good sign that he is developing a better eye as well as showing some patience at the plate. If he can lower the Ks and continue to hit well he has a shot at reaching the big leagues as a September call up as a best case scenario. He should be owned in all Dynasty leagues as well as potentially in deep keepers and projects to be either a SS or 3B(if he gets to big for the position) who can hit for solid power and average.

It was all ESPN standard points scoring at first, so I decided to draft a bunch of really good pitchers and not really focus on batting.

I was pissed about this and made a deal about it but nothing really changed, but I didn't push the issue.

The other issue is that, while most of us agreed that we didn't want anyone to stream pitchers (since most of us have jobs and school and don't really have time to focus on it so it would give someone a big advantage), nobody could decide how to do it. I suggested doing a start limit, but the LM didn't want to do that because he didn't want to risk having pitchers that start a bunch of games or something. I told him to just set it a little higher but apparently that wasn't good enough. He said he might change the acquisition limit (which I specifically told him I did NOT agree with, it was at 5 per week as is). Nothing was said afterwards.

This week I ran into an issue. I had two players go to the DL and two more players who I just wanted to get rid of, so I picked up three players, and then when I went to pick up a fourth, I realized that the LM had set an acquisition limit of THREE for the week. So I complained and the answer I got was ""Aren't you the one who didn't want people to stream pitchers?"".

It absolutely infuriates me to be in a league with a manager like this. Any other nightmare-LM stories? (Hopefully not...)",,False,self,t5_2quxe,False,,,True,t3_1cme4s,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1cme4s/cannot_stand_my_league/,

I did this mid-way through april and it got a good response with a number of people who responded suggesting that we did this each month. The idea is to give /r/fantasybaseball an idea of what the current trade market looks like in the fantasy baseball world right now.

Here is what to do. If you have recently made a trade or there has been one recently made in your league, you can post it and I will update the OP to reflect that trade. Hopefully this can give others an idea of the value that some of their guys hold and what trades seem to be working and going through right now.

Anyways, thanks guys and hopefully we can get a nice list built!

EDIT: I would say we should try to keep away from big blockbuster trades (i.e. 3 for 3s or 2 for 3s etc... because it can often be difficult to attain an idea of value through such large deals)

Razzball.com has their own leagues but we decided to make our own league using the same settings. Basically the goal is to have the WORST fantasy baseball team. It's actually a lot harder than regular fantasy baseball because you have to pick players that are shitty enough that they'll bring value to your team, but not to the point that they'll get DFA'd or sent down. When you see a player that may not have the best bat, but will stay in a lineup because he's got a great glove? GOLD MINE. 

These are the settings we use from the official league. 

League Rules

    10 Team Leagues, MLB universe, uses Yahoo! position eligibility
    Weekly Roster Changes (leaves you time to lavish on your Daily Leagues)
    C / 1B / 2B / SS / 3B / CI / MI / 5 OF / 9 P / 5 bench
    1,250 innings cap.  No minimum IP.  No AB mins/maxes
    We’ll be commissioner of all leagues and will designate one person per league to help arrange a draft date that works for everyone.
    Leagues will be filled on a first come, first serve basis.  If you want to play in the same league with a couple friends, no problem.  Just submit the e-mail addresses at the same time.
    Each league will have four ‘dummy’ teams that merely serve to draft the top players.  This helps minimize the damage for anyone who misses the draft and forgot to update their draft list.
    1 team per person.
    Collusion between teams is grounds for disqualification from winning the grand prize.
    Blogs/sports sites may have multiple participants but one team per writer.  These blogs will be noted in the standings and during periodic standings posts.  It is expected – but not required – for some quid pro quo mention of Razzball on your site.

    Hitter Stats
        AB = +2
        H = -3
        R = -4
        HR = -6
        RBI =  -4
        K = +2

    Pitcher Stats
        IP =  -1
        HR = +4
        L = +8
        K = -1
        ER = +1.5
        H+BB = +1

The point structure makes it so that about 2/3 of the league’s hitters as well as just about every pitcher has positive value.  So leaving a roster spot open or filled by a guy who plays once a week will hurt your team.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,False,,,True,t3_hbgno,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/hbgno/so_ive_been_doing_fantasy_razzball_this_year/,

Please see the link for the most recent update that includes all of the self posts about this league**

I have been speaking with the guys who run /r/narffl and planning with a couple other redditors. Everything is in order besides a couple minor details which will be figured out as we go along. 

So, the big decision of the day is what do we want to call this league. Some people have commented but no discussion has actually ensued. All I have to say is NARFBL is not an option..no reason to hide in their shadow or have people get confused between the two. 

See below for a couple ideas that have been bouncing around. In addition I will make a comment for each name currently on the block so please upvote downvote accordingly. Nothing is set in stone (even the candidates) so please throw out any ideas you have as well.

Lets get vocal and if need be I can make an executive decision if there isn't a clear cut choice.

***Once a decision is made I will create a sub and lay out all the details in more organized manner there.***

Cueto goes on the DL and Cingrani most likely will be called up and I see people talking about droping guys like Paul Malholm and Homer Bailey for him. Granted those guys aren't fantasy aces but provide pretty solid stats for a middle of the rotation guy on your team. Where Cingrani was sent down a couple weeks ago because he lacks a second pitch. There is no way he has developed a second pitch in those few weeks and will most likely be sent down once Cueto comes back.

Be logical owners. Don't let the hype of a player make you drop a solid guy who can really contribute on your team.

I'm sending R.A. Dickey and Jason Heyward, he is sending Stephen Strasburg.

We both agreed to the trade, and I sent my GM a text message saying that the trade is approved and he responded:

""He'll have to give you a draft pick or something if its prior to the draft,  cuz now the keeper/draft-pick will be off-set cuz it's 2 for 1""

I asked how this is, because as long as we both keep 5 players, everyone else gets dropped and into the draft pool.

""Yeah, but if you're trading 2 keepers for 1 keeper, prior to the draft, its still uneven.  Cuz you can't still keep 5 guys after trading 2.""

I reminded him that I wasn't keeping Heyward, he was going to be dropped regardless.

""If you're not keeping Heyward, he would be, so that makes it a keeper.""

I still don't understand the issue.

""Can do 1 for 1 and let him get Heyward in the draft...  if Heyward's available.""

I told him I wouldn't do that, because Dickey for Strasburg straight up is NOT a fair trade. 

So now he wants to ""table it to the league"" and get their opinion on it.  I don't see why this is an issue at all.  Is my GM being a jerk, or is this something that happens in other leagues?

1310112465.0,15,self.fantasybaseball,ijuss,If you're in a deep league 7.8.11,partyvanman,15,0,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/ijuss/if_youre_in_a_deep_league_7811/,"This is my first post in /r/fantasybaseball. I read every day and try to find useful tidbits to help in most of my leagues. For me, the most enjoyable league has been a 20 team dynasty league with 4 divisions and 35 roster spots. Most of the advice here is great, but I'm sure there are others like me who need advice on guys owned in 5% or less of leagues. So here we go.

Cincy called up SS prospect **Zack Cozart** today. 25 years old, and was hitting .310/.367/.467 in AAA with 7 HR, 32 RBI, and 9 SB. Paul Janish was sent down to make room for him. All Cozart has in terms of competition is Edgar Renteria, hitting .227 with 1 homer and 13 RBI, so it looks like Cozart will get a bulk of the playing time, with a very good vet to back him up and mentor him. He had a single and a run scored tonight in his debut, but also ground into a double play and was 0-2 with RISP. Dusty Baker did pinch hit for him in the eighth, and let Renteria finish the game, so either scooping him up now or watching for a few games is up to you.

Next, for those in need of outfield help, take a look at the D-Back's  **Gerardo Parra**. He can play all 3 OF positions though he's currently getting his starts mostly in left. Currently owned in .1% of ESPN leagues (That's right, 1 out of every 1000!), he's been hitting .288 with 25 Runs scored 5 HR, 23 RBI and 6 SB. He's been hot lately too, hitting .361 over his last 15 games. Yes, he's batting at the bottom of the order, and yes there are better hitting outfielders out there, but if you're in a deep league, there's value in a guy who's on pace for double digit HR's and Steals, and who'll score and drive in around 50 each too. Plus, with Xavier Nady and Juan Miranda sharing time at first, and Ryan Roberts entrenched at third, all he's got is Willie Bloomquist spelling him now and then against lefties.

Finally, we've got a blast from the past for those who need pitching help. **Chien-Ming Wang**. Yep, *that* Chien Ming Wang. 19 game winner in both 2006 and 2007, and won 8 games out of only 15 pitched in 2008 because of an ankle injury he sustained while running the bases in interleague play, Wang pretty much shit the bed in 2009 for the Yankees, was demoted to AAA, put on the DL for shoulder issues, and then never seen again. Where's he been since then? Rehabbing his shoulder in the Nationals' system. He's just started taking the mound again, and he looks good. On June 27 he went 3 innings, struck out 3, and walked none in A-ball. Pitching for High-A on July 2, he went 4 innings, struck out two, and hit 91 on the radar. Finally last night he went 5 innings for Double-A Harrisburg, allowed 2 hits, struck out two, walked none, and consistently hit 91mph. Obviously he's going to need a few more starts before he's ready for the majors, but that might be as soon as the end of July. And when the Nats wake up and realize this is not their year, Jason Marquis or Tom Gorzelanny could be gone and a rotation spot could open up. Got a DL spot open? You could stick him there and see how it plays out.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,False,,,True,t3_ijuss,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/ijuss/if_youre_in_a_deep_league_7811/,

So this was something I did last year that seemed to work to great success albeit with something of an imperfect formula. 

**The idea of this being to post some trades that have been going through in your league and I will update the OP to reflect the trades posted in this thread.** I will use my own judgement on what I believe to be Sell Highs/Buy lows/even deals etc...Hopefully this can give some insight for owners into what has been working in other leagues and may just work in their own.

A couple of rules here

* Post plausible trades only. We Don't care to hear about the trade rape you pulled off, this is for assisting in everybody's league

* Please don't post 3 for 3s or 4 for 3s etc... Simplistic, easy trades for us. 

I will hopefully do this about 3 or 4 times throughout the season.

So get posting and hopefully we can help out our fellow redditors on the the trade market!

**Buy Lows**

-*Cliff Lee and Tim Lincecum for Matt Kemp* (If Lincecum performs then even but Kemp a good buy low candidate)

-*Evan Gattis (sell high) and Annibal Sanchez (also could be a sell high) +6th for Matt Cain and 4th*

-*Chris Davis and Matt Holliday for Matt Kemp and Adam Dunn* (Though this may work out even)

-*Felix Hernandez for Matt Kemp*

**Sell Highs**

**Even Swaps**

-*Will Myers and Nelson Cruz for Max Scherzer (May be a bit clearer when Myers is up)*

-*Chris Davis and Huroki Kuroda for Chris Sale (Possible sell high on Davis here)*

-*Dexter Fowler for Austin Jackson*

-*Adam Dunn and Wade Miley for Roy Halladay and Pedro Alvarez*

-*Yovanni Gallard for Pablo Sandoval*

-*Alex Rios for Matt Moore*

-*Brandon Phillips for Matt Latos*

-*Mark Reynolds for AJ Burnett*

A couple weeks ago I submitted a post discussing the validity of value based drafting in fantasy baseball. In case you missed it, you can read up on it [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/199mkr/value_based_drafting_and_baseball/)

I got a lot of great feedback, some of which has been implemented, such as normalizing using standard deviations instead of maximums for each category. Additionally, this made the hitter to pitcher comparisons make much more sense, especially with regards to the ratios. Big shoutout to u/Unreliable_Source for that one. 
Additionally, I did also try to incorporate multiple sets of projections from fangraphs, but unfortunately, the main point of value based drafting is to compare across positions, and the format of fangraphs projections does not include positions. Unfortunately, I haven't had the time recently to manually enter the positions for each player, so for now at least, I'm stuck with ESPN projections, sorry! (thought I did change certain prospects projections such as Wil Myers, Oscar Taveras etc. to more optimistic projections from fangraphs that are more in line with ESPN's projections anyways)

I also added sections for MI and CI just for u/shmael

Just kidding, they're actually really helpful and a great suggestion for any league that uses those categories.

Also added is a column including Yahoo's default rankings, so now this spreadsheet can be easier to use for those playing on Yahoo. For those on CBS or some other website, feel free to add a column for yourself if you wish to compare.

Finally, I also added tiers to each positional ranking sheet based on eyeballing the differences between each subsequent players' value. 

Spreadsheet can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3UnZmeMA4wPd25oSTF1Mm1veUU/edit?usp=sharing)

Now, you may be asking, come on, it's been a couple weeks and you're telling me that all you've done is incorporate standard deviation and add Yahoo ranks? Well no, not quite. I also created this handy dandy [team stats spreadsheet!](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B3UnZmeMA4wPREZYa3hsSklMNXM/edit?usp=sharing)

The idea here is that you can copy and paste over players as they are drafted from one spreadsheet to the other, giving a running total of every team's total stats, the percentage of the winning total from last year's league of mine and how many standard deviations from that total each category is. These can of course be adjusted in the number crunching section to fit your own league if desired.

Well, that's about all I've got for you guys, I said I'd follow up and I'd like to think I kept my promise. For all the great suggestions that I didn't have time to implement, thanks again for the great ideas, they'll definitely be incorporated next year. Good luck and happy drafting!

Edit: 1B rankings were screwed up. Fixed it! If you bookmarked the old link please use the new one unless you want to have terrible first basemen!

Edit Again: Takeaways! For those of you who can't be bothered to look at all the tiny numbers. Pitchers to come later.

Takeaways: 

C:
Catcher is top-loaded, the reason experts have been pounding the table saying that you can get a strong catcher late is because they’re ranked poorly by the experts! Buster Posey is a borderline first rounder, Carlos Santana well worth a third round pick (ranked in the 70’s in both ESPN and Yahoo) and I wouldn’t argue Joe Mauer in the fourth. Realistically, you could pick up either player in the 5th or 6th round and feel pretty good about the value. Matt Wieters is criminally under ranked by Yahoo (99th overall) and if you can’t grab Carlos Santana in the 5th or 6th then Wieters in the 8th is a great alternative. Mike Napoli is the biggest wild card in the position, as depending on whether or not you think he’ll bounce back he’s either top 5 or at the bottom of the top 10. I tend to think that Boston and a healthy dose of DHing will be good for him, so I tend to agree with ESPN’s optimistic projections, which makes him a huge steal that can be had after pick 100 in both ESPN and Yahoo leagues. The biggest over ranking at the position is Yadier Molina, whose numbers simply don’t hold up to scrutiny as the 49th player off the board to ESPN. He’s much more reasonably ranked by ESPN at 90. Overall, I would strongly recommend grabbing Santana or Wieters if possible, if you can’t or don’t want to do that, just make sure you grab one of the top 8 catchers unless you want to bet on Jonathan Lucroy or Wilin Rosario exceeding their projections by a good amount.

1B:
First base is the strongest position in fantasy baseball many years, and this year is no exception. Because of the strength of the field, it’s harder for any one player to stand out much, which is part of the reason why Albert Pujols is over ranked by experts. His numbers are still elite, but without approaching the mammoth numbers he was putting up in his prime he won’t be able to justify a top 10 pick. On the other hand, Prince Fielder and Joey Votto very well might. There’s not a lot of surplus value to be had at the top of the draft simply because of how surplus value works (if your first rounder performs like a first rounder you broke even) but Prince Fielder should be the first 1B off the board in OBP leagues but is ranked third on both Yahoo and ESPN. Use that as you will. As for the rest of the field, there aren’t really many players ranked too low. In fact, as a general rule, the rest of the field of 1B is generally slightly over ranked by ESPN and Yahoo, probably due to the attractiveness of seeing those big power numbers. The two players most overrated are Paul Goldschmidt and Anthony Rizzo on Yahoo, where both players already have huge jumps forward built into their rankings. Avoid these players at 42 and 64 respectively as they need substantial leaps forward just to break even.

2B:
Second Base, along with Shortstop are the two weakest positions outside of Catcher. Second Base is spearheaded by Robinson Cano, who is head and shoulders above the second best player at his position (Ian Kinsler). Both Cano and Kinsler are ranked appropriately, however, the next two players at the position, Dustin Pedroia and Ben Zobrist, are not. Dustin Pedroia should be the fourth 2nd baseman taken in OBP leagues, and Ben Zobrist gets a big boost from replacing AVG with OBP. I would be more than comfortable taking Zobrist with a 4th rounder, a round or two above his rankings at ESPN and Yahoo. The combination of his value relative to his position and his dual eligibility at both MI positions makes him a target in every draft for me. Possibly the best value at the position is Dan Uggla, who’s AVG is terrible, but OBP is actually about average at his position, which makes him a terrific source of power at a power starved position.  Uggla’s rank is around 170 in both Yahoo and ESPN default ranks due to his killer AVG, but in OBP leagues, consider taking him up to 4-5 rounds before then, he’ll still deliver plenty of surplus value even at that spot.

SS:
Shortstop is the other weak position in the draft. Like Second Base, Shortstop has one player head and shoulders above the rest. Troy Tulowitzki is a borderline first rounder, whereas the next guy drafted, especially with Hanley Ramirez’s sheath injury should be Ben Zobrist. Jose Reyes appears to be overrated, unless he can get back to his 50+ SB days, his value in OBP leagues is minimized a bit due to his AVG being a more positive contribution than his OBP. Starlin Castro, while solid, also is not worth his 3rd or 4th round price tag. Overall, if I Troy Tulowitzki and Ben Zobrist are off the board, I’m probably not getting a SS until Asdrubal Cabrera due to the perceived value of the second tier of SS. Alternatively, depending on the results of Hanley’s MRI, it may be worth it to draft him in the 3rd or 4th and stay afloat with a late round replacement until he comes back. If his ADP drops significantly he, along with Ben Zobrist is one of the few sources of surplus value before the JJ Hardy tier.
Edit: Hanley out two months, bump the rest accordingly. Don’t draft Hanley in the 3rd or 4th.

3B:
Third Base is a misleading position. The average third baseman is actually the second most productive average player behind only first base. However, the position is heavily top loaded. Miguel Cabrera, once again, is head and shoulders above the rest of the position. However, unlike Second Base and Shortstop, this isn’t a function of nobody else at the position delivering strong value. In fact, Evan Longoria and David Wright should both be in consideration in the second and third round range. Adrian Beltre is apparently allergic to walks, and so loses much of his value in OBP leagues. I would strongly avoid drafting him in the second round where both ESPN and Yahoo have him ranked. With the injuries to Chase Headley and Hanley Ramirez, and Hanley’s much greater value at SS anyways, there are five players, the aforementioned top four, and Ryan Zimmerman before the position falls off…not a cliff, but a very steep hill. The Aramis Ramirez David Freese tier is significantly less valuable than the five above them. And unless you’re willing to wait on Headley (4-6 weeks)or Hanley (2 months) you’re going to have to pay a premium to get them. This is one position where tiers will cause me to deviate fairly significantly from my value rankings to ensure I can get one of the top five. 

OF:
Outfield is deep every year, however, in leagues that start 4 OF, you may find yourself in the Mark Trumbo, Chris Davis range where you simply don’t want to be. At the top of the draft, you’re not getting Ryan Braun or Mike Trout unless you’re drafting in the top 3, and for good reason. However, you can get big value from Jose Bautista in the second (he should be a first rounder). Andrew McCutchen and Matt Kemp are both well worth their first round tags as well. In fact, outside of Carlos Gonzalez maybe being a teensy bit overvalued as a first rounder when he belongs in the second, the only real deviation from standard rankings doesn’t happen until we get to Jay Bruce and Matt Holliday, who should both be considered in the early 3rd, possibly even late 2nd but are tanked in the 4th round range. Bryce Harper appears to be a bit overranked on Yahoo, but considering his upside, I wouldn’t argue too much if you took him in the late second early third range. Josh Willingham may be one of the best values in the entire draft if he can hit his projections, as his strong OBP numbers play very well in that format. Austin Jackson is another guy to target as I would be comfortable taking him in the late 4th early 5th and his ranking is in the 6th round on ESPN and the 8th on Yahoo.

For those of you not familiar [\(this is from Berry's article on ESPN yesterday](http://sports.espn.go.com/fantasy/baseball/flb/story?page=TMR120412)), ""the idea behind the Wandy Line is that it allows you to maximize at-bats and non-starter innings...For four out of every five games, your starting pitchers are not earning you anything. You are getting a zero from that roster slot. And considering you get only three bench slots in ESPN standard leagues, every spot is really, really valuable.There are some pitchers that are so good, so elite, so consistent that they are worth burning that empty slot for four-day stretches. Those pitchers are considered Above the Wandy Line.""

So essentially, the Wandy Line is a pitching strategy that relies on WAR (or VORP) to maximize wins, Ks, and IP via streaming pitchers and only keeping aces (those above the Wandy Line).  Berry lists the following as just above the Wandy Line for 10 team mixed leagues:


 
""Just squeaking above the line are Daniel Hudson, Romero, Brandon Beachy, Matt Garza, Jordan Zimmermann, Josh Beckett and Shaun Marcum.""

Now, my issue (and many of the issue in the comments) is that Berry caters to 10 team mixed (which, in all fairness, is the most popular format on ESPN) But many of us play in larger leagues where this strategy may or may not be effective. 

That said, who do you think is above the Wandy Line in 12, 14, and 16 team mixed leagues?

For 12 team (what I usually play), the next nine above the line in my opinion are Corey Luebke, Ervin Santana, Dempster, Colby Lewis, Gio Gonzalez, Derek Holland, Yu Darvish, Johan Santana and Brandon Morrow

14 team I'd add Jaime Garcia,  Hiroki Kuroda, Brandon Beachy, Ivan Nova, Annibal Sanchez, Johnny Cueto, Ubaldo Jimenez (don't really know what to expect from him), Liriano

I figured I'd share it here in case a few of you could use it. It beats the typical last-minute mad dash I typically make to try to throw a few things on paper.

[Click here to check it out on Google Docs.](http://goo.gl/evQ3K)

I don't like relying on just one cheat sheet from one site, so I pulled together auction draft assessments from 8 different websites. 4 of those sites listed projected stats, so I compiled those as well. I then averaged the auction values and projected stats. I also checked 10 random lists of players who were considered sleepers or undervalued and 10 lists of players who were considered busts or overvalued and added a couple of columns to reflect the fantasy community's general feelings on each player. It should at least help give me a quick reference point in the draft, which is essential in an auction draft where things move pretty quickly and there isn't a lot of time to think about your next move.

Here are the main columns with explanations in parentheses:

* Player
* Team
* Pos (Position)
* Alt (2nd position for players with multiple eligibility)
* Alt (3rd position for players with multiple eligibility)
* Actual (column for recording the actual value as the draft goes on)
* Avg (average value from all 8 sites)
* FP High (FantasyPros averaged 5 sites &amp; listed the high and low values across those 5 sites along with the average. I thought this was useful since each draft goes a little differently and it helps give an idea of a maximum budget)
* FP Low (see ""FP High"" above)
* SLP (players listed as sleepers or undervalued, with an X representing each site that listed that player in that category)
* BST (players listed as busts or overvalued, with an X representing each site that listed a player in that category)
* PTS (I categorized each statistic in 4 tiers - green = 2 pts, yellow = 1 pt, white = 0 pts, red = -1 pt. This is a bit arbitrary but it helped sort of give an idea of each player's overall projected statistical value)
* Columns M-V (Average projected statistics across all 4 websites that listed them. If a website didn't have a player I entered a value of ""$0."" I also assigned color value, which is again a bit arbitrary. For example, batting averages over .285 are green, .275-.285 are yellow, and under .260 is red. You can figure out the values for each stat pretty quickly and change it for yourself.)

I hand-entered all of this so of course there's potential for an error here and there. I also went off of the list of players from the first site I checked, which I think was KFFL. This means that some players like Mat Gamel, Adam LaRoche, Eric Thames, Bryan LaHair, Zach Britton, and Brad Peacock aren't listed. Some of these guys have some sleeper potential in a deep league but I didn't add them to my list since I don't think they're relevant for my draft.

There are 3 total tabs. The 2nd tab is a place where you can paste the row for each player you draft. It also calculates how much money you have left in the draft and your projected team statistics (it does in Excel anyway...I'm hoping that logic got carried over when I uploaded it to Google Docs). I entered statistics goals as well based on the average top score in each category for my league for each of the last 4 years. The 3rd tab just lists the websites I used for the auction values.

If you have any comments or questions, let me know! Hope this helps someone else 'cause it took me a TON of time to put together.

I also recommend going through and highlighting players with green, yellow, and red based on whether you do or don't want them. It helps to have at least 4 or 5 guys at varying price ranges for each position highlighted in case things don't go your way as you go through the draft.

Good luck!

EDIT: This is based on a standard 23-player team with 9 position players (1 at each position and a UTIL) and a $260 salary cap.

Last time, we discussed the values of fantasy forgottens like **Gerardo Parra** and **Chien-Ming Wang**, and Cincinatti's blazing rookie **Zack Cozart**. Today I will be profiling a few more players for those in leagues where a player owned in more than 15% of leagues still being on the waiver wire is considered a godsend.

First I will discuss notable recent call-ups, guys that should be getting a majority of the playing time going forward, and could have an impact for the rest of this season, and may even be worthy as keepers in some leagues. In Seattle, we have first baseman **Mike Carp**, a former Mets prospect who was acquired via the J.J Putz deal in 2008. 25 years old, Carp was hitting .343/.411/.649 with 21 HR and 64 RBI at AAA over 251 ABs. He'll be eligible at first base right away, but his playing time this year will mostly be left field. And with only Greg Halman (exactly, who?) there, along with Seattle's willingness to let their other rookies (Seager and Ackley) continue to start, he'll get his chance to prove he belongs. 

Next we have **Jose Altuve**, 2nd baseman for the Astros. With Jeff Keppinger traded and gone, nothing to play for, and uninspiring names like Matt Downs and Angel Sanchez as his competition, it looks like Houston is going give Altuve some playing time just what to see how he'll respond. Common sense says he can take the job and run with it if he impresses early on. Over 352 AB's in A+ and AA, Altuve hit .389/.426/.591 with 10 HR, 59 RBI, and 24 stolen bases. Yes, those stats look nice, but be aware that it can be painfully obvious when a player hasn't had time to perfect his offensive skills at AAA. Just look at Brandon Crawford's stats for San Francisco. 

Now I'll be talking about guys who either have been rostered all year, or at least for a while. First we have Boston's **Josh Reddick** currently owned in less than 6% of ESPN leagues. Before we talk about him, I want to get a point through to you. Let's face it, J.D. Drew sucks and is expendable trade bait. And I don't mean to knock on Darnell McDonald, he can be an occasional spark plug, but right now he's a pinch runner and defensive replacement. So who's the *real* 3rd man in the outfield? Reddick. He can play all 3 OF positions and absolutely took over in Carl Crawford's absence, hitting .365 with 4 HR and 14 RBI in just 63 AB's. Yes, Terry Francona is gonna trot Drew out there (for now), and yes, Boston just got Crawford back, but all that means is that you might be able to wiggle him away from an inattentive owner if he's not on the wire.

So you need some cheap power, or a guy with multipositional eligibility to use on Mondays or Thursdays? Here's **Juan Rivera**, owned in .9% of ESPN leagues and eligible in left and right field, first base, and DH. Since being traded to the Dodgers on the 12th, Rivera's started 5 out of the last 6 games. He's not going to give you the best average, but you know he's gonna get his HR's and RBI's. He hit 6 HR and 28 RBI in a sporadic 251 AB's with Toronto. Currently on pace for 12 and 48, I think those numbers go up substantially with regular playing time, especially when the Dodgers decide to become sellers.

Finally let's talk some pitchers. First of all, something is wrong with your league if **Vance Worley** is still available, and if you need a closer, **Javy Guerra** of the Dodgers is going fast. It looks like **Jason Isringhausen** is getting first dibs for saves in NY with K-Rod gone, but if he goes too, then the job is **Bobby Parnell's** to lose. But those pitchers' ownerships have been skyrocketing, so I won't be talking further about them. 

I'm getting a little tired, so I'll just direct you to the entire Nationals pitching staff. Jordan Zimmerman and Drew Storen are owned in your league, and if your league values holds, **Tyler Clippard** is owned too. Everyone else is probably available, and they're all worthy of a roster spot in a deep league. Like I mentioned last week, **Tom Gorzelanny** and **Jason Marquis** will be shipped to contenders when the Nats start selling, and the values of these vets may go up when it happens. Marquis is 8-4 with a 3.92 ERA. He's not a strikeout pitcher at all, but will be an innings eater and has the ability to consistently string together quality starts. Gorzelanny will most likely go to someone's bullpen as a long reliever, getting an occasional hold and a spot start here and there. **John Lannan** and **Livan Hernandez** will probably stay in Washington, and should both approach double digit wins with ERA's around 4.00 and WHIPs around 1.4. Not staff ace material, but if you need some back of the rotation type pitchers, you could be doing worse. Like J.A. Happ worse.

Other notable pitchers: **Charlie Morton** of Pittsburgh, who recently bounced back with 5 innings of shutout ball after some mid-season woes, Mets knuckleballer **R.A. Dickey** with 27 strikeouts and a 2.91 ERA in his last 5 starts (not including last night's 6.1 IP, 4 ER, 4K effort), and Arizona's **Joe Saunders** 3-1 2.25 ERA over the last month.

1373511795.0,13,self.fantasybaseball,1i20ez,ESPN H2H Points Analytics Update!,depressiown,15,2,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1i20ez/espn_h2h_points_analytics_update/,"Howdy folks!

A few months ago, [I posted about](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1chkyz/espn_h2h_points_analytics/) creating some sort of application for some deeper fantasy analytics. The impetus was for my own league, so I'm starting with H2H Points on ESPN for now. Because of the complexities of scraping a website for data and the differences between league types, I'm mostly sticking to that for now. Additionally, it's just something I'm doing in my spare time, so there have been weeks where I've done absolutely nothing.

Anyway, it's at a point where I can scrape all the statistical data from an ESPN H2H Points league and stick it in a database. Once it's in there, I can query and manipulate the data in any way, shape, or form and (potentially) visualize it using a graphing tool called D3. The data scraping is done, and I've begun the query/manipulation aspect of it.

So far, the only analytical thing I've done is the ""bad luck"" rate. This is a measure of how well your opponents do relative to their average. For example, if your opponent scores +20 over their season weekly average, you have bad luck.

Since this is done, I thought I'd give anyone who wants to know who's lucky in their league (or to confirm their suspicions) a little taste. I'll simply need your league URL to get you your bad luck rates, but **it must be a ESPN head-to-head points league**.

Using [my league](http://games.espn.go.com/flb/leagueoffice?leagueId=49723&amp;seasonId=2013) as an example, here are our bad luck rates so far:

1. The Masterbatters: 15.719 
2. Steroids Still Rule: 10.526 
3. Small Balls: 10.209 
4. AnEffin Travisty: 8.577 
5. Terribly Awesome: 6.643 
6. Kellogg's Pornflakes: 5.474 
7. ReturnOfThe ZealotH0rde: -0.403 
8. Из России С Любовью: -14.852 
9. Bobby Coxsters: -15.260 
10. Buster's Girl: -26.633 

The Masterbatters are unlucky and Buster's Girl is the luckiest.

What should I do next? I was thinking of player standard deviations, bench rot, or begin the graphical visualizations on the website (which is secret right now). What would be useful to you?

**TL;DR:** Doing fantasy analytics for ESPN head-to-head points leagues. Give me your league URL, and I'll give you your league bad luck rates (and more later)!

**Edit**: Need to reiterate: this is for ESPN head-to-head **points** leagues, not categories. Also, it needs to be public.

**Edit 2**: Keep 'em coming. Got two in the queue (""Infield Fly Rule"" and ""Fanatic Fantasy League Baseball""). This is great because I'm identifying a few bugs with different league configurations. It generally goes pretty quick (scraping hundreds of pages can only be so fast) assuming no bugs... but so far, my bug-free record hasn't been good.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1373524785.0,,,True,t3_1i20ez,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1i20ez/espn_h2h_points_analytics_update/,

We have days where not a single probable starter is available for pickup. Everyone is asking for good pitchers in trades for position players and no-one is giving them up.

Since 4 of my 5 first picks in the draft were pitchers I'm fine with the pitching shortage and I picked Corbin up off waivers too. He seems like the perfect sell high candidate with a 6-0 record and 1.52 ERA. Most of what I'm hearing is that he's due to correct to around a 3 ERA from now due to an unsustainable LOB% and today's start kind of showed that he’s been lucky with a lot of double plays and line drives straight to infielders getting him out of jams while walking 5 batters in 7IP.

A guy in my league is desperate for pitching offered Sandoval up for a good SP which no-one took. I already own Miggy at 3B so I'm fine in that position but I thought about seeing if he would take Corbin and trade Sandoval for a position I need more. I'm thinking about seeing if he would take it. Corbin is my highest scoring player so I'm reluctant to let him go, and a good pitcher is worth so much more than a good hitter as there is at least depth on the waiver wire to replace a hitter if you need. 

What are your thoughts? Am I crazy to expect him to make this trade, should I ask for even more? I am horrible with telling with these things. Thanks!

Never posted a link before so I'm not really sure how but here are my stats for the day.

The teams in 3rd and 17th places just worked out this trade:

3rd place team GETS: Carlos Ruiz, Adam Dunn, Martin Prado, Corey Hart, Shane Victorino, Matt Garza, Ryan Dempster, Jonathan Papelbon and Ryan Cook

17th place team GETS: Evan Longoria

I don't think it's collusion per se, because ostensibly both teams are doing what's ""best"" for them...but on the other hand, HOLY SHIT.  In a league where pretty much anybody with regular playing time has value, it makes the 3rd place team stacked to hell...but the 17th place team is getting an upgrade to their 4th keeper, so it technically makes sense.  It's just so absurdly lopsided though that I feel like it has to be vetoed.  Thoughts?

EDIT: Allowing it, much to my league's chagrin.  Just about everyone (including the teams involved in the trade oddly enough) agree trades like this are against the spirit of the league and extreme dumping will be outlawed next year.

I wanted to let you all know that this is one of the last times that he may still be available in such leagues, and that it is a good time to start adding him to keeper rosters.  Right now he has 61 stolen bases in 52 games, with a 329/411/463 slash line.  

Hamilton stole 103 bases last season, and has been significantly more impressive this year.  He is actually on pace to push for 150+ steals in a season, and to compete for minor league records.  His speed is said to break through the 20-80 scouting scale, and he is the fastest player in baseball.  But, more importantly, he has developed an ability to get on base, and it isn't entirely a california league mirage.  

Billy has started walking at a very solid clip for a young leadoff hitter type, and has the ability to be a solid 270/360/400 player in the majors.  While those numbers aren't terribly impressive in their own, he could also be an 80+ steal player with regular at bats in the bigs, and still has a chance at sticking at SS.  This would be a fantasy stud.

He is not major league ready, but he could be called up for pinch running duties if the Reds are still in the hunt in September.  If you are in a very deep league, especially one with a lot of keeper spots, it is worth considering adding him now.  He may not be a sexy name like Bryce Harper, but if he sticks at short stop his fantasy value will not be too much lower.

I use rotoworld's position tiers and combine them into a single chart. I've added in k/9 last year and K:BB for this season.

I like the color coding because it makes it easier for me to notice potential runs on a given position and some better value in picks.

Can anyone think of any other stats or changes I could make that might make this better?

It takes courage to share your painful fantasy baseball experiences with a group!

I think my worst move so far might have been this one, which I made early in the year:

**My Stupid Trade**:

    I trade: OF Lance Berkman, SP Bud Norris, SP Anibal Sanchez
    I receive: 1B Adam Lind

**My stupid reasoning**:

I did this in a very deep league. My reasoning was this: (1) Lance Berkman was slumping, and coming off a terrible year in New York and an injury risk, (2) I was in a points league where it didn't matter if Norris gets Ks if he also gave up tons of walks and got slammed every other outing and (3) I read somewhere that Anibal Sanchez projects as a #3 pitcher at best and used that as a reason to discount him.

**The stupid aftermath**:

Shortly after that trade, Berkman caught fire, Sanchez nearly threw a no-hitter (which he almost did again today), and Norris eventually got his walks under control. I was just so eager to ""buy low"" on Adam Lind that I significantly overpaid for him and gave away a possible top 10 hitter. And I rationalized away Norris and Sanchez thinking pitchers of that caliber were replaceable from the waiver wire.

It really needs to stop.

Let me outline the 4 most asked questions -

* Should I keep (propect here) over (established player here) -- **No.** If you're deciding between Oscar Taveras and Adam Jones, BJ Upton and Michael Bourn... who do you think is going to provide more in the next 3 years? The guy who's never taken an at-bat in the major leagues or the guy who's been there for years?

* I have 5 keepers. Should I keep Jurickson Profar? **What the hell?** You have 5 keepers. The point of a keeper is to get the highest value pick to keep into the next year. If you do it right you should end up with 5 1st-3rd rounders, not 5 sub-200 ADP players, regardless of how highly touted they are. Profar is a highly touted prospect because of his outstanding fielding work at the most difficult positions.

* Who's the next Mike Trout? **NOBODY** No one has EVER put up a season like Mike Trout before. Nobody will ever come close to it. There's a reason he is the #1-#3 overall pick. Because he is a one in a million player. The production he put up is the most outstanding rookie year when put up against the MLB averages that season.

* Should I draft (prospect here) in the 1st round of my keeper league **NO** If you have a small group of keepers, I'm saying &lt;6, there's going to be 50-60 players who will outproduce said prospect. 

These questions really need to stop. You guys can try to catch your lightning in a bottle while I settle for Prince Fielder, Adrian Beltre, Jimmy Rollins and Dustin Pedroia and take another championship home.

The only excuses I've heard for that have been that batters play every day and hence put up more points, and that stud hitters go early, so you need to make sure you have a few of them. But honestly, because hitters play everyday, you can gauge much easier how they perform day-by-day, and taking stud pitchers early makes judging their two starts a week a lot easier than waiting for mid-tier guys to fill your pitching spots. Stud hitters are a lot easier to replace in my opinion than stud pitchers. 

For example, I took in a 10-team H2H ESPN league:

* Fielder 1st (9th overall)
* Tulowitzki 2nd (12th overall)
* Hamels 3rd round
* Holliday 4th
* Then consecutively Gio, Darvish, and Scherzer 

Did I miss on the Headleys, Beltre's, Posey's, Bruce's and David Wrights? I see it as that I hit on having Gio, Darvish, and Scherzer in place of those guys, and take chances on younger, with lots of upside, hitters like Rizzo, Aaron Hill, and Cozart (who I took). I know this seems like a rant, but I am just questioning why taking multiple stud pitchers early has seen backlash here... 

Edit: For reference heres my first 20 picks:
(9) Fielder 1B, (12) Tulowitzki SS, Hamels SP, Matt Holliday OF, Gio Gonzalez SP, Yu Darvish SP,  Max Scherzer SP, Aramis Ramirez 3B, Aaron Hill 2B, Jonathon Papelbon RP, Rafael Soriano RP, Anthony Rizzo 1B/3B, Angel Pagan OF, Jeremy Hellickson SP, Chris Perez RP, Josh Reddick OF,  Norichika Aoki OF, Zack Cozart 2B/SS, Jesus Montero C, Garrett Jones 1B/OF.",,False,self,t5_2quxe,1362451428.0,,,True,t3_19o2k5,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/19o2k5/whats_with_the_pitcher_hate/,

I then use the player rankings of the site that hosts my league (ESPN) to guage which players will likely be available at each pick, and script my draft accordingly.

Obviously, with this method you still need to read up on every player because you'll still need to improvise at some point. But it's a really effective way of building a balanced team, especially in h2h/each category leagues. Instead of wildly selecting the best available player, I'm able to calmly analyze the situation and say ""okay, I need to start targeting x statistic *here,*"" or ""I can get similar value at x position much later in the draft.""

It also has the added benefit of clearing spots for sleepers in a more organic way.

Team A gives Josh Hamilton and a lesser prospect to team B for Nelson Cruz, David Murphy, Ryan Dempster, Alexi Ogando, Geovany Soto and Martin Perez. Team A agrees to return Murphy and Cruz after the season. This would seem to help both teams in the short- and long-run

Is this okay?

Team A trades Hamilton and lesser prospect for Cruz, Murphy, Dempster, Ogando, Soto. Both teams agree that after the season another trade will occur where team A sends Murphy and Cruz to team B for Perez.

1338570810.0,13,self.fantasybaseball,ufuzc,Farming the Wire (Part 2) - Justin Smoak,DocEllis,20,7,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/ufuzc/farming_the_wire_part_2_justin_smoak/,"Justin Smoak is probably the most highly touted of the three players I am featuring in this segment.  Colby Rasmus certainly got his fair share of attention but it was Smoak about whom USA Today wrote, ""getting Smoak at No. 11 may be the best value pick of the first round.""  Despite this sparkling pedigree Smoak has failed to produce in the majors the way people had envisioned but things have become quite interesting as of late.


Most scouts viewed Smoak as a player who could switch hit for both power and average from both sides of the plate while also offering plus defensive tools.  The Rangers were high on the young slugger, who once drew comparisons to elite switch hitters like Chipper Jones and Mark Teixeira, but his big league debut was not what many had hoped for.


While Smoak did show some positive signs, including setting a franchise record for drawing a walk in each of his first four games, the struggles were obvious.  Through his first 70 major league games Smoak was hitting just .208 with 8 HR's and 31 RBI.  Then in a fairly shocking move the Rangers, who were making a serious run at a championship, beat out the Yankees for the best pitcher on the market, Cliff Lee, in a deal that saw Smoak shipped off to Seattle.


While the return Texas got for Smoak speaks highly of his potential, the trade coupled with his early struggles gave some cause for worry.  On top of that a move from Arlington, one of the best hitters parks, to SafeCo which is well known as a pitchers haven, seemed to further dim his once bright future.


With that said Smoak still found himself with an organization committed to him in both the short term and the future.  Often times a change of scenery is exactly what a player needs to kick start things and Seattle must have hoped this would be the case.  Yet we know now this was not so, as it didn't take long for articles to pop up in Seattle asking, what's was wrong with Justin Smoak. 


He finished the 2010 season, split between Texas and Seattle with a disappointing line.


Over 100 games and 348 at bats Smoak posted a :


       .218/.307/.371 AVG/OBP/SLG with 13 HR's, good for 81 wRC+ and a grand total of -0.2 WAR


One of the most troubling aspects of Smoak's debut was the spike in his K% which rose to 22.9% after sitting close to 15% through his minor league career with Texas.  This was certainly troubling but of course some regression in performance is expected when transitioning to the major leagues. There were some positive signs, including a healthy 11.6% BB rate, so many people still saw good things for Smoak going into 2011, despite the rough rookie campaign.


Unfortunately for the Mariners, and fantasy owners alike, Smoak's follow up to his rookie year brought some improvement but not nearly enough to call it a success.  He was able to get into the positive column for WAR jumping up to still paltry 0.5.   His wRC+ also increased to an even 100, but that still left him sitting between a notorious underachiever in James Loney with 103 wRC+ and Brandon Belt who posted 98 wRC+ in just 187 AB's during his rookie debut.


When all was said and done his sophomore totals looked like this.


                        .234/.323/.396 AVG/OBP/SLG with 15 HR's, 100 wRC+, and 0.5 WAR


After two seasons of mostly miserable results, the once promising prospect seemed to have lost much of his shine.  Yet one must remember that entering the current season Smoak was still just 25 years old and he still has time on his side.  With that said, the '12 season looked like a big year and labels of bust would surely be coming if Smoak couldn't start putting it together.


His ownership was actually at 55% of CBS leagues entering the year signaling that not all owners had forgotten about this once future star.  But an ugly start to the year, that saw him post a .200/.247/.325 in April, eventually saw his ownership dwindle down to only 33% by week 8.


It is funny how it works though, because just as fantasy owners were beginning to cut and run, something miraculous happened.  Justin Smoak, a man who appeared to be more bark than bite, began to simply devour opposing pitchers.  To be clear he is merely crushing the baseball, not practicing cannibalism, though that would probably warrant a post in and of itself.


Over the last two weeks Smoak's ownership has jumped back up to 50% as he has posted an impressive line of :


                  .313/.365/.646 AVG/OBP/SLG,  9 K's,  4 BB,  5 HR's  and he even managed 1 SB

Given the small sample size it is too early to declare a breakout but this is certainly an exciting turn of events.  Never before has Smoak put it together quite like this, but this is the type of production that prognosticators have been waiting for.  His overall line still looks fairly uninspiring due to his horrid April but if he keeps this up, Smoak's ownership is sure to rise. 


                     ------------------------------Going Forward--------------------------------


In terms of projections going forward one must factor in many things but the reality is that there is going to be a lot of uncertainty.  The updated ZIPS projections off the FanGraphs site has Smoak down for


                                          .231/.303/.385 with 20 HR's and a .302 wOB


These numbers however don't really tell the whole story since projection systems are not designed to incorporate the signs of a breakout, in the same way a critical mind could.  A projection system cannot identify the dramatic shift in performance and re-project a players production accordingly.  I do not mean to say that one should prorate Smoak's two week hot streak over an entire year and start planning how to spend the prize money.  Instead is merely wish to point out that the projection systems are ill equipped to project a player in Smoak's position and that owners should not overvalue the projected numbers.


Personally I would be shocked if Smoak did not top 20 HR's and I see 30+ HR potential as soon as this year.  The power seems like the safest bet in terms of Smoak's skill set, even with his home games at SafeCo. If you include the Smoak's terrible month of April, his prorated HR total for 600 AB's would easily eclipse the 20 HR's from the ZIPS projections, so it seems realizing the 30+ HR potential that scouts once raved about, seems well within reach.  In fact, if you prorate out Smoak's last two weeks, he would easily break 60 HR's over a full season.  So even if he cools off (which he inevitably will) Smoak can still be highly productive.   


Smoak's average on the other hand is a little more dicey compared to his power.  While he won't maintain the .313 AVG from the last two weeks it is fair to think he is better than the low .200 hitter he was over the last two years.  Smoak was able to put up solid AVG's in the minors including hitting .328 for the Rangers AA club in 2009 over 227 plate appearances, so he does have some potential in that area.  My unscientific advice would be to think of him as a .260 type hitter, a modest gain on his previous production, and consider anything beyond that, just gravy.  With that said I think Smoak has the potential to produce considerably more than a .260 AVG in part due to his sparkling pedigree and his project .300 ability as a prospect.


In terms of playing time, which is always key, Smoak is essentially a lock everyday for the Mariners, especially given this hot streak.  His home park, as said before, is not going to help his numbers and the splits would agree as  he has hit for a .188 AVG at home compared to .257 on the road. However I tend to think park factors can be a bit overrated when you are talking about someone with Smoak's raw power.  It may prove beneficial to bench Smoak on the road but if he is hot I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be worth starting at home as well.

-------------------Bottom Line--------------------

After two disappointing seasons Smoak looks primed for the breakout Mariners brass must have imagined when parting ways with Cliff Lee.  While his two week torrid stretch is a small sample it should be more than enough for a speculative pickup.  If Smoak gets ice cold you can always drop him with very little lost, but if he can sustain even some of his recent surge going forward, you should be more than satisfied with the results.

Expect his AVG to be a slight drain, but not Mark Reynolds bad, with some potential for upside.  His power potential is legit, even playing half his games in SafeCo, and 30 or so HR's, while optimistic, is hardly a stretch.  Playing every day and hitting cleanup for a improving Mariners lineup should afford Smoak a good deal of RBI's, albeit with slightly less runs.  The splits suggest he could be a good home/road platoon candidate but he should be a viable start both places when hot.

Some owners might opt to wait and see but that could very well leave you, seeing Smoak, mash for a different squad.  While this hot streak could come and go, cruelly leaving Smoak to fade into fantasy oblivion, there is enough evidence to suggest that this is could be a sign of things to come.

The time to buy is now.

**EDIT**

The upcoming series vs the White Sox should be interesting, as Smoak has struggled against the South Siders in his short career thus far.  With that said he will be playing at US Cellular a great park for HR's and he is bringing in quite a hot bat.  I would be happy if he leaves the series with 1 HR but I wouldn't be shocked to see more.

An interesting footnote is that Smoak's first Home Run was against Gavin Floyd, the expected pitcher tomorrow night.  

I will be going to the game tonight wish me luck, maybe I will catch Smoak's next bomb.

Cobb threw a 55-pitch simulated game on Tuesday (7/30) of last week. Yesterday evening (8/3), exactly seven weeks after going down with his concussion, Cobb made his first real* trip back to a mound in an official game with the Class A-Advanced Charlotte Stone Crabs.  

Cobb reportedly looked good as he went 4 innings, allowing 1 run on 3 hits and 2 walks. He struck out 3 batters in the appearance which lasted 56 pitches.  

The current plan is for Cobb to start once more in the minors and then return to the Rays' rotation assuming no set backs. That would mean Cobb is likely to start in the minors again on August 9 before possibly returning to the Rays around August 14 or 15.  

Cobb is currently only owned in 70% of Yahoo leagues and 53% of ESPN leagues. With a 3.01 ERA (3.52 FIP, 2.97 xFIP), 1.16 WHIP, and 8.2 K/9 on the season, not to mention playing for a hot Rays team that has been winning lately, adding a guy like Cobb for the stretch could be a significant addition to many fantasy teams. I know many people here have stashed him, but he's obviously still available in 30%-47% of leagues, so I thought this PSA could be of use to some people here.

Heyward - The ceiling on this guy could be as high as McCutchen or Carlos Gonzalez. He had a great 2012, and he is only 23 with as good an offense as the Blue Jays. 

The battle for me comes down to Bautista or Heyward. This will be my first year in a keeper league and I am leaning towards Heyward because of age. 

What say we FantasyBaseball Community?

EDIT: (Here is the tally after getting your guys feedback, THANK YOU VERY MUCH!)

Bautista - |||||||

Giancarlo -||||||||||||

Heyward - ||

Here is the tally. I think I will be going with Stanton if I still have the opportunity to grab him. I am 2nd pick overall, so I am hoping he falls to 19th pick (10team league), based purely that people are afraid of that lineup and his past injury. But like you all said, (and I agree), Stanton is an absolute monster, hes younger, hes better for a keeper league, and his value could shoot up to top 5 if he gets traded to a playoff contending team.

1338499281.0,9,self.fantasybaseball,ueijm,Farming the Wire: The Alex Gordon Example,DocEllis,12,3,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/ueijm/farming_the_wire_the_alex_gordon_example/,"Nothing hurts more, lasts longer, or clouds fantasy owners decisions going forward, more then being burned by a player in the past. Brutal betrayals can make us shy away from players in the future which often leads to overlooking rebound candidates.  Finding players like this can often make or break a fantasy team, affording you the opportunity to fill holes in your roster or grant you the flexibility needed to make trades that improve your team.

Usually they take the form of highly touted prospects who failed to realize their potential over numerous seasons. While many of these players will never fully realize their original projections, it is important to realize the value that they do carry. Many prospects need more time than some might expect in order for their skills to translate to the Major League level.

One player that fits this mold perfectly was Alex Gordon and his breakout performance last year. The player who many were calling the next George Brett struggled to live up to expectations. Over his first four years in the league 2007-2010 Gordon posted WAR totals (Wins Above Replacement) of 2.1, 2.5, 0.5 and -0.4 respectively.

This troublesome downward trend was supported by the fact that his highest wRC+ (weighted Runs Created) came in his sophmore year at only 106.  To give a reference point to what the organization may have expected, Gordon posted a wRC+ of 172 in 2006 his last full year of minor league ball.  His lack of production led to two minor league demotions playing 105 games away from the bigs between 2009 and 2010.  To sum it up in a word, Gordon had thus far been, a disappointment.

This all lead to the once future star dropping off the fantasy radar in 2011, the year he finally broke out.  While there were probably some owners who drafted him, most likely Royals fans, many owners were able to land him off the waiver wire.  The owners who did (and the Royals for that matter) found themselves handsomely rewarded to the tune of a 6.9 WAR season.  That total easily bested the total of WAR amassed over the previous four seasons (4.7 cumulative WAR 2007-'10).

The hits just kept dropping all season long, and the power speed combination scouts originally saw in him finally began to blossom, leading to a triple slash of .303/.376/.502 to go along with 23 HR's and 17 SB's.  That 2011 season was good enough to rank Gordon as the 24th most valuable fantasy player in 2011 according to CBS Sportsline's player ranking system.  While most believed Gordon was producing above his head it was clear that we had finally seen what Gordon was capable of.

I point out Alex Gordon in an attempt to illustrate the value of being open to players who still have upside despite failing, often quite miserably, in previous years.  The 2012 season has seen Gordon struggle to recapture his 2011 magic but the point is not to look for the Gordon's of the world after the breakout (when they are almost surely overvalued), instead you want to target players on the cusp of having that magical year.

Over the coming days I will spotlight a number of former top prospects who appear primed for the kind of breakout year that Gordon enjoyed last year.

                          -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The players highlighted in coming articles are:

Colby Rasmus - CF Toronto Blue Jays

While his year to date totals may not seem impressive you shouldn't let the numbers deceive you, the signs are there for a breakout.  Rasmus has easily been the best hitter on the team for the last two weeks posting a .311/.380/.667 and will look to maintain his red hot bat.

Justin Smoak - 1B Seattle Mariners

Much like Rasmus Smoak's overall numbers are not all that great though his 2 HR's and 6 RBI's, against the Rangers ( the organization that drafted him) last night, certainly helped his power stats.  Like Rasmus, Smoak has been red hot the last two weeks posting a .311/.365/.646 with 5 HR's and 15 RBI's over that span.

Jordan Schafer - CF Houston Astros

Unlike the previous two members of this list Schafer has been producing well through most of the year.  The reason he may still be available is because he has been dealing with a toe injury which has been causing his ownership to take a hit.  If owners dropped him in your league he is a great pickup especially if you need help in steals.

                -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All three players are trending up in terms of ownership so now is the chance to buy.  I will be go in depth on each player looking at both their careers leading to this point, and why they seem primed for success going forward.

Lucroy was the best C on waivers up until now, but with Kottaras heating up, that situation is even murkier than before with who will have what duties there for the Brewers.

I don't think anyone is saying that Ianetta is going to keep up this torrid pace in hitting the ball, just that he has the same ABs as Lucroy, but with slightly better results. I'd wager that Kottaras ends up squeezing an extra day or two behind the plate each week out of the Brewers, while Ianetta stays the same.

In regards to evaluating Ianetta, I'm not saying he's better than any of those other C, only that he's in a better situation to keep his starts. He also has nice protection in the insane Angels order, which is a reasonable explanation for his improved average: he is seeing pitches. Plus, even from his earliest days, many people thought (at the time and were right) that he was called up too early by the Rockies and wasn't ready.

The downside/question about his is why he failed to really produce in Colorado, but can do it in Anaheim. That's something that early in the season would be just wild guesses. You want to guess right/optimistically and get him on your team, then figure out why it was the right move as the facts reveal themselves.

22, Starting Pitcher Kansas City Royals(Currently in AAA)

Ventura has been great this season with a 2.96 ERA across AA and AAA. He also has 133 Ks in 112.1 innings and only 43 walks which is very nice to see. Ventura is the #26 prospect in all of baseball(according to Baseball America) and is the top Royals Prospect. He has a plus plus fastball that can reach up to 100 MPH to go along with an above average curveball and an average changeup. Look for Ventura to be a possible September call-up especially if the Royals need an extra boost in their rotation or bullpen  but he should be up for good and a permanent part of the rotation for the 2014 season.

**Gregory Polanco**

21, OF Pittsburg Pirates (currently in AA)

Polanco has had a great season and is now considered the #2 prospect in the Pirates system right behind Jameson Taillon. On the season Polanco has a .291 average to go along with 9 HRs, 59 RBIs and 34 SB. He also is close to walking as much as he is striking out (44/60) which is a good sign to see out of a young hitter like Polanco. He projects to be a average hitter for both average and power but holds some solid speed that adds some value in fantasy. Polanco does not look like he is in position to be a September call up but could make the push to be in the majors at some point next season so he is only really worth a look in deep keepers/dynasty leagues.

**Francisco Lindor**

19, SS, Cleveland Indians(Currently in AA)

Lindor was recently ranked as the #5 prospect in all of baseball by both Baseball America and MLB.com. He started off the year in High A and was then promoted to AA. On the season he has a .304 average to go along with 65 runs, 2 HRs, 34 RBIs and 25 steals. He also has a BB/K ratio of 49/46 and since his promotion to AA he has actually improved it with 2 walks for ever strikeout which is a great thing to see. Lindor projects to be a plus hitter but does not have much power. He also has a decent amount of speed and should be able to contribute around 20 steals a season at the big leagues. Lindor is the future at SS for the Indians and looks to make a push next year at some point so he is really only worth a look in dynasties and keeper leagues.

**Carlos Correa**

18, SS, Houston Astros(Currently in A)

With the season Byron Buxton has been having Correa has been overlooked a bit but regardless of that, he is showing he has the tools that warranted the Astros taking him #1 in last years draft. On the season Correa has a .324 average with 8 HRs, 68 RBIs and 9 SB. He is striking out a bit more than he is walking but for an 18 year old he is showing some great vision at the plate(47 BB and 70Ks) He was recently ranked the #9 prospect by Baseball America and is without a doubt the top prospect in the Astros system right now. He still has a lot of development left in him but his scouting reports say he should be an above average hitter in terms of power and average. Correa won't be up for a couple of years but he is drawing a lot of Manny Machado comparisons and is without a doubt worth a look in dynasties and keepers purely because of the upside he has. 

I would also like to appologize for the two week hiatus I had, things got a little crazy work wise but that job is finally done so I'm back and hopefully there won't be anymore hiccups down the road! If you have any requests of prospects just leave a comment or PM me and I'll give them a look!

For me:

1. **Mike Napoli**. Everyone knows the second half is his time. Red Sox are poised to go on a run, and Napoli (and Ortiz) will lead the charge.
2. **Jurickson Profar**. Disappointing so far, I think the Rangers will make moves before the trading deadline that will show the team that management has faith in them. Hopefully players will feed off of each others positive energy. Also, with Cruz possibly going out, players will have to step up and I think Profar will be one of those players.

Busts:

1. **Matt Harvey**. He's a rookie who had a fantastic start to the year. But the last few weeks his numbers are slowly rising, and the wear-and-tear of the game will get to him.
2. **Yaisel Puig**. Probably an obvious pick. A lot of energy and real fun to watch, but there's an element of luck to his game that will run out. That said, he's a great player.

1371313099.0,9,self.fantasybaseball,1gel5h,Theory: The Value of Middle Relievers in Daily-lock H2H 5x5,HanshinFan,13,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/1gel5h/theory_the_value_of_middle_relievers_in_dailylock/,"Consider the following two pitchers, and their value in 5x5 leagues.

Pitcher A, 2013: 97.2 IP, 7W, 102K, 2.40 ERA, 1.03 WHIP, 0 SV    
Pitcher B, 2013: 85 IP, 14W, 90K, 2.32 ERA, 0.98 WHIP, 0 SV

Fairly similar, right? Pitcher A has a few more strikeouts, but Pitcher B's enormous edge in wins definitely makes him the better contributor overall. Well, what if I told you that Pitcher A's average draft position was in the second or third round, but Pitcher B is likely available on the waiver wire in your league right now?

Pitcher A, as you might have figured out, is Felix Hernandez, who is having another great year in Seattle. He was drafted as a fantasy ace, and he's proving once again that he fits that bill.

Pitcher B is the combined contributions of David Robertson, Tyler Clippard, and Jerry Blevins this year.

While I understand that three roster spots hurts, have a look at your lineup. See those flex P spots that you just drop your starters in and leave there for the week? On days when your starters aren't going, *those are dead spots on your roster* that aren't contributing to your totals for that week's matchup. Wouldn't you rather have a few guys in there that, on aggregate, are more valuable than King Felix and are *absolutely free* to acquire?

The trick is to bench your SPs until they're starting, then rotate them exclusively into your SP slot. All of your RP and flex P spots should be closers or elite middle relief guys, to maximize the chances that you'll get a bunch of guys throwing that day and contribute to your matchup totals. This strategy only works in daily-lock leagues with no innings limit, but can definitely boost your totals in W, K, ERA and WHIP to elite levels if you can work the wire well enough to pull it off - again, at no cost to you in terms of drafting.

Let's say an owner drops someone you want, but you don't have the best waiver pick. Or maybe you're hoping the player slides through waivers. Now's a good time to head over to your trading block and make some changes. Switch up the positions listed, maybe re-evaluate your category ""wants."" Heck, do it a few times. That player you want is now off the Yahoo ""roster move"" listing on the main page. Sure, people can check to see earlier transactions, but maybe they won't.

Players with multi-position eligibility that play primarily in the Pacific Time Zone are substantially more useful then their East Coast brethren. Why? Because you can sit and wait to see if games are postponed/delayed or if a player unexpectedly takes a day off, and still insert replacements into your lineup. East coast swiss-army-knife players are still useful, but substantially less so, as most of the time they've already played when the NL/AL West teams announce their lineups.

Early morning shuffling

It's a pain, but in leagues with daily roster moves, always insert at your UTIL, MI, and CI slots the players with the latest games. It is worth the effort. How many times have you tried to rejigger your lineup, only to be hamstrung by positions already being locked down? This is particularly important in May and April, when so many games get rained out.

If you're too lazy to do that, at least structure your lineup so the western-most players are in your CI/MI/UTIL slots. 

Extra, extra innings

If a team played a ton of extra innings the night before, bench non-premier starters the next day. Even if they play well, they're likely to be left in too long due to depleted bullpens. Even worse, if they're playing badly, they end up taking one for the team.  I believe this has already happened a couple of times this year.

Disabled List Slots

If you don't fill your DL slots (and your NA slots), you are basically failing at team management.  Those spots should ALWAYS be filled.  If a guy comes off the DL, find someone else to speculate on.

I keep trying to get closers as Axford has been shit and Francisco (Mets) has been on the DL. I'm essentially down to one closer and I keep trying to get good-decent closers from Soriano to Rodney to Casilla to Chapman. Everytime I make an offer for one it gets countered with something like ""Casilla for Kinsler"" or ""Rodney for Sabathia"".

Is it just me or is this asking way too much for a closer? I need one pretty bad and have an extra SP I could dump but people are constantly countering with the philosophy ""He's a Top 5 closer, so I need a Top 5 SP/2B is return"". In my opinion, the value of a Cano/Kinsler/etc. trumps that of a Rodney/Chapman as in they're much harder to come by.

I really only like having one offensive bench player. Lately that guy has been Cameron Maybin. Do you think I should cut bait on Maybin for Ike Davis? I'd be popping Ike in one of the IF spots over Prado or, more likely, Reynolds (until Reynolds goes nuts. I just picked him up last week. I am expecting 20 homers down the stretch. Or so I hope). 

I can't really do anything to cut a pitcher right now. We have 3 DL spots and mine are currently occupied with Tulo, Lilly, and Buchholz, with Norris and Hellickson still on DL, but due to come off this week and taking up 2 bench spots. I traded Sale and Heyward for Lee and Hunter and I sure hope that pays off in early September when Lee is still going and Sale has long been shut down. Thanks for listening.

Dickey has 23 quality starts in his last 25 outings (with a 14-6 record, 2.32 ERA and 1.014 WHIP in that span), and 51 in 2+ seasons as a Met. In the past calendar year, his ERA is 2.53 in 231 innings.

He has only given up more than 3 runs in a start 11 times since May of 2010 (out of 71 starts). 

His walk rate has never been above 2.3/9IP as a Met.

Without his April 15 start against Atlanta, his ERA would be a crisp 1.47 this year.

To the eye, he just looks better this year. His rough patch to start last season was the result of experimenting on his knuckleball (which has paid dividends this year. This year he is throwing it, for strikes, at anywhere between 65-80mph. He's effectively transformed a single pitch into an entire arsenal) and a broken fingernail, which prevented him from gripping the pitch. 

Trade him away if you want, you can probably get plenty for him.

In your opinions, what is a guy like Lincecum worth? Even though he's been one of my favorite pitchers for a long time (not to mention the model of consistency) I'm quickly losing faith in him. The rest of my pitching staff has been stellar, and Lincecum has been dragging them down.

I participate in roughly four Yahoo leagues a year. All of the leagues I participate in are Roto and H2H, and all of the drafts are snaking.

I've experienced success in leagues where I was unable to attend the draft. I've found that the computer shows no bias towards players I would typically avoid. For example, David Ortiz went into 2011 as a terrible fantasy option that most people passed on; I snagged him late in one league via autodraft and he wound up being an amazing player for me, ditto for Jermaine Dye in his last good year when people thought he was washed up. Conversely, had I been present I may have done something like reach down for Carl Crawford last year, and that would not have gone over very well.

I've experienced success where I drafted players I felt good about and they wound up being as good as advertised. I've also drafted players I like and ignored good advice (Joe Mauer's health comes to mind).

I'm just curious to get some tips from people on this subreddit. How do you draft? What works for you? What websites are the most reliable for good information? Do you draft as best available or do you use position scarcity as a guide?

I enjoy looking at statistics and think that stats like wOBA and xFIP could be pretty excellent indicators of future success. Has anyone ever used statistics to create their own cheat sheet for drafting sleepers, and what were the results?

A lot of people are into this; I don't know much about auction drafts aside from one I did for football this past season; that did not go over well. I tend to avoid them, especially when there is money on the line. I find it difficult to bet on something I don't understand.

He hasn't been playing to his full potential, PED's or not, and we all know how well Chase Headley's thumb has treated him this season.

I'm a Braun owner, and my OF looks like this:

OF: Braun OF: Cespedes OF: Stanton UTIL: Goldschmidt UTIL: Cespedes Bench: Puig

From the looks of it, I'm overloaded and dying to move someone. But who?

I'm in 1st by far in HR's, so Stanton doesn't have as much value for me as he would someone else. Puig doesn't have a job guaranteed, and is at the top of his market value. See above for Braun. So which one gets the axe? Do I even axe anyone, what with Braun's looming suspension and injury, and Puig's current temp status?

I've been staring at other teams' rosters trying to think up trades, but I can't justify anything to myself. It also doesn't help that 9/12 teams either aren't willing to trade (seriously, if you're one of those people, why bother playing?) or haven't looked at their rosters since April.

So what do we actually expect from Braun ROS? Any trades go down in your leagues? Links to articles and analysis are always welcome.

But in my other league I picked up Teheran as a streamer this week and he is not eligible as a keeper in that league, so its safe to assume he will lose his spot in the rotation when Beachy comes back, correct?
