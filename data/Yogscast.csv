You don't care what the audience thinks, DON'T EVER STOP, you're on a roll. The controversial jokes, the disabling of the comments section (Which I know was partly due to the impersonators) the Civ 5 series, the decrease in Minecraft content, etc.

The point is, I just want Lewis and Simon (and friends), doing what they want, playing what they want, saying what they want, and not listening to the 90% of their audience who have nothing good or constructive to say.

*EDIT* 

NOTE, it is quite obvious that I don't really think 90% of the audience have nothing good to say, I was generalizing, something I'm sure many of you understand. However, apparently some people don't, so I'm just clearing that up for those particular people... political correctness man.. /le sigh

Also, at the rate he's going, should hit 1,000,000 probably sometime next month. 

Let's just take a step back, and appreciate how well rounded he is. Sjin has been able to collab with a lot of the other members, on both his and their channels, such as with Simon and Lewis, Nilesy, Duncan, and of course Sips. He's pretty diverse with the actual videos that come out, between the Sjips animations, Let's Builds, all the different Minecraft series', strategy games like Prison Architech, and actiony games like Hitman. Not to mention series' on other channels like Diamonds and Farming Sim. Overall, he seems to have hit an incredbile balance between being able to stay largely kidfriendly, to appeal to a big part of the main channel's audience, while still being able to appeal to the older audience of someone like Sips who is cutting people up in Hotline Miami while spouting lines like ""you bastard"" and ""what a son of a bitch!""

Not to point fingers, but YouTube Yognau(gh)ts are the worst I've seen, and most that I've met in real life are just...let's just say not very gentalman like. But you guys- You are considerate and soft-hearted to each-other and it's very nice to see and be a part of. Not to mention, this is most likely the nicest subreddit I've ever been on as well. You guys have fun while not being jerks and I miss that in the world [and Reddit].

And a special note to the Yogscast: You guys are just...sheer genius. I want to start off by saying how glad I am that you are around to do this. You never cease to bring a smile to my face. I'd mention you all but I won't for fear of missing one of you. There is only one critique I have though. I've noticed that you guys have been getting a bit on edge or disintrested...Please don't lose what the Yogscast was founded on- fun. But other then that, I'd say you guys are doing an absolutely marvoulus job at scritping, filming, editing, and whatever else you do to make your videos so good and high quality. Thanks for the hours and hours you spend making sure everything is crisp, clean, and beautiful. 
Keep up the amazing work :) -hug-

I feel kind of like a fanboy writing this but whatever.

At first I was kind of sad when I saw the schedule when there weren't that much of the ""regular"" yogscast crew (simon, lewis and lalna). But after Nilesys protessional strem, hannah and guests and so onI was sold, it has seriously been one of the most entertaining things Ive watched this year, all the jokes, the singing, the dancing with Martyn and Strippin, the list goes on.

But credit where credits due, and that is Sparkles* the god of livestream, he has poured his heart and soul into this and he has been the rock that has held everything together, and the hours that man puts in is just insane. I was more than happy to see him get wasted live, after all that hard work, he earned that little party :)

Looks like it hasn't been announced yet, so I'll go ahead and tell you all that we have a new list of [rules here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/wiki/rules) which can be found in the sidebar under ""Yogscast Related Content"" next to the FAQ link. Here's a transcript of these rules as of now:

&gt;1.) Check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/1ji9c8/ryogscast_faq/) first before posting.
&gt;
&gt;2.) Do not post baseless negative comments about any users, including the Yogscast. Constructive criticism is welcome, but keep it reasonable and respectful. Moderator discretion will be used.
&gt;
&gt;3.) Posts need to be relevant to the Yogscast. Keep comments in posts relevant to the post.
&gt;
&gt;4.) Do not post videos that come from the main Yogscast channel, we have a bot that does so. Timestamped videos are also to be avoided, unless they promote discussion separate to that of the video in its entirety.
&gt;
&gt;5.) Follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).
&gt;
&gt;6.) If you report something, and it is urgent - giving IRL information that is unwanted, posting links to sites that are NSFW/NSFL - sending a modmail to let us know will help us realize it faster and deal with it quicker (moderator discretion will be used).

Feel free to discuss them. Also, it is very possible that we will add to or change these rules in the future (though likely not anything too drastic), so make sure to keep yourselves posted. Thanks!

Edit: Official rules page now contains rule 7 regarding novelty accounts, and rule 8 barring NSFW content.

I remain,

I do not understand why people are asking so much for images of the person behind the screen, and not understanding why Zoey doesn't want to put a photo of herself on the internet.
If she wanted to upload a photo, then thats fine but I think that Zoey has made it really clear through a number of medias ( tumblr, twitter etc) that she has anxieties regarding social media etc.
I think the fans should just accept that, and not keep pestering on.

As a fan of this series this is very disappointing, but I do understand Simon and Lewis are simply to busy to record them.

So I have thought of a way to bring them back- nobody said they have to be Simon and Lewis. As the yogscast family grows there are more and more people who could join in and make a Yogpod.

For example sips and sjin could make an episode, or Hannah, Duncan and Teep. 
This would reduce the burden of the podcast on everyone yet still keep the fans happy!

I want I take this post to say thank you to the whole of the yogscast crew. I think I can speak for all of us when I say you guys have brought smiles to all of us. Personally (I had serious anxiety) you have saved my life.. When I was at my darkest considering the worst I found these two fellas who made me smile, they made me laugh and above all they made 
me think positive thoughts about this world I was so scared of. Come the Christmas livestreams 2012.. I am doing better ad facing my fears.. The livestreams itself showed me how happy you can be with the dream team being my escape from the scary world.. I am now 15 and pursuing a career in media. I have so much to give to the whole crew of yogs and the community for making me feel so welcomed you are all amazing people and you should be proud.. *YogSalute*",,False,self,t5_2sg86,False,,,True,t3_1ja17m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/1ja17m/yogscast_you_bring_smiles_back_and_saved_my_life/,

These people were chosen based on the way they've conducted themselves in the subreddit, outside of it, and their general history in reddit.

The process took a long time because, as I said in previous posts, we were looking for 2 out of the 3 applicants to be intimately familiar with the yogscast, and we went out of our way to ensure that the mods we chose have worked closely with the community for lengths of time.

We also wanted to ensure that, as well as loving the yogscast as much as we do, at least one of the mods had a bunch of experience as a moderator as a whole. /u/Scavenger3 is our resident CSS wizard, but even he needs a break every now and then. We'd also like to expand the use of /u/YOGSbot, and we can only have that work if there's a programmer onboard. It was still impossibly important to us that the people involved are a big part of the yogscast community, both inside and outside reddit.

As such, from the pool of applicants, we've chosen in no particular order...

[wait for it...](http://i.imgur.com/GKU7Udu.gif)

/u/pryomancer 

/u/nekosune

/u/pieiscool 

to be the new moderators, with us. As of this very moment I've sent out the invitations to the new mods, and the order they accept it in will be the order they appear on the modlist.

I hope that and look forward to the new mods doing great things in the community. I also am happy to have met so many of you through your applications. You've renewed my faith in the yogscast fans and reddit as a whole.

I've had something on my chest for a while.  I don't much care for rumors or secondhand information.  It's messy, unreliable information, and it gets people angry or sad when their rumor they believed in didn't come true.  It's also somewhat of a ""chore"" to deal with when answering questions, and people have the wrong ideas about stuff.

On the other hand, rumors can sometimes be used for good press or spreading the word about something.

It's the same thing with secondhand information.  Just because you heard a guy who said he read on someone's blog, about some guys tumblr post, which was about some other persons tweet about a casual conversation the people who tweeted had with Rythian or whomever via youtube comments, does not mean you need to repeat it, unless you have very solid information and know for a fact what is said is true and accurate.  People make up stuff all the time on the internet, and it's almost always bullshit.

For example, I've heard from various means, the reason SoI hasn't been released lately is because the server no longer works, the map is deleted, some mods don't work anymore, they can't find actors for all the roles, the map got ruined somehow, they don't have a solid story, no one wants to do the series anymore, they are in some sort of legal trouble, they can never work out scheduling, etc etc.

It's the same thing when people started the old rumor mill going when tekkit took a week or two week ""vacation"".  Some of the stuff people were saying ended up just being weird, and about as far from the truth as you can get.

**My point:  This is by no way or means a new subreddit rule, because this isn't my personal subreddit or whatever, but I'd prefer it if people would not assume so much or believe everything they read and repeat it here without information to back it up.  Don't get your hopes up or get angry with the Yogscast because you heard SoI or whatever will be released every day for 4 years because you heard it on the internet.  Just enjoy whatever is released/whatever happens and be entertained**",,False,self,t5_2sg86,False,,official,True,t3_1budch,http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/1budch/psa_regarding_rumors_and_other_such_nonsense/,moderator

Q: Where is Voltz or Yogcraft?

A: Voltz is officially done. Yogcraft/FTB has been put on hiatus for the main channel, as [Duncan] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI1UxQ7x2RE) and [Sjin] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogAFSiEX0_k) are doing videos for Thaumcraft and Farming individually.

So I really enjoyed the Starmade videos, and I would love if there were a series centred around it sometime in the future, with multiple Yogscast members involved, similar to the Jaffa factory videos. 

What would be really amazing though, and awesome to watch, would be if within said series all of the main crew were to build and then man a single huge spaceship, in a Star Trek/Mass Effect-esque fashion - to journey to the stars in search of adventure and planets made entirely out of pure Jaffatonium! It would also be quite easy to build a story into such a series, as the Yogscast are well-known for doing in previous series, with other yogscasters (sjin and sips? Rythian and Zoey?) building their own spaceships and striking forth to follow the good ship *Yogterprise* into the final frontier! *cue epic Star Trek intro music*

I don't know whether this would even be possible in Starmade (is it currently possible for more than one person to work on a single ship?), and I also realize that Starmade is still in the early stages of alpha and has a long way to go, but I thought I'd just put this out there for consideration for if and when a Starmade series becomes feasible :]

I decided to actually find the average age using the info in this thread. I took all of the ages actually given, as well as ages given on other people's behalf (e.g., ""my X-year-old brother watches too), and found that the average age of Yogscast fans, or at least the ones in this thread, is.... *20!* Well, 20.0888888889. Which is 4.6 minutes into your 20th birthday. Yup.

~~~~~~~~

I've just discovered this subreddit. It's awesome.

I hope this doesn't come across badly, but I always strongly got the impression that most Yogscast fans are little kids. The youtube comments are always full of people in the 10-14 age range, and the official forums (which are *awful*, by the way) seem the same. All of their fan mail from the Yogpod also seems to be from kids. But then after seeing this Subreddit, and the comments from the picture of Simon on the front page the other day, I'm getting the impression that there are a lot of Yogscast fans here on Reddit who are closer to my age (20).

So how old are you/how old do you think the average yognaught is? And what's more representative of the fanbase, the youtube comments or this subreddit?",,False,self,t5_2sg86,1349895498.0,,,True,t3_1179od,http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/1179od/how_old_is_the_average_yogscast_fan/,

The moderators have been in discussion for a bit, and we'd like to bring something up for discussion.

Recently, the Yogscast played a series of games called Race for the Wool - two teams of four play a Complete The Monument style map to complete a 3 block monument - generally three different types of wool, in a race format against another team. They both play on 'lanes', a MCEdited straight line of Minecraft land filled with buildings, spawners, and other obstacles meant to stop you from obtaining the necessary blocks too easily.

This game form is a very popular tournament format in /r/mctourney. Recently, the tournament organizers over there contacted us to help us set up a /r/Yogscast Race For The Wool tournament. We decided to gauge interest to see if the Tournament would be worth the time and effort invested.

Basic Rules

1: No interacting directly with anything outside your lane - placing blocks or leaving it, specifically - shooting arrows, shooting TNT cannons and the like are allowed, as long as it is done from inside your lane.

2: Basic Minecraft Survival - No special game-rules (keepInventory, naturalRegeneration, et cetra).

3: There must be an approved referee at each match. Currently only the /r/Yogscast modteam are approved referees. If you wish to be a referee, contact the modteam.

Here is a mock-up of what the Tournament timeline would look like -

Signups - Day 1 to Day 7, but if signups stop, then we will close signups early.

Round One - Day 8 to Day 15

Round Two - Day 16 to Day 23

Knowing all that information, do you want to play?

Cue the usual drama of Internet peanut gallery going off on a tangent.

In any case, here's the relevant thread on the [minecraft subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/raxco/peva_from_the_yogiverse_releasing_all_details_on/).

Lewis's side of things [is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/raxco/peva_from_the_yogiverse_releasing_all_details_on/c44g356) (which could use some upvotes, btw, to get it to the top of the thread).

It's unfortunate that this was made public in the first place but, since it has, figured we could use a summary/damage control thread here, in the place I feel has the lowest moron-per-capita Yog community I've found on the net :D

 As far as I'm concerned, I ""know"" Lewis from having spent far too many hours watching and listening to podcasts and videos so I'm quite inclined to accept his side of things. This will blow over soon enough and, as long as Lewis and Simon are still making videos then I'll happily continue having the balls.

This sub's been up for over a year now, and has been growing at a fairly good rate. It's seen the Yogscast change from just Simon and Lewis doing Shadow of Israphel to a full out company and family, with dozens of new members, new games and new ways of bringing us quality entertainment. I think it would be nice if we reflected that change. 

As it stands, the flair on this sub is essentially only Shadow of Israphel/Minecraft related. Although it still remains one of the staples of what makes the Yogscast, I feel we're leaving out the variety that makes us love them so much.

A couple of the most basic flair ideas would probably be:

* A face icon or at least something representative of each of the main 10 or so members of the Yogscast

* An icon for some of the more popular series (Garry's Mod, Tekkit, Orcs Must Die, X-Com, Farming Sim, Chivalry etc.)

* Something representative of some of the major events (A bee or a goat for the livestreams, something from the YogPod, etc.)

I feel like this would just be a nice nod to just how much our community and the Yogscast itself has evolved, and I would love to see some ideas below.",,False,self,t5_2sg86,False,,davechaos,True,t3_18rwdw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/18rwdw/some_new_subreddit_flair/,

I don't think I have laughed that hard in months.

Some brief analysis:

* Men greatly outnumber women on this subreddit. This is probably exaggerated by the facts that (a) there are fewer female fans of the Yogscast and (b) there are fewer female people on Reddit. 
* Most of us appear to be in our late teens/early 20s. There are very few children here, which probably contributes to our quality of discussion compared to the Youtube comments. (If you are one of our younger members, thank you for being kind, contributing, and for following reddiquette.)
* As expected, most of our group is based in either Western Europe or North America, with another small group in Australia/Oceania. There really are fans in all corners of the world, though! (I apologize for any confusion regarding my Western/Eastern Europe distinction. I am not European and did not consider everything.) 
* Surprisingly, not everybody is subscribed to Lewis &amp; Simon, although they are by far the most subscribed. Following them are Sips, Sjin, Duncan, and Hannah. This is more or less in line with actual Youtube subscription numbers, so no real surprises there. 
* A number of people apparently subscribe to YOGSCAST Seagull.
* Twitter is the most popular medium for following the Yogscast outside of Youtube. I'd attribute this to Twitter being the place the Yogscast members are most active. Many people also follow the Yogpod, despite its current hiatus. 
* Most of us were here before comments were disabled, but there are a number of people who came here to have discussions when they could not on the videos themselves. That was an excellent idea, if you ask me.

* The rest of the people would build their own cars to race, with weapons, like the robot sumo had

* The would obviously be rules of things like how many boosters and size restrictions.

By then making a resource pack + a map out of the sound files (maybe replacing the music disc files?) they could make a pretty cool behind the scenes, ""yogscast experience"".

I'm okay with this and enjoy the content they are putting out, but then I had an idea. Why don't we give back to the Yogscast? As a community of Yogscast lovers, gamers, and kinda clever comedians, we could put together an amazing adventure map designed specifically to work with the things we know about Simon and Lewis.

**Edit:** I have to admit I expected little to no response at all, but with even this small of a group we can get something done. If Prolougey can run a server, we can get started. I'd say maybe July 6th. For now, brainstorm on any ideas you have and I'll get the server up with Pro. I'll message you with the IP and the details.

This might sound absurd and I know that, so it's just a thought. So here's what we'd need.

-Someone who would be willing to run a server
-Redstone geniuses
-Builders
-Storyline (Writer)
-Crowd Control
-And all around dedicated workers

If we could make a cool adventure map, that'd be great. Or we could just make some sort of Arena alike Crown Conquest for them to fight in. Something that uses the materials from 1.6.2 and could create an enjoyable experience.

This could completely flop and never happen, I'll start work on a solo project, but it could be something cool if we could do it right. Thanks for reading!

**Update**: I will be out of town and be back on July 6th, during this time the server will be set up. Anyone can comment and suggest ideas of what to make and try to get this post more popular so more people can help out. Thank you for all the support! Once the server is up I'll send you the IP address and further instructions.

**Update**: Oh my dear lord Simon has tweeted about this, anyone interested in helping out click on this link.

The thing is, that on Martyn's recent video, ""[Minecraft Killcam - BEST GHAST KILL EVER?!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlDS2JdyJrI)"", he used her picture as the thumbnail (you can see it clearly by right clicking and pressing stop download on the video), but she never got credit for this.

We've both been trying to contact Martyn through various places, but no response whatsoever as of yet, unfortunately, and her youtube comment on the video itself has become the target of some people refusing to believe she made the artwork.

To be clear though, she doesn't wish the art to be removed from the video, not by a long shot, simply that she be credited for her work. I'm sure as well that given the oppurtunity to create more thumbnails for Martyn, she'd love it!

(this may turn out to be an essay),you_guyy,51,9,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/1gkbpd/why_i_think_the_new_comment_policy_is_a_magical/,"So as many people now know, comments have officially been disabled on the main channel, and the plan is to ultimately stop commenting on all channels (we know that Lord God Sips will continue to allow comments). 

Now that that's out of the way, I would like to explain why I think that this really is a great thing. Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that I have not followed the Yogscast from day 1. I don't and never will like WoW. But I HAVE been a loyal fan starting from the Minecraft days, and I've seen a lot of really, really, great comments. From the funny observations, to the fan-art links, even some of the quotes from the video have made me crack up again, even after I've finished watching. 

However, over the past few years, I've also noticed that the comments have taken a turn for the worse. If I had a buck for every time I saw some eight year old idiot (I don't hate 8-year-olds, just these ones) talking about how he had walked in on his ""daughter"" crying because Simon said shitlord, I would have more money than Trump. The decision to change over the comments to Tumblr, Twitter, and ESPECIALLY Reddit, is absolutely a great thing. Not only do we now have a nicer commenting format where idiots like me can write these HUGE posts (sorry not you Twitter) going on and on about our gaming heroes, but we also have a nicer community in general. I think that it's fine that some members are keeping their comments, as we don't have to scroll down every time, but in general I love their decision to remove Youtube comments.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, and I hope I can hear opinions from this, nicer, more mature community that is /r/Yogscast.",,False,self,t5_2sg86,False,,sips,True,t3_1gkbpd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Yogscast/comments/1gkbpd/why_i_think_the_new_comment_policy_is_a_magical/,

The way sips get excited about everything, the emotions he puts into his commentary, makes him the ""real"" guy, the ""best"" guy.

While studying, I need background noise in order to really crank out the pages of notes every week and until this past Winter, I was having trouble finding good sources of stuff to watch and keep me focused till a close friend introduced me to the Yogscast. Ever since, late at night, often till the sun comes up, I sit here doing notes and listening to the guys play various games, especially minecraft. Their exposure of mod packs and adventure maps gave me ideas of stuff to do with my little bit of downtime I do have and helped me think of ways to build models in MC of neurons and various systems out of redstone (unfortunately most of these builds are now lost due to high note turnover).

So now, as I sit, looking forward to the hard core studying I  have to do for the USMLE Step 1, I have to grin and thank Simon, Lewis, Hannah, Sips, Duncan, Rythian, Zoey, Sjin, Nilesy, Ridgedog, Strippin, Panda, Martyn, and anyone else working with them for helping me to succeed. Thank you guys from the bottom of my heart for keeping me working when I have hours of writing left to do. Thank you for keeping me laughing when all I wanna do is tear my hair out. Thank you for keeping me smiling when I'm on my clinical rotations (I do a lot of volunteering at the big ER here as I used to be an EMT before med school). Thank you thank you thank you.

Because of you guys, I am soon to be Dr. DAVE! and I HAVE THE BALLS.

I moved 2k miles to be with my Girlfriend after her mother died, with a pretty set plan in place. We had thought nothing could go wrong with this plan, so I felt pretty confident jumping on a plane and leaving all I know behind me.

Sadly, things didn't go as expected. We are still together, but borderline homeless. If we don't find a place to live soon, we will be homeless and we may have to move back to where my family is, which be a long trip and I know leaving behind everything she has will hurt my GF deeply, especially after the recent death of her mother.

Needless to say we are both battling with depression and anxiety right now (not to mention heat exhaustion on my part) and things feel pretty bleak. However, watching your most recent ""Question Time"" really helped me a lot. Sure, you didn't say anything I didn't already know or hadn't already heard, but hearing it from you really hit home. Something about the way you said it it sounded less like ""Well you know things will get better and you will be stronger for it"" and more like ""HEY! I know you can do this, I know how hard it is, I really do, but it will get better... I promise it will. Just hang in there for a little while longer, roll with the punches and when it is all over you will be much better for it.""

I just wanted to let you know that from where I am standing you have a special talent for making people feel better about them selves. Please never stop trying to help people, and please never stop making videos as long as people are watching them. I know I can't be the only one whose day is brightened by watching you play games.

Oh and a side note (or 2, since I have you here): When ever me and my GF see a truck on the road driving a bit crazy, we always make a joke about how you must be driving it, it always provides a good laugh.

Note 2: Please, please, please make Starbound videos! I have been waiting for Starbound since I first heard about it, which was a long ass time ago. I probably won't have the money to get it right away or the time to play it, so being able to watch you play the game I so desperately want would be amazing.
