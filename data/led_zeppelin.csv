Well...here it is.

I am currently 28.  As a die hard Led Zeppelin fan, I had always said I would travel to anywhere in the world if the surviving members performed together again.  They had never played a full show together since I had been alive so when I heard they would be playing London's O2 Arena in 2007, I knew I had to go.

Some of you may remember that the only way to get tickets for this event was with a code.  20 million people applied for codes and there were only 20 thousand seats which means only about 10 thousand codes were given out.  **I did not get a code.**

I found out through a few websites when codes would be e-mailed out and when I realized that non of my friends nor I received a code, I went on eBay.  Most codes had bids already going into the thousands, but I found one new auction with a Buy It Now price of $400.  I took a gamble and clicked.

Once I received the e-mail with the code, I was able to get in and purchase two general admission floor tickets to the show.  There were rumors that the name associated with the code would have to match the credit card used to purchase the tickets and only that person would be allowed entry, but luckily that never panned out.

Living in New York at the time, I booked a flight to London which I later had to change when Jimmy Page broke his finger.  My sister came with me and the two of us stayed in a hostel in London for the weekend of the event.

On the day of the show, we woke up at 5 in the morning to get to the venue by 6 expecting there to already be thousands of people in line.  Surprisingly enough, there were only 19 people ahead of us at the time.  Throughout the day, I had numerous people offer me cash for my tickets and my place in line.  The highest offer was about $20,000.  To this day I don't regret turning him down despite that being close to a year's salary.

After waiting in line all day with some new friends from all around the world, we were finally allowed to enter the arena and my sister and I managed to get a spot in the front row just slightly to the left of the center of the stage; right in front of Robert Plant's microphone.

Total cost (tickets, meals, airfare, hostel) - $1200 each

**Shepard Fairey is working on the cover art**

&gt;Fairey, a fixture on the global street-art scene for a quarter of a century, is putting the final touches to his first solo London show in five years. He is also preparing the cover art for a re-release of Led Zeppelin's back catalogue and has just finished a collaboration with Neil Young.

When I got back I decided that some Zep blues would be nice, so I put on ""I cant quit you baby"", live from the Royal Albert Hall concert (1970). I closed my eyes to listen, and after the song ended I opened my eyes and realized where I was. I was still just sitting in the library but for those few minutes I literally forgot where I was. I listened to every note played by Jimmy, every lyric and twist made by Plant, heard the steady and precise bass line of JPJ and heard the little intricacies of Bonhams drumming. I love that Led Zep can literally take you to another level of being a human when you listen to them. There more than just another band. They are a state of mind

I was actually surprised that on the In Through the Out Door question, In the Evening beat out All My Love and Fool In the Rain. I didn't know that song was so popular. I was also surprised that I beat out II for favorite album. I always thought II was much more popular.

**09/09/2012 - The 'FOUR' image** 

[This image](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244800351721631745/photo/1) was posted exactly 24 hours after [the 'FIVE' image](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244437971380621314/photo/1), at 3:12pm. The 'FOUR' image confirms that the images represent a countdown to September 13th, 5 years and one day since the band announced they would perform at the Ahmet Ertegun tribute concert. Also note the font used here is from the inner sleeve of Led Zeppelin IV. The 'FIVE' image used the font from Houses Of The Holy. It is looking likely that 'THREE' will use the font from the cover of Led Zeppelin III.

**09/09/2012 - The second Peter Mensch tweet**
&gt;it's almost here. I've seen it and heard it. almost 5 years to the day.

[This tweet](http://twitter.com/maindepowr/status/244574934775513091) from Led Zeppelin manager Peter Mensch alludes to the five year anniversary of the O2 show, as did his previous tweet listed here and the 'FIVE' image. This is the first mention of a release date for the show, 'almost 5 years to the day'. This makes it seem likely that it will be released in early December 2012, as the concert was on the 10th of that month. Reliability rating of 9/10, he never explicitly states what he is referring to, but us fans know that it is coming. 'I've seen it and heard it' is presumed to refer to the O2 show being released on both DVD and CD.

**08/09/2012 - The 'FIVE' image** 

[This image](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244437971380621314/photo/1) was posted on both [the band's official Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/ledzeppelin) and [the day-old Twitter account](http://twitter.com/ledzeppelin). No description was provided. Judging from the evidence shown above, this is a reference to the five years that have passed since the O2 concert on December 10th 2007. This is echoed by the phrasing of [Peter Mensch's tweet](http://twitter.com/maindepowr/status/222531923237552128). Many fans speculate that the image refers to a new album following on from Led Zeppelin IV, but this is highly unlikely. Several fans theorise that the image refers to the date the concert was announced: September 12th 2007, five days from the posting of the image. This image receives a reliability rating of 9/10. It was posted on official channels, and is the clearest indicator yet of an upcoming release. 

**07/09/2012 - The reactivation of the Led Zeppelin Facebook and Twitter.** 

The official Led Zeppelin Facebook page posted [this cryptic one-word update](https://www.facebook.com/ledzeppelin/posts/379653788773732) This is significant as there has been no activity since March. Couple this with the fact that [the Led Zeppelin Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ledzeppelin) went live, and we have definite proof that something is on the way. The [sole tweet](https://twitter.com/ledzeppelin/status/244194473217773568) is the same 'Hello' that was posted on the Facebook page, but this time with the #ledzeppelin hashtag. This hints at further developments in the future, as a hashtag makes it easier to keep track of news. Also note that confirmation of the Twitter account going live was posted on a thread on the official Led Zeppelin forum about the possibility of an O2 show DVD release in November, by the site webmaster, who had clearly been monitoring the thread. I give these a reliability rating of 9/10 as they clearly hint at something Zep coming soon.

**04/09/2012 - The Belgian news article.**

[This article](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:4GwPWMTqOS0J:www.rtbf.be/classic21/article_le-live-2007-de-led-zep-bientot-en-dvd%3Fid%3D7832707+&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk) appeared on the site of a state-owned Belgian radio station, which is, so I gather, a reliable source of information. Shortly after it was posted the author's name was removed, now the article itself has been removed. I give this a reliability rating of 3/10, no links to sources were given, and this article alone doesn't give any evidence.

**25/07/2012 - The Eddie Trunk tweet.** 
&gt;Heard from a very reliable source backstage at Aerosmith show that there will be some sort of Led Zeppelin activity around Christmas...

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/EddieTrunk/status/228294343281217536) from US radio host Eddie Trunk confirms some Led Zeppelin 'activity' happening later on in the year. Who is his 'very reliable source'? Well the likeliest option is Ross Halfin, one of Jimmy's best friends and also a concert photographer. [This diary entry from his website](http://www.rosshalfin.com/diary/july-2012/diary-july-2012.php) confirms that he was at the concert that Eddie Trunk is referring to. I'd give this source a reliability rating of 7/10.

**09/07/2012 - The Peter Mensch tweet.** 
&gt;today, Moulder continues with his stellar mixing of the O2 show. it's been 5 years coming and it's almost here.

[This tweet](https://twitter.com/maindepowr/status/222531923237552128) from Led Zeppelin/Jimmy Page manager Peter Mensch explains that the O2 show is being mixed by Alan Moulder, who has previously worked with Them Crooked Vultures. I give this a reliability rating of 8/10 as it is from somebody close to the band.

This has probably got to be one of the most dynamic, intuitive, psychedelic, epic classical-jazz-blues-rock jams I’ve heard by them. Warning, its 31 minutes but worth every second. John Paul Jones is a GENIUS. Jimmy’s playing is fucking incredible. John’s beats are fantastic and Robert is on point. Also loved how much recognition he gave JPJ :D.

I couldn't let myself find ""For Badgeholders Only Bootleg"" and not share it with fellow Led Heads :P Please enjoy and share with other true fans :]

1356750309.0,24,self.led_zeppelin,15ludm,The case for Presence ,,25,1,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/led_zeppelin/comments/15ludm/the_case_for_presence/,"Now before I talk about Presence I want to say that I don't think it's quite as good as the 6 first albums and there are more noticeable flaws with it. It also doesn't do many new things here either and most songs probably won't blow your mind except for Achilles Last Stand. It also the least dynamic Led Zeppelin album which may turn some people away and it's very stripped down compared to Physical Graffiti. 
Still after those criticism I actually think that time may still be kind to Presence as it was to Led Zeppelin III (not to the same extend though). 

First two out of the seven songs are just terrific, Achilles Last Stand and Nobody's Fault But Mine are two of the best work Led Zeppelin has ever done. I personally love Hots On For Nowhere also, it's just so happy and I have a soft spot in my heart for start and stop verses. Tea For One is a good song although not as good as Since I've Been Loving You even though the intro riff is kick ass. Personally the only track I don't like is Candy Story Rock. I don't think it's awful it's just not memorable for me. So there is only one song on the record that doesn't do anything for me.

Presence is actually the Led Zeppelin studio album that sold the least (not counting coda) and I can sort of see why since it was released one year after PG and the same year as The Song Remains The Same. But really I don't see why this album isn't more popular. Sure, I don't think it's **as** good their previous albums but unlike ITTOD which in my opinion is very hit and miss, Presence is much more consistent. 

Presence is in my opinion a great album and while it may have it's flaws it deserves a better reputation. I think it gets compared to their earlier work which makes the album seem more flawed than it actually is. When Presence peaks it's some of the best stuff Zeppelin ever done and even when at it's worst it's still better than some of the stuff on ITTOD. This is all my opinion of course, so what do you think?

TL;DR: I think Presence deserves to get more praise and recognition even though I don't think it's quite as amazing as their earlier work.

I see that lots of redditors talk about LZ bootlegs. Why not publishing our lists? So here's [my huge personal collection](http://gnuwarp.ath.cx/lz/) (99% FLAC, i.e. lossless compression format).

I don't know how many of you are interested in unofficial live recordings, but it's been my obession for more than 20 years and I've become some kind of expert.

I've been collecting Led Zeppelin bootleg copies of Led Zeppelin for 25 years. To this day, my collection covers more than 200 gigs. Among them, some are really good performances. Besides, the sound quality is sometimes very good.

During all those years, I often felt it would be a great thing if Zep fans voted for their favourite live rendition of every song played in concert.
I've browsed the web for similar projects but, although I found some *very* good sites about Led Zeppelin bootlegs, I've never found any similar project.

What we should end up with is a playlist for a virtual collection of live Led Zeppelin tracks. We coud even consider making 2 playlists: 1 for soundboard tapes, 1 for audience tapes.

The aim of this project is NOT to promote bootleg recordings. I don't buy bootlegs anymore and wouldn't recommend to do so. But as many boots are available on the Internet and a lot of people collected them from the seventies, I'm almost certain this project could be achieved collectively.
Needless to say, none of those playlists will ever be released on CD or any other physical/virtual media. Furthermore, no money will be made from this project. We like Led Zeppelin and don't want to exploit it in any illegal way. 

Here are a few rules I think we should follow:

* No selection of tracks from official releases;
* EDIT: No tracks with cuts and/or fades;
* One post per song and type of bootleg (soundboard/audience);
* Post should be titled like this: *[LZBLV][SBD] No Quarter* (LZBLV stands for ""Led Zeppelin Best Live Version"", SBD for ""Soundboard"" - AUD for ""Audience"");
* Comments should be formatted like this: *1975-03-19 - Vancouver, Pacific Coliseum - great interaction between Page and Jones*;
* Don't post anything if you only listened to a small amount of live versions.

What do you think?

1 I genuinely enjoy the music they make. While the four of them may or may not be the best in the world in their individual talents (vocals, guitar, bass, drums), the things that they do together (from subtle to obvious) are amazing.

2 I enjoy visualizing Led Zeppelin as actual gods that come down from some heavenly abode to release albums or play shows. This is an aura that I think they give off in how extravagantly they lived and the topics of the songs they put out e.g. Stairway, Immigrant Song, Achilles Last Stand, Battle of Evermore, Kashmir, and Ramble On to name a few.

Here's a list of some of those subtle things I spoke about:
Rock and Roll: Listen to solo but specifically this lick here at 2:07-2:11
Stairway to Heaven: Drums at 6:21-6:24
All of JPJ's bass playing in The Lemon Song (I wanted to cut it down to part where it's just him and Bonham's drum playing but I can't justify that)

""Going to California"" has always struck a personal chord with me, I am not sure why but I think a lot of it has to do with the longing optimism of leaving for a new life. Something about this song has always appealed to me. Anyway, this weekend I took a crack at covering the song...have a listen and let me know if you like!

Excerpt:

CR: Jimmy has been promising to deliver new material for quite some time, and has stated that we might see something next year, what is your take on this, should fans be hopeful?

BT: Yes I do think that they should be hopeful. It’s funny because I’ve seen the process a couple of different times and every time he’s sort of really gets on a roll putting something together, some sort of Led Zeppelin business comes up and derails him. That’s happened a couple of times, but I wouldn’t be surprised if you see something come out next year. I know he’s been working on some new things for a while and the ideas are really cool and I know he’s gone quite a bit of way to realize them. I think we may see something next year and it will be really cool. It will surprise you.

I do believe it does not has the band's essence, and may not be the best song overall, but I do love it! It is a JPJ masterpiece, whom I consider LZ's musical backbone. But backbones are supposed to stay in the back, huh? That's why we, bassists, must stay in the back. He didn't do anything wrong. He is the one Led Zeppeling deserves, but not the one it needed right then. So they sent him to the back. Because he can take it. Because he's not our hero. He's a silent musician, a watchful performer. A dark knight, *of bass*.

""The Rover"" (5:37) [2nd Best epic on the album behind ""Kasmir""]

""The Wanton Song"" (4:08) [TBH I only included this song because I had room for an extra]

""Houses Of The Holy"" (4:02) [Favorite Led Zep song]

""Kashmir"" (8:32) [No way is this getting left off]

""Bron-Yr-Aur"" (2:06) [Provides a great transition from ""Kashmir""] 

""Black Country Woman"" (4:24) [Can't have a Zep album without a song about being mistreated by a woman]

""In The Light"" (8:46) [CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED, found it works as a GREAT closer]

&gt;The whole rehearsal – start to finish. A lot of people are just going to be so very, very happy. There was one copy of it, which happened to be in my DV camera. On that particular rehearsal day, it was sort of a dress runthrough and it was decided that they were going to play the whole set from start to finish with no interruption. So I just stuck a camera, not quite a full professional camera, on a tripod next to me, for a wide shot. I think it was like, “Yeah, we want to look at this afterward, so let’s have a recording of it.” And that was it and it never even got looked at. [Laughs] So there was one standard definition copy of the entire rehearsal and it came down to, “Well, hey, this is going to go out, what else have we got?” Because we didn’t have much other stuff — we had a bit — I had some bits of the soundcheck at the O2, some bits around the O2, but none of it was that great, because it so completely paled into insignificance compared to the actual musical performances of the band. So that’s really what it’s all about.

&gt;We had this one copy of the rehearsal, so we’d looked at it, synched it up with the audio, of which there was only an existing stereo mix and matched it up. There was discussions about, “Well, you know it could be four or five songs — let’s listen to it and see if it’s any good.” And then the idea gradually emerged amongst the band and everybody – you know it wasn’t a slam dunk, as you might say, it was more like, “What if we put the whole thing on?” And I said, “Well you know, that would be amazing. That would be truly amazing, courageous, generous, honest, confident — it would just be an amazing thing for fans, to put the whole damn rehearsal on, warts and all.”

&gt;It would mean that it definitely wouldn’t fit on one DVD, it means that we suddenly go to two DVDs, but hell yeah, let’s do it. There was a period of time when it wasn’t definite and in the end, everybody said, “Hell, let’s just do it — as a gesture to the fans.” And really, understanding how it sits in counterpoint to the main concert, because of course, the main concert, we spent months and months working on editing and getting everything just right. The rehearsal, it was like one shot, nothing else! [Laughs]

&gt;It’s brilliant and of course, because of the way they play, it’s sort of the same, but also totally different at the same point in time. There are some beautiful moments in that rehearsal where Robert shouts out, “Hey! Hey! Are we recording this?” and Mick [sound engineer “Big” Mick Hughes, well known for his years of working for Metallica] yells, “Yeah!” and Robert says, “Fantastic!” There are some great moments in the rehearsal in between the songs as well.

Instruments, lyrics, feeling, anything related to the song would be sensible of discussion. 

It would be something like this:

[Song discussion thread] ""How many more times"" - *Led Zeppelin*, 1968.

Now I wanted to ask the community to vote or discuss some stuff:

- Want guidelines? As in:

    _What's the key instrument in the song for you?

    _What's your favorite verse?

    _What does the song bring to your mind?

    _The perfect spot/moment to listen to the song.

    _Where's the climax for you?

    _Do you have any personal anecdote regarding the song? (I know, this is a bit yellow but can spark some cool discussion maybe!)

So,for anyone who was looking..here it is......this isn't my work,so thanks to the person who did make the list.


First up - the tunings:

#1 LP - standard tuning down a tone to D
Gibson JPP signature Les Paul (I initially ID'd this as the Giffen LP proto-type copy, but changed my mind from later photos) - standard tuning down a tone to D
#2 LP - standard tuning at correct pitch (E)
ES350 - open G
LP custom - standard tuning at correct pitch (E)
EDS 1275 - both necks standard tuning down a tone to D
Cherry b-bender LP - DADGAD at correct pitch (D)
Transperformance LP - standard tuning at correct pitch (E) plus auto-tune craziness!

So the set, with guitar changes is this:

GTBT/RO/BD - #1 (down a tone)
IMTOD - swtich to the ES350 for slide (this is down a tone from the album, but this is the key they played it live in the '70s)
FYL - LP custom Black Beauty (same key as the record)
TU - #2 (normal pitch)
NFBM - #1 (down a tone)
NQ - #1 (down a full step from where they used to play it live, but only down a half step from the record, because the recording was slowed down by a half step )
SIBLY - #2 (unusual choice of guitar, but it seems they wanted to do it in the correct key)
D&amp;C - JPP signature - Page used this guitar for all the bow work to keep the main guitars free from rossin (down a tone)
STH/TSRTS - EDS 1275 (down a tone)
MMH - #2 (normal pitch)
Kashmir - cherry b-bender LP (normal pitch)
WLL - transperformance LP (normal pitch)
R&amp;R - #1 (down a tone)",,False,self,t5_2shnv,False,,,True,t3_1760mx,http://www.reddit.com/r/led_zeppelin/comments/1760mx/celebration_day_guitar_tuningsset_list/,

Black Dog

Rock And Roll

Heartbreaker -- this is probably my favorite transition

Living Loving Maid

Ramble On

Babe I'm Gonna Leave You

Dazed And Confused

Whole Lotta Love

Achilles Last Stand

In My Time Of Dying

Bron Y Aur Stomp -- this is where the mood starts to wind down 

Hey Hey What Can I Do

Tangerine

The Rain Song

Stairway To Heaven
                        
Going To California

When The Levee Breaks

It is my opinion that the last three make up the greatest three-song stretch on the list.

Me: Remember those Led Zeppelin concerts you said you went to in like, '79?

My personal favorite is their performance of [Communication Breakdown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqF3J8DpEb4&amp;ob=av3n) at Royal Albert Hall. I just love when Plant walks out in the beginning and clearly has no idea what is going on haha. And then Jimmy has an incredible solo in it, and finally, I love the shot of the fans in the front row during the solo around 1:25 where they're all just smashing on the stage going nuts.
