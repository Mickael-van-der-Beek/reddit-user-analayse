Before his controversial AMA, [/r/teslore](/r/teslore) was a mere village with 500 subscribers. Although people were quick to criticise his knowledge, his post has single-handedly tripled this subreddit's scholar count. I think that one thread has made this sub what it is today.

His name is Timothy, also known as MisledDarkness.

I think I speak for all of [/r/teslore](/r/teslore) when I offer my deepest condolences to his family.

May he rest in peace.

Never forget.

1349795606.0,263,self.teslore,1175nc,The Mysterious Case of Rorikstead [Conjecture-heavy],,304,41,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1175nc/the_mysterious_case_of_rorikstead_conjectureheavy/,"This spawned out of a thread over in /r/skyrim about some odd things /u/rohanivey noticed in Rorikstead.

The OP:

""Okay, I've gone over this several times and came to reddit looking for advice. We all know of the various conflicts involving Rorikstead as it stands and the lore from books, the Great War, the songs, etc.

My proposal: Rorikstead is really the greatest secret cult in the game

Here's what I've found so far:

* In all the main houses there are soul gems. Really odd for farmers.

* Rorikstead used to be a shithole where you couldn't grow dirt. This has since changed drastically to Rorikstead having the best dirt in Skyrim, to the point of new citizens considering selling top soil for the first time in Tamriel history.

* The old codger responsible for meeting and greeting people is wizard as fuck. If you hang out in the Mayor's house during dinner you can see Gramps talking with the mayor's daughter talking about learning new magic. He beckons her to keep quiet about the entire issue.

* The old bastard also has some hardcore Daedra worship books on him and in the mayor's house (Where he lives)

The conclusion I've come to is that this is the real Rorikstead, half the people here are way older than they should be, Daedra worship is involved, and there's nary a quest to be seen at all in that town.""

.

Now, I did a good bit of digging on this in that thread, and some more later.

My comment: 

""There's also the dead guy getting chewed on by Skeevers a short walk from town.

I think you might be onto something. I'm going to dig around TIL and see what I can find. Be back later.

Okay, I'm back. There's almost nothing on Rorikstead on TIL, which is odd in and of itself. Of course, there's the two Song books that have *Ragnar the Red*, mentioning Rorikstead as ""ole Rorikstead"".

Anyway, the first thing I've found that's even slightly out of the ordinary is [the Atlas of Dragons](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/atlas-dragons). It tells of the dragon Nahagliiv (Fury Burn Wither), who is buried in the dragon mound to the west of Rorikstead. He pops up to say hello once you've done A Blade in the Dark and head in his general direction, I think. That's literally the only thing interesting on Rorikstead, including the forum thread for Skyrim in general.

So then I searched Rorik. There's one entry, [The Holdings of Jarl Gjalund](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/holdings-jarl-gjalund). It's dated to the first era, and lists a Rorik's Steading as a small farmstead in the western part of the plains.

This is a bit odd, since there's a [character named Rorik alive and well in Rorikstead.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rorik) I knew you mentioned him, OP, but it's a bit fishy. He mentions fighting in the Great War, buying up the land, and miraculously making a profitable farm out of it. Yet in that book, dated sometime in the First Era, likely fairly soon after the Dragon War, a Rorik has a Steading, a Farmstead. Now, either the land was left barren for years, and another Rorik coincidentally bought it up thousands of years later and did the exact same thing, or something's rotten in Rorikstead.

It should be noted that the [UESP is a bit suspicious of Rorik as well](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_talk:Rorik). 

On the subject of Lokir, the UESP notes that ""Strangely, nobody in Rorikstead seems to know or care about Lokir."", and the [talk page](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_talk:Lokir) has an interesting link to [Bethesda's Creation Kit Preview video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udM4VvSL2VA), which shows a location called Lokir's Tomb being edited. It's a pretty fleshed out tomb, by the looks of things.

So now, we come full circle. I think we've stumbled onto the next DLC, at least in part. The story of Rorikstead is incredibly fishy, and Bethesda put a video up of them making a location called Lokir's Tomb. If it were just one or just the other, I'd attribute it to just being a joke, but the two together suggest that we're going to be seeing a lot more of Rorikstead in the future.""

I also asked for permission to post this here, which he gave.

.

I checked around for more information on Lund:

""Welp, [UESP](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lund) suggests he was keeping skeevers as pets, and/or killed himself with poison because of his wife's death. Still, odd that nothing about him ever shows up in Rorikstead.""

.

Now then, on to the main bit of investigation I did in-game. This is going to be image-heavy, as a warning.

[Here's the album of all the images. They're not sorted, so be warned.](http://imgur.com/a/hTGss)

First, I [explored](http://i.imgur.com/Wp5kh.jpg) [Rorik's](http://i.imgur.com/3qsFc.jpg) [Manor](http://i.imgur.com/b0wUp.jpg). As you can see, there are no hidden rooms, no trapdoors, nothing out of the ordinary except for the Lute, the Soul Gem, and the book [*Spirit of the Daedra*](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/spirit-daedra). Now, the album has images from inside the book, but I linked the TIL page on it here. It's all a bit fishy, I'll admit, but nothing is necessarily wrong with a house inhabited by a former healer (Rorik's friend, not Rorik) having a soul gem and a book on the Daedra in it.

Let's move to the next house. I checked in [Lemkil's](http://i.imgur.com/2iXeX.jpg) [Farmhouse](http://i.imgur.com/I7qhs.jpg). Nothing out of the ordinary there, though he also has a Lute. There's no Soul Gem I found in his house, but the presence of the Lute in both his and Rorik's houses might suggest there's more to them than meets the eye? Or perhaps I'm reaching. Either way, let's move on again, to the last house in Rorikstead proper.

I checked [Cowflop](http://i.imgur.com/nNzZu.jpg) [Farmhouse](http://i.imgur.com/xifdb.jpg), and found no structural oddities. However, sitting there, staring me in the face, was a Soul Gem. Not even a hidden one, either. That's a bit odd, though by itself could be explained away by the presence of a long-lived elven woman, I suppose. It gets a little more fishy when you add it to the other one in Rorik's Manor, though. I also checked out the [Inn](http://i.imgur.com/A9KUL.jpg), but aside from the [firepit below the ground](http://i.imgur.com/3S1lS.jpg) nothing was amiss.

So, I next left Rorikstead, and started looking for other, outside causes to the oddities of the Soul Gems.

I first checked the nearby [Bleakwind Bastion](http://i.imgur.com/MaVBg.jpg) (at least, I think that's its name), from which you can easily see Rorikstead. The tower was inhabited by [two](http://i.imgur.com/G5ABz.jpg) [Forsworn](http://i.imgur.com/Qg3Pw.jpg), and [*a Hagraven*](http://i.imgur.com/UDrCe.jpg). Inside the tower, there was [a shrine](http://i.imgur.com/UrlTP.jpg), a chest with leveled loot, and [two cairn-like](http://i.imgur.com/3URk5.jpg) [structures](http://i.imgur.com/k2BYA.jpg) covered in blood.

Next, I moved to the nearby Nordic ruin, Moldering Ruin (iirc). With Dawnguard, it's turned into a Master Vampire's lair, and I don't know if it's normally inhabited by vampires or not without Dawnguard. However, you can also [see Rorikstead from it](http://i.imgur.com/3ga6w.jpg). Inside, there was a [Master Vampire](http://i.imgur.com/Bn2Ey.jpg), a [thrall](http://i.imgur.com/VJVIp.jpg), and a chest of leveled loot. There was a Death Hound and two thralls outside, but I neglected to take a picture of them due to a Sabre Cat.

Finally, there was the [burial mound of Nahagliiv](http://i.imgur.com/7NUbu.jpg), which is [literally a few hundred feet from Rorikstead](http://i.imgur.com/YSfa1.jpg).

.

So, with all the investigation out of the way, now it's [Conjecture Time!](/g)

What do you think? Are we making a mountain out of a molehill? Does the presence of a Hagraven a short walk away from Rorikstead have any significance? What about the Vampire Lair? Could there be some sort of influence from Nahagliiv's body on the people of Rorikstead? Could they be trapped in time, existing in 4E 201 but thinking it's sometime in the First Era?

1358357197.0,228,self.teslore,16ozps,An unplanned post about Ulfric Stormcloak,,255,27,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16ozps/an_unplanned_post_about_ulfric_stormcloak/,"This weird and rushed post is my feeble attempt to pool everything we know about Ulfric Stormcloak, and show why I feel he's one of the most realized characters in the entire TES series (below Vehk, of course).

Ulfric had a ten-year period of training with the Greybeards on High Hrothgar. He was actually invited up to the monastery by the Greybeards themselves, and was on the path to becoming one of them when the Great War broke out. He cut his training off early and went down, and some time later abandoned the Way of the Voice.

Ulfric, along with his friends Galmar Stone-Fist and Rikke, fought in the Imperial Legion once news of the War broke in Skyrim. Unfortunately, Ulfric was captured by the Thalmor at some point before they took the Imperial City.

He was subsequently tortured to and past his breaking point by Elenwen, who would later become the Thalmor's top agent in Skyrim, leading and organizing the effort of every Dominion agent in Skyrim, as well as managing the Embassy outside of Solitude.

He's had the worst of it, really. It's bound up mainly in two things: survivors' guilt, and the breaking of his pride, honor, courage, spirit, what have you, in torture. We'll start with the latter.

Ulfric was broken in Thalmor torture. Now, I don't know about you, but no form of torture sounds pleasant. From what we've seen, the Thalmor have the capacity for mercy in the same sense that the Dwemer had that capacity. So, none at all. Their torture is brutal, efficient, and damned effective. Elenwen was the torturer assigned to Ulfric, and she broke him completely. He spilled information about the Imperial City and its defenders. While he gave them information after the City had been taken, he was led to believe that what he said was key in the Dominion's capture. That brings us back to the former: Ulfric now, in addition to feeling that he failed his people by being weak enough to break under torture, is now feeling that every man, woman, and child who died when the Dominion took over the Imperial City, and every soldier who died during the Battle of Red Ring when the City was recaptured, died because of his weakness. Every soldier who died died because of him. His comrades' and friends' blood is on his hands, because he was weak. He's not worth his salt. He's not worthy to be a Tongue, or the son of the great Bear of Eastmarch. He abandoned the Way of the Voice, and failed the Greybeards. He's not worthy to be considered to sit on the Throne of Ysgramor in Ysgramor's Palace in Ysgramor's City. He's not worth calling a Nord. He should be the one lying dead in his own blood, not them.

And to his horror, when he's released, he finds that the Empire gave in to end the bloodletting. The agreed to the same terms they rejected at the start of the war, including banning the worship of the god of Men, the patron of the Empire, and its founder. A Dragonborn among Dragonborn, and a true Nord. He not only failed untold thousands, but now he's failed the entirety of the Empire, and failed its founder and his god. But he's not the only one who failed. Every soldier who fought in the Legion failed. Every single death was utterly pointless. Every drop of blood spilled was a waste. There was no point to any of it.

Ulfric is the lowest of the low in his own estimation. And he returns to Skyrim an utterly broken man. The people of Windhelm are demanding the fight continue, that the Dominion be utterly crushed instead of the blasphemous Concordat accepted. This likely planted the seed that would soon flourish in him. With the Markarth Incident, he felt that he could be useful again, that he could make it up to his god and his people. And so he did. The Jarl of Markarth, so grateful for Ulfric and his troops' aid, opened the Shrine of Talos to them so that they could worship. And then, the Empire betrayed him again in his mind, by letting the Thalmor capture him and his men, and trampling over the word of the Jarl of Markarth. The Empire sets up shop in Markarth, no thanks to Ulfric, and he and his men rot in the Thalmor's prison. While he's in jail, his father dies, and the Throne of Ysgramor grows cold. He can't even be there to bury his father. He's forced to give a eulogy through a smuggled note. Now he enters onto the dark path of rebellion. He's been betrayed by his Empire, who betrayed (in his eyes) the people of Skyrim, and all men because they betrayed Talos. His hurt and self-loathing turn to hatred, to anger, and his rebellion takes hold. He is released, and assumes the Throne of Ysgramor as a different man. He is older, wiser, and angry beyond belief. He and his friend Galmar prepare for revenge, while the Thalmor took root near Solitude. That further enforces his vision of the Empire as a dying and corrupt husk, forced to do the Dominion's bidding. 

Thalmor agents walk Skyrim freely. Khajiit (who Ulfric would have fought against during the War) are travelling through Skyrim with no regard for their laws and customs, and the skooma trade is picking up. The Dunmer his father welcomed into the City of Ysgramor, who his father gave an entire quarter of the city to, are refusing to join the rest of the city, and are trying to recreate Morrowind instead of trying to adjust to Skyrim, like their kin in Riften have. To make it worse, they've been fighting with the Argonians who work the docks, and tensions are high throughout the city. Ulfric doesn't like either of them, and puts the Argonians outside the walls in a dormitory. Meanwhile, he is content to ignore the Dunmer like he feels they ignore Windhelm. His citizens, however, don't like the Dunmer. Some of them hate them with a xenophobic passion only seen in the TES series when it was exhibited by the Dunmer of Vvardenfell to the outlander who would eventually be named Nerevarine. The Nords of Windhelm feel that the Dunmer are dragging their city down, and begin to take matters into their own hands, which Ulfric does not stop. Then a serial killer starts striking. Windhelm is a city of understated chaos.

Then, High King Istlod dies, and the Moot places his son Torygg on the throne. Ulfric uses the Moot as a platform to speak his anger towards the Empire, and urge independence from the entity he feels has betrayed him, Skyrim, and Talos. He's ultimately unsuccesful, but his words win him the heart of the new High King. Soon after, Ulfric traveles to Solitude to meet with Torygg. Torygg respected Ulfric as a war-hero even before he stirred his heart with talk of freedom at the Moot, and so he thought he was there to further discuss Skyrim's independence, a topic Torygg was open to, even if he couldn't officially say he was. By the time he figured out Ulfric meant to challenge him for the throne, there was no way out.

You know the rest. Ulfric Shouted Torygg to the ground and stabbed him, sending his soul to Sovngarde. There, Torygg was lost in a strange mist, and saw Skyrim's doom approaching. Ulfric renounced all claims to be a man of peace, and took on the role of the Tongues of old, calling for others to do the same. He then returned to Windhelm, and the Stormcloak Rebellion was on.

Before I end this, let me give you some of [Ulfric's own words during *Skyrim*](http://pastebin.com/bxW6Y3TB). You *really* should read through it, knowing Ulfric's mind and motivations. Also, I forgot [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAS8y_RzLXY) initially, the video that inspired this entire post to begin forming in my head.

~~Ulfric may be acting rashly, and~~ No one can excuse the death of so many by his hand or word during the events of *Skyrim*, but I honestly think he was doing the only thing he thought he could do. You don't have to agree with him, or like him. But you should at least pity him, a broken man trying to do his best to hold his world together. He's in over his head, but not for the wrong reasons. He's definitely the most realized character in *Skyrim*, and I would rank him among the top four or five for the entire TES series.

1359153792.0,208,self.teslore,17a79q,The Structure and Strength of the Argonian Army,xenoposeidon,250,42,169,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17a79q/the_structure_and_strength_of_the_argonian_army/,"Just how strong is the An-Xileel?

Simply put, very. Very, very powerful.

Lots of people have been repeatedly asking me about all the joking I do about Argonians being vastly superior in military strength to any other province of Empire on Tamriel. Many people find it funny when I make comments such as ""The Argonians could defeat the Aldmeri Dominion!"" They excuse is all for a hearty biased laugh. 

This right here is my attempt to educate many of you on the theoretical yet slightly confirmed superpower that is the An-Xileel.

So, first and foremost:

**Command**

One of the most important part of an army and just what may draw the line between a legion and a raiding party is Strategy and Command. Many people excuse Argonian warfare (and their ways of life, mind you) to be primitive and ignorant. They think that on the split territory between ""Raiding Party"" and ""Legion"" the Argonians would land right down on Raiding Party, that their attacks are wild and uncoordinated. This is as far from true as possible. Argonians don't need to be neither a primitive raiding party or an organized legion, they are high above any of those. 

Who commands a Legion? Why, a Legate, of course. A human or above average intelligence and memorized experience in battle. 

Now who commands the An-Xileel military? The Hist do. A single conjoined mind of thousands of trees, each one able to out think any other mortal individually. The Hist are brilliant, deceptive, and brutal. They are always aware of everything, can immediately send commands to any soldier's mind instantaneously, are always and frantically followed by their soldiers, and communicate with the other commanders at all time. Think of it like the conjoined mind of Alexander the Great, Julius Ceasar, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, and Shi Huangdi times a few hundred. That's something. But definitely not all.


**Communication**

Now here comes probably my favorite part of the An-Xileel military- ultimate communication. Communication between soldiers, generals, scouts, etc. is very important. Without good communication the battle would chaotic and much friendly fire would occur. Supplies would be handed out unevenly, soldiers would fight individually, and basically instead of having an organized fighting force you would have the Tamrielic equivalent of an FPS Team Deathmatch team. 

Now normal Tamrielic armies may have pretty good communication, with networks of couriers and weapon distribution, but Argonians have the most complex and effectively organized communication system imaginable. The Argonian army is not an order or an organization- it is a unified body, with working organs and blood veins making the body live and fight as though it was one object.

We know from Infernal City that no Argonians have any recollections of any actual battles. No memories, no pictures, nothing. And we also don't see any Argonians claiming to be veterans or their ancestors be ones even though basically every Argonian on Nirn was in the An-Xileel military around the start of 4E. Why?

Well, what happens in battle, is that the Argonians are tapped into the Histmind, becoming one mind with the Hist. When all Argonians are one with the Hist, all Argonians are also one mind with each other. They think together, move together, see together, hear together, smell together, and kill together. When they are disconnected from the mind, they simply cannot comprehend it anymore and thus forget their experience. When you have thousands upon thousands of eyes it is a very incomprehensible experience. 

Anyways, what happens then is that all data of battle and all action is accounted and analyzed at the same time. With thousands of eyes scanning different parts of the landscape and every single kill counted, the Hist basically gain the equivalent of an all powerful surveillance system with thousands of cameras and live statistics of everything that happens in battle. They then use their hyper-intelligence to use this data and make any changes to action or alter the Argonians in any way needed to get the battle won. The fact that the Hist see everything also means that every enemy is counted for, and thus as long the Hist want to kill it they will. No one can escape. You know how no Dunmer in any book or any that you meet in game have any memories of the massacre no matter how old they are? Yeah, that's because every single Dunmer in the range of attack was killed. Every single one. No hostages, no escapes, no fleeing. They all die.

Now, by now you are thinking, ""yeah, yeah, Xeno, so the Hist are super advanced and shit, but you haven't even answered your own question! How strong is the actual army! Talk about the soldiers""

Will do happily. You just be patient.

**Soldiers and Fighting Efficiency**

It is very well known and can be recounted from pretty much any source about Argonians that they are the best Guerrilla fighters on Tamriel. Argonians are masters of sneaking, stabbing, neck-breaking, and sneak attacking. This makes the Argonians some of the best close quarters fighters on Tamriel in casual situations.

Note I said casual situations. That is, hunting, duels, pirate attacks, raiding, Banditry, etc. 

The An-Xileel soldier ain't no casual shit.

We know from Infernal City that the Hist altered the Argonians to make them much more battle efficient. For an explanation of how they did so [please take a gander at this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/161yk6/the_elder_way_hist_genetics_and_argonian/). Believe me they weren't kidding. Let's compare your average Joe'zijja to An-Xileelic warrior.

Joe'zijja stands 6 feet tall, can fight relatively well with daggers, sprints at about 15.5 Miles Per Hour, and has the strength a tad bit below your average Imperial human. In hands to hand fighting he would able to easily defeat any common Imperial man, but not for example a Nord or Orc.

The average An-Xileelic warrior has been altered by the Hist to stand at just over 8 feet, and can be calculated to run up to speeds of 29 Miles Per Hour with full gear on. He has the arm strength of a relatively very powerful Orc male, and in hands to hand fighting could most likely punch out an entire tribe of Khajiit.

And that's not all! Mr. Average An-Xileelic Warrior has a Naga buddy from some tribe south of Stormhold. When Naga Buddy charges at the Dunmer city, he can be calaculated to run up to speeds of 33 Miles Per Hour, stand at just over 11""6 feet tall, and has the strength of a young giant. In hand to hand fighting it is quite likely Naga buddy could easily punch a frost troll to death, or perhaps two.

So you see, the An-Xileelic warriors are quite powerful. The Hist make them so, in any case. But at-least armies like the Imperial Legion have better armories than them, right?

No. Definitely not.

**Weaponry**

In 3E433 when the gates of Oblivion opened thousands upon thousands of Argonians charged in, killing every Daedra in their path and looting Dagon's realm so savagely that he had to wait for them to leave and close the gates. A year later *enormous* amounts of all sorts of miscellaneous loot from Dagon's realm was sold by Lilmothi traders and found all over the Imperial Markets, so much we can see in Infernal City.

So, the Argonians killed thousands of soldiers and looted not only a realm of Oblivion but that one owned by the Daedric prince of destruction and killing. Let me say that if they managed to loot a market full of Void Salts, they probably looted from both corpses and the realm some other things that may be favored by Dagon more than void salts, and lots more than they did Void Salts. There is also a reason why this particular loot wasn't also sold to Imperial Markets, because the Argonians wanted it for their army.

So, yes, here's what I'm getting at:

Beyond their altered giant mutant appearence in battle, [this picture may just be how your average An-Xileelic soldier looks as of 4E](http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/my-new-armor-in-skyrim-daedric-armor-micketo-28353120-296-564.jpg). Armed to the brim with all sorts of Daedric daggers, swords, and spears, and protected by heavy plates of Daedric armor only an altered mutant can run and comfortably fight in. 

Weaponry of the An-Xileelic legion is the best on Nirn. So is armor.

Now we know the Argonian soldier is the best and most well equipped. But how many are there?

The Most.

**Size**

The An-Xileelic army is by far and large (hehe) the most sizable army on Tamriel, to the point where ""army"" does it no justice. Swarm is a better term.

We know undoubtedly that Argonians are best at survival and that they have the most children at birth, so we know the Argonian population is quite damn large if they both have many children and all of them survive. And we also know almost **every single Argonian on Tamriel** was called to arms by the Hist at the time of the Oblivion crisis. I'm not gonna give any numbers because I can't, but I will make it decisevly clear that no army can even come *close* to the size of the Argonian army. 

So now we know all about the actual swarm, but what about smaller units? Any cool Spec Ops?

Yup.

**Shadowscales**

We already discussed that there are many, many Argonians. And we also know every single Argonian born under sign of Shadow becomes a super powerful assassin. What a nice equation we have here.

The Shadowscales themselves number anything between 300 - 1000 assassins. Every single one acting and thinking together. Every single one given highest altering priority by the Hist. 

Go ahead, take some time to think of that. Done? Good. Are you convinced yet? I sure am.

---

So let's wrap it all up: 

The Argonian army is the largest, strongest, most efficient fighting force on Nirn. It is united as a single body and driven by frantic devotion. All that stand in its way are massacred by giant-sized Supernagas or assassinated by hiveminded Shadowscales. That is all.

There's a horrible misconception that people just can't seem to shake (either by ignorance or when in denial - seriously, it happens) that MK is no more than a fan, and his contributions to the TES series hold no more sway than fanfiction.

This doesn't come from having the wrong facts as much as it is a matter of misconstrued semantics: Michael Kirkbride is not employed by Bethesda Softworks. This is absolutely true. In fact, he hasn't been since 2000. An employee is someone who is regularly paid to regularly perform a specific set of tasks for their employer. By definition, MK is not an employee for Bethesda Softworks.

However, this fact does not, by default, imply or prove that MK does not work for Bethesda. MK acts as an independent contractor outside of regular employment in other firms. ""Unlike an employee, an independent contractor does not work regularly for an employer but works as and when required"". It's that simple. This is how he has worked with Bethesda, over the course of 13 years, since he ceased to be a full-time employee.

These contracts can be small, such as writing books or dialogue, or they can be large, such as writing *Knights of the Nine*. Here's a list of examples of MK's visible recent contributions to TES games (non-exhaustive):

***Oblivion***:

* MK wrote much dialogue, including all of Mankar Camoran's.

* He wrote the *Knights of the Nine* DLC.

* He wrote many in-game books for *Oblivion*, including (but not limited to) Mankar Camoran's Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes.

* He was even credited as part of the development team as an additional writer (one of two, alongside Tedders).

***Skyrim***:

* Heimskr in Whiterun recites lines of *""From the Many-Headed Talos""*, an out-of-game text by MK.

* The White-Gold Concordat was MK's idea.

* After *Skyrim*'s announcement, MK began to post Skyrim/Nord-related texts on the forums. These texts foreshadowed concepts included in *Skyrim* (either MK knew they were a part of the game thus proving his direct involvement in the development process, or Bethesda placed elements of the texts into the game after the texts were written thus proving they value his artistic influence):

 * The concept of painted cows was included, introduced by MK's out-of-game text *""The Seven Fights of the Aldudagga: Fight Six, ""The 911th Cow""""*.

 * The Companions are included in *Skyrim* as a playable faction. The Companions' hall, Jorrvaskr, is made from the hull of Ysgramor's boat. This is a reference to MK's out-of-game text *""The Five Hundred Mighty Companions or Thereabouts of Ysgramor the Returned""*. The in-game book *""Songs of the Return""* (not written by MK) includes lore validating that text also.

* The in-game book *""The Book of the Dragonborn""* (not written by MK) explicitly references the Towers - and them going down one by one - which is a concept introduced by MK in his out-of-game text *""Nu-Mantia Intercept""*.

I'll make it clear: I am *not* telling people that MK's work needs to be accepted as canon by anyone, because that's up to you.

",Vaelkyri,193,19,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/yl1dz/bloody_blackreach_the_truth_behind_the_fall_of/,"**Bloody Blackreach:  The Truth Behind The Fall of the Falmer.**

**Of Ancient Magicks, Power Immeasurable and Deeds most Foul.**

-A consolidated theory on the fall of the Falmer race using recently surfaced  information, notably the research of Prof Katria (posthumously awarded) and her cohort, information that has surfaced during the recent Vampire Crisis, The Aetherium Wars by Taron Dreth and the always invaluable The Falmer: A study by Ursa Uthrax.

Complied by scholars of the Imperial University, led by Vaelkyr Vicir -   4E 201. 


Long have the enigmatic races of Dwemer and Falmer both fascinated and confused Imperial Historians. The total and sudden disappearance of the Dwemer, leaving nothing behind but their strange (and often deadly) machines has made research difficult. Coupled with the fact that almost no written records have survived, and those that have are an extensive challenge to decipher and translate has left us very much in the dark about these strange ‘deep elves’.

Ironically, it has been revelations about an even less understood race, thought pure fantasy until recent times, - the Falmer or  ‘snow elves’ that has shined a light on the Dwemer and exposed some very dark and very ugly truths about this advanced and powerful race.

Firstly some background, whilst we will not address the bloody massacre at Sarthaal during the “Night of Tears”, nor the reasoning’s behind that- we will let our esteemed colleagues deal with that little mystery- It is important to note it as the beginning of the end for the Falmer Civilisation. Ysgrammor survived Sarthaal and returned with his 500 Companions to drive the elves from Skyrim.  As told in Lokheims “Fall of the Snow Prince” they succeeded, shattering the Falmer and driving the few that remained by that time into hiding.

The Falmer were thought lost to time, either exterminated in the war or simply faded away for countless centuries, until the esteemed Ursa Uthrax uncovered a much darker fate which he published in The Falmer: A Study, currently the most extensive work of knowledge on the Falmer race. 

They did not die, though I’m sure many wished they had. Ursa discovered that the remaining Falmer had fled into the great underground caverns of Blackreach, seeking shelter with their cousins the Dwemer or ‘deep elves’. The Dwemer did grant that protection, but at a horrible cost- the Falmer were fed poisoned mushrooms that grow in Blackreach which eventually drove them blind, not just the first generation, but every generation after that, until the Falmer lost all sight to the darkness. The Dwemer were cruel taskmasters, using the crippled Falmer as slaves until an eventual and inevitable rebellion known as the ‘War of the Crag’.

There is no doubt in this scholars mind that during this time Blackreach served as a prison, laboratory,  and work camp all rolled into one. The convenience it offered the Dwemer with a slave workforce accessible at any part of the empire, its secure location, easy availability of the poisoned mushrooms that enforced their hold on the Falmer , and its close proximity to the mines (which will be addressed in a later section) would have turned the dark beauty of Blackreach into a den of pain and horror for the survivors of the Falmer race.

But there is another side to this story, the Dwemer.
 
Recent discoveries by the late Prof Katria (posthumously decorated) and the scholar Taron Dreth, have uncovered a great deal of information about the Dwemer Empire in Skyrim at this point in history. Katria’s research points to a loose confederation of Dwemer states, Arkngthamz, Bthar-zel ( though this may be an outpost of the larger nearby Bthardamz), Raldbthar and Mzulft, working on a joint project at Bthalft. It appears that such alliances to work towards large technological advances were not uncommon, however it also appears that this alliance did not last. What the Dwemer discovered was so powerful they went to war with each other all seeking to wrest the ultimate power for themselves.

What as this power? Aetherium, a rare and power substance that could be used to created immensely powerful magical artifacts. This scholar has personally laid eyes upon one such artifact, forged with the last remaining Aetherium by a cohort of the late Prof Katria, a gleaming crown inset with Glowing milky blue orbs that shine from some vast internal power.

By now I’m sure you as the reader are wondering, what does all this talk of Falmer, Dwemer and Aetherium have to do with each other?

Everything.

The Aetherium was mined deep within the Blackreach, at the same time as it was being used as a slave camp for Falmer. It is only logical to conclude that Falmer slaves would have been used to mine what was reportedly a ‘harmonically volatile substance’.  Dwemer technology, whislt impressive, would have been little surprise to the magically powerful Falmer, hardly a prize worth going to extreme measures to protect. But Aetherium? A substance so precious and powerful the Dwemer would wage war upon themselves for its control? Now that is something to murder for.

It is this scholar’s assertion that the Falmer were blinded to protect not secrets of Dwemer technology as is commonly believed, *but that they were blinded for the sole purpose of concealing the secret of Aetherium!* That the Falmer, kept penned as slaves within the Blackreach were used to mine the potentially dangerous material from the deep caves and that the Dwemer systematically poisoned the entire Falmer race, perhaps even with the intent of total genocide, to protect their powerful discovery. Some of my associates have even speculated the rather morbid possibility that, with Blackreach being rich in raw soul gems, and Dwemer  animunculi requiring charged soul gems to operate, the Falmer could have served as...  dare I say it a sacrificial power source.

The sad remnants of the Falmer were only saved by civil war within the Dwemer alliance, granting them the chance to break free and stage a rebellion, the ‘War of the Crag’. A war which raged through the dark underneath until the day the Dwemer simply vanished.

A grim tale indeed, but there is one more thing that must be considered, the Falmer were used as slaves within the deep mines to gather raw Aetherium,  -  during the Dwemer civil war, and subsequent Falmer rebellion they fled “into the deeper caves”, denying Dwemer entry.  *It is possible that deep within the Blackreach raw untouched Aetherium may still be found!*
 
A stretch to be sure, but this scholar feels an expedition to search for any possible remaining Aetherium deposits is worth the not insubstantial risks and should be conducted with utmost haste.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Addendum: Discussions with the honoured Quintus Umbranox, Researcher at the Synod reguarding timelines seem to reinforce this theory. With the Aetherium Wars beginning circa 1e 222-225 (around the death of High King Harald) with the creation of the Aetherium Forge, and the sudden collapse of the Dwemer Empire in Skyrim before High King Gellir's forces several decades later it is likely that the extended Civil war coupled with the Falmer 'breakout' contributed heavily to the unexpected Nord Victory. This would place the beggining in of the War of the Crag circa 1e 250- 260.

That the Dwemer never experimented with Aetherium again in the ~450years till thier disappearance and the chances of Dwemer walking away from a power source willingly are zero to none indicates that there was likely an external force preventing them form accessing the raw Aetherium. In this case the Falmer 'rebels. As Quintus Umbranox also pointed out, a 450 year underground war would also explain the Falmers change form relative peace to insane savagery, and the reason the Dwemer in Skyrim were significantly behind technologicaly speaking compared to thier Vvardenfell compatriots.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1356146124.0,,,True,t3_yl1dz,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/yl1dz/bloody_blackreach_the_truth_behind_the_fall_of/,
1362919603.0,165,self.teslore,1a0sao,"""Khajiit did not steal anything!"". A look into why Khajiit theft is misunderstood.",Mr_Flippers,194,29,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1a0sao/khajiit_did_not_steal_anything_a_look_into_why/,"I'm writing this after ginja_ninja's... remarks about Khajiit stealing (wubwubwubwub). It's really unrelated but it brought back the reminder that Khajiit are very misunderstood by both players, scholars and Tamrielic citizens alike with their foreign ways. So of course, I'm going to be talking about stealing.

First, you have to understand the way Khajiit think about it. I picked up on a great example by IIRC Rial91 who knows his fair share of Khajiiti lore, and that is an example of a shopkeeper and his assistant, I cant think of names so bugger it I'm going to use their titles.

Shopkeeper wants assistant to move some things around upstairs, Assistant goes upstairs to move the stock. Assistant looks over onto a crate and sees a fish. The fish is just laying there still as most dead fish do. Assistant decides he's hungry so he eats the fish. Assistant finishes his job and continues working. Shopkeeper goes upstairs and finds that his fish has been eaten and obviously by Assistant. Shopkeeper calls authorities onto Assistant and he is arrested, Assistant has no idea why.

To the Assistant, he went upstairs to do his job, he saw a food item. The fish wasn't labeled with ""Shopkeepers' fish"", it didn't tell him ""you there, I'm the Shopkeepers fish!"". It was just there and on a crate in a place they both work in. Who owns every fish in the world? no one. The fish was, as far as Assistant could tell, belonging to no one. If it didn't belong to anyone, it was Assistant's for the taking. Then he gets taken by authorities for having his lunch! Ridiculous.

You could say that Khajiit think in regards to property that if there's nothing clearly stating what something belongs to, they have a ""finder's keepers"" type of thinking.

Another example, Khajiit goes into a house. No one lives in this house. Khajiit decides to stay. After a few days, another Khajiit comes into the house; Khajiit does not care, there is plenty of room in the house to share. More come into the house; Khajiit still enjoys his time staying in his part of the house. the house becomes really crowded, so Khajiit decides to leave because he was no longer enjoying the house, he will find another place to rest. It may not be *his* place, but it will be *a* place.

So, this should've given you an idea of how the Khajiit generally act regarding property. Now onto the perception of ""thievery"" and how it's different.

To most on Tamriel, thievery is a filthy act, taking the hard-earned goods of someone by someone who has no respect for their property and likely other people. It's looked down upon by many. Khajiit also think of the selfish poorly, but a thief may not be a thief.

Observing the well known word/prefix ""Dar"". It means many things, not just ""thief"". Dar can have the following meanings: thief, clever, ""to kill"" (rarely used) and a person who's skilled with their hands (which can be a blacksmith, carpenter, what have you). One who is termed ""dar"" or given the prefix ""dar"" is a clever person and rather talented, a useless person doesn't get the honour of a prefix. Why is a thief clever? simple, they had to have the cunning and smarts to properly take from Khajiit. This is not like a person walking into the house and ""taking"" one floor of the house from the example Khajiit, Khajiit know their possessions and to have taken them undetected is a great skill.

Let's look at the supposed god Rajhin, he was as ""dar"" as they came. We've all heard the story, Rajhin stole a tattoo off of Empress Kintyra's neck. This involves both cleverness and thievery. Cleverness in his understanding of stealth and talents for being so sneaky and successful. Thievery for the fact he had taken an item for himself that was clearly belonging to another. On the topic of Rajhin, personally I'd say he's more a saint than a god and was ""deified"" to be an example of cleverness (which is something that Khajiit respect greatly, it's integral in their nature and whoever can do it better than any other is obviously going to be liked).

Now, this does not mean that thievery is looked upon like ""wow, you stole x, y, z from Eg'Example"", in fact, it's seen as a filthy act of a lowlife. Most Khajiit belong to something, whether it be a clan, town, caravan or kingdom, they use their talents to benefit what they are a part of. Thieves who act selfishly and for themselves are degenerates for they don't act to benefit something else. But, if one steals from let's say a wealthy person from another kingdom, they will have greatly aided their clan/kingdom with the newly brought riches.

This isn't to say there aren't proper thieves amongst Khajiit, but you have to understand what it is they're doing and why they're doing it. If you're just some traveler walking around Elsweyr and a Khajiit steals your bag, they were probably some lowlife scum that's only liked by other lowlives. In fact, if they just ran up and took your bag, they probably won't live long if they're that stupid amongst a race known for having one thought, one expression and one sentence all different from each other.

Now you'll probably ask ""but so many Khajiit in games I play *are* thieves/criminals, they can't all be misunderstood"". That's correct, they aren't all misunderstood. It's commonly agreed upon (but not exactly established ""canon"") that the Khajiit who are outside of Elsweyr (where you play) are outside of Elsweyr for a good reason. There aren't many Khajiit outside of Elsweyr because they'd like to see more of the world or expand riches in some other land to travel, but they do exist. Most aren't decent folk; Ri'saad in Skyrim, when asked about his homeland, eventually stops and says ""Ri'saad will talk no more, for he misses his home"" or something along those lines. Just using him as an example, there's a few reasons as to why he isn't there, either A: He's no longer welcome after whatever criminal activity he may have participated in or B: he is VERY faithful and is following the moonpath that leads him throughout Skyrim. That last one may be a possibility for Ri'Saad and other caravaners, but it doesn't really work for many other outside Khajiit. I wouldn't be surprised if many who work for those lead caravaners work took it on because they couldn't find another type of work/lifestyle they're accustomed to in Elsweyr that wasn't thievery (in the well known sense).

I believe I've covered all, if not most, areas regarding Khajiit and ""thievery"". If you have any further questions feel free to ask. Hopefully now you can look upon your furry neighbours with understanding (although don't trust all of them, some can be real scumbags).",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1362920057.0,,Moth,True,t3_1a0sao,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1a0sao/khajiit_did_not_steal_anything_a_look_into_why/,
1354433228.0,159,self.teslore,1455tg,The Form of the Atronachs,Ishullanu,182,23,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1455tg/the_form_of_the_atronachs/," As commonly known, Atronachs are a form of Daedra who are physical manifestations of their particular element, the most prevalent examples being frost, flame, and storm. They are favored by conjurers as they seem less ambitious or malevolent as other daedra, and with no individual loyalties to a Daedric Prince they are overall easier to control. An interesting phenomena is the various reported outward appearances of these elemental atronachs, which seem to change based on the province they are summoned into. Considering that these atronachs are essentially just elemental powers given manifestations, it is unlikely that they have a set preference on how they wish their summoned form to appear, as long as they are true to their nature aesthetics wouldn't be a concern. I posit what shape and characteristics an atronach takes on is determined by the predominant cultural view of  that atronach’s element. Put simply, an atronach appears to look like whatever the local people feel it should look like. This relationship is most clear when comparing flame or frost atronachs, particularly with Tamrelic provinces with radically different climates. 

First let us examine the [Flame Atronach’s appearance in Morrowind](http://i.imgur.com/kn4UU.jpg). Here we see a clearly masculine figure, aggressive in its stance and demeanor. This flame atronach has sharp features, the blocky spiked armor creates a definite aura of immediate danger. His movements are deliberate and forceful, moving across the ashlands with a confident sense of belonging. All of these qualities mirror how the Dunmeri people view the element of flame, especially those who lived on the island of Vvardenfell. Those who lived in the shadow of Red Mountain knew that fire could be an hostile and persistent force. Groups who traveled across Vvardenfell consistently braved intense heat and open lava, in addition to the ever-present threat of full eruption. Even though the Dunmer had grown accustomed to fire, it was not seen as a comfort but as a threat. 

These feeling on the nature of fire contrast sharply with the views of the Nord’s in Skyrim, and non-coincidentally so too does the [manifestation of the Flame Atronach.] (http://i.imgur.com/qTbUe.jpg) An obvious difference in the Skyrim variant is its gendered characteristics, distinct feminine features are undeniably present. Not seen here is much of the bulky straightforwardness of Vvardenfell atronach, armor is sparse, creating not much more than a silhouette. Some horns are present, but nothing directly threatening. The appearance brings with it a change in presence, Skyrim’s flame atronachs move with a distinct grace, literally floating over the terrain. As inappropriate as it may sound, the Skyrim atronach’s movements suggest an intentional allure, with flips and twirls that serve no non-aesthetic purpose. This perfectly reflects the Nord’s covetous relationship with fire, in the coldest land in Tamerial in is understandable that warmth is a desirable thing. The atronachs flighty and quick movements over the ground could be representing the fleeting nature of heat in the frozen wastelands.  So here, in contrast to the harsh and fierce eastern flame atronachs, Nord culture produces an atronach that while still clearly dangerous shows the seductive comfort inherent in the element it represents. 

Interestingly enough the [flame atronachs seen in Cyrodiil] (http://i.imgur.com/oQpYN.jpg) seem to be a blend of aspects of Skyrim’s and Morrowind’s atronachs. While still female in appearance, the Cyrodilic flame atronach is missing much of the elegance found in the Skyrim variant. This can easily be explained by Cyrodiil’s temperate climate, the Imperial’s know not the adversarial relationship with fire brought by proximity to Red Mountain, nor the deep necessity for fire felt in the colder provinces.

Moving on to frost atronachs, with these creatures the cultural divergences are even more apparent. The [Morrowind frost atronach] (http://i.imgur.com/Ke66F.jpg) while quite intimidating, does not denote a culture possessing profound familiarity with the element of ice. Other than the few icicle spikes and the vapor aura, there is little that represents this atronach’s element. In Vvardenfell there are not many places one would encounter natural ice, and would more likely come across it as an offensive weapon of some monster or man. So the ice atronach reinforces that link, portraying itself as little more than a warrior of ice.

[Skyrim’s frost atronach] (http://i.imgur.com/NoyVM.jpg) is a sentient mountain of ice. There is almost no characterization of the ice, because it is not necessary. The nord’s have understanding of cold, they spend their whole lives fighting against its ravages, this intimacy produces a form that is little more than an animation of what already exists. 

Again, Cyrodiil experiences a [balance between the two extremes] (http://i.imgur.com/6ZQZ7.jpg), having more experience with ice than Morrowind the atronachs incorporate appropriate shapes, but Imperials lack the total acceptance of the cold that allows the the Nord’s to see frost atronachs without humanization.

If this theory of societal belief and interpretation effecting an atronach’s physical forms is correct, then it would be an interesting barometer used to determine a culture’s relationship with their environment. For example, would the Bosmer of  the heavily forested Valenwood create flame atronachs that echo the vulnerability they might have with fire? Could the Red Year of warped the Vvardenfell flame atronach into an even more ferocious creature for the Dunmer, or would their exodus to Solstheim move their collective view of flame closer to the longing of the Nords? And one final supposition, could an individual’s emotions towards an element be powerful enough to overwhelm the views of their people, and summon forth an atronach that assumes a form representing what this element means to specifically that individual?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1355822612.0,,Winterhold,True,t3_1455tg,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1455tg/the_form_of_the_atronachs/,

In this thread I hope to finally put the debate about the comparative size of Tamriel to rest. I also finally got to work on Photoshop a little and finally make some visuals to show just how tiny Tamriel really is.

**Introduction**

The size of Tamriel has been a subject of some heated debate over the last year. Some tried to determine Tamriel's size using game-distances, though this was easily shot down by most lore scholars due to the fact it is known that Bethesda shrunk the provinces quite a bit in order to make them playable. Once this got out of the way, multiple people have attempted to find a correct-to-lore approach to determine the size of Tamriel. These came down to two conflicting scales, both of which were posted here in the subreddit. These two are (named elegantly by myself):

[**The ICCL Scale**](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/sd5o6/the_size_of_tamriel/)

The ICCL scale, i.e the Infernal City Coast to Lilmoth Scale, uses the fact that it is mentioned in the book *The Infernal City* that the Black Marsh city of Lilmoth is approximately 12 miles away from the Black Marsh shoreline. Using this distance, I came up with Tamriel being around the size of Egypt. While this was a very exciting thread, and I myself felt very proud of myself, a better scale came along,

[**The PGEMRM Scale**](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/ui64h/tamriels_size_in_square_miles/)

The PGEMRM scale, which stands for The Pocket Guide to the Empire Mournhold to Red Mountain Scale, provides a much less abstract and more lore-correct way of measuring the size of Tamriel. It uses an in-game book as a source to say the distance from the Morrowind city of Mournhold to the Red Mountain in Vvardenfell. This scale is larger and much more easy to use, as well as is probably more accurate due to the fact that maps of the Lilmoth area are always differing due to the entire region sinking into the sea at times. 

Using the PGEMRM scale I was able to come up with a few visuals to show the true size of Tamriel. 

**Gallery**

I'm sorry about the quality and placement of these. Saying I'm good with Photoshop is like saying a common Dunmer is good at surviving the invasion of the An-Xileeli horde, so you can be assured these are not exactly the most visually appealing. Nevertheless, I believe they make the point.

Hopefully this puts the long debate to rest. If one of you guys wants to take a stab at making better visuals than me I'd be very pleased, though I would require you do so using only Gall-Peters or other kinds of Equal Area projection maps for real world landmasses, and only use maps that are approved in the Imperial Library such as the one I used for showing Tamriel.

Thank you all for taking a gander at that, hopefully y'all can link back to this thread if the question is ever asked again.

I posted this on another part of reddit related to Skyrim and was suggested that I repost my findings here.

I have spent quite a bit of time on translating the second page of the Oghma infinium and at last I was able to translate it!!!
So the issues with the second page were the following, as most of us who have tried have realized:

1) The page is written in a spiral text starting from the upper left and continuing to the lower left. The solution was to break the page down into each line horizontally so it was easier to read. The link to the image is provided below:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/92428355@N08/8392725985/in/photostream

2) Not all the letters can be seen due to it being washed out. By using a photo editor your can adjust the contrast, brightness, and the Mid Tones to bring the letters into focus.

3) Portuguese! Yup that is what it translates into and google translate is your friend but it does take some slight altering of order since we do not have a guide for punctuation.
Now for the Translation!!!

Line 1:

Portuguese: O de historia de Nirn foi vasto e profundo a u ir de Winterhold magia mente fala ele

English: The history of the Nirn was vast and deep go au Winterhold magic of mind he speaks

Line 2::

Portuguese: comandos do Dwemer esperando encontrar a um erro mais conhecimento mais segredo ele

English: commands Dwemer hoping to find a mistake more knowledge more secret he

Line 3:

Portuguese: ora durante as poucas decadas passadas e te nas suas investigaes le consequentemente

English: prays during the past few decades and you read in their investigations accordingly

Line 4:

Portuguese: de afec mais o discernimento consente senhor Daedric no mundo assassinato aqui uma

English: affected most of the Daedric lord consent judgment in the world killing one here

Line 5:

Portuguese: si camas da Skyrim Septimus e ice doenca curas a Dwemer aqui veste o veste o eu a na dano sal case on

English: Skyrim Septimus himself beds and ice cures the disease Dwemer here wearing the clothes I damage the case on salt

Line 6:

Portuguese: um Dunsmir lockbox congelado no gelo.

English: one Dunsmir lockbox frozen in ice.

There it is took me quite a bit of time to translate the page. Now, if people are interested we need to understand the symbolism of the pages and if there is anything else we need to find.

Thank you for reading and happy hunting.

I might add more later, but I feel as though this does for now.

I was always taught to start essays with a good attention getter, so I'll do the best I can with this to scare you. An Elder Scrolls fan asks through the TESO twitter page if there will be an explanation on why Cyrodiil isn't a jungle, of course we already know the answer, if only vaguely, to be related to Tiber Septim's ascension to godhood. There's a lot of ways you can explain it to a fan who doesn't understand a lot about the lore, saying that Talos watches over the men races of Cyrodiil and provided fertile land for the farmers of Cyrodiil. But the official channels don't say that. We've all accepted the answer we've been given for the lack of the endless jungle, but now the developers have rejected that, and replaced it with one of the scariest answers I could imagine.

&gt;[#ESO's Cyrodiil is based on current Tamriel lore. The original ""endless jungle"" description is considered a transcription error.](https://twitter.com/TESOnline/status/265849694708719616)

So there you have it. The jungle description was just a transcription error that spread from [all of the Morrowind Savants,](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/savants-notes-vvardenfell) [The Many Headed Talos](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/many-headed-talos), [A Pocket Guide to the Empire, editions 1 and 2](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-and-its-environs-first-edition), and [The Mythic Dawn Commentaries.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Mythic_Dawn_Commentaries)

What does this mean? What precedent does this set? To me, it seems like the lore is clay, ripe for the shaping by the developers of TESO. Nothing is sacred anymore, an MMO needs to make its money back.

So where else have they strayed from what has become to be accepted? In the meat section here, I'll rapid fire some eye-raising tidbits I've collected, mostly from the Ask Us Anything posts they make on the TESO website, but some come from other sources. If you don't see a source, it's from the Ask Anything posts on the TESO website. A couple things to keep in mind first:

* We all know how ridiculous the factions and the plot are, I am not going to talk about that for the most part.

* I personally am not planning on touching this game at all, keep in mind that this is intended to be *critical* not a fair preview. I'm sure there will be some redeeming qualities of the game.

-Specifically related to the Aldmeri Dominion

This is a big nitpicky one, but I still think this point is relavent. The question was:

&gt;Some people are worried that your interpretation/version of the Aldmeri Dominion isn't as extreme as they were described in the ""Pocket Guide to the Empire."" 

The response:

&gt;Yes – and remember, the “Pocket Guide to the Empire” was written by enemies of the Dominion – every Elder Scrolls lore book reflects the point of view of its author(s), even the PGE. The Aldmeri think their cause is just and actions taken in its name are righteous. Their opponents, on the other hand, regard them as racist authoritarians out to return the humans of Tamriel to a condition little better than slavery.

I can accept the answer, but the more I look at it, the less it works for me. [The Aldmeri Dominon is even described that poorly in the PGE.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-aldmeri-dominion) There are some things in the text that reflects poorly on the Dominion, but every empire needs their flaws. This makes me fear for any concept of depth in the factions at all. Will all the storylines be the same with different characters and places, much like Skyrim's conflict? Only time will tell. I do reject the claims of bias and defamation towards the Imperial Geographic Society. Reading the descriptions of the city makes it seem a magnificent and utopian, which brings me to another question and answer.

&gt;The buildings of Alinor are said to look like they are ""made from glass or insect wings."" If the Summerset Isles are traversable at release will we see a design reminiscent of this? And will we see the Crystal Tower for that matter?! 

&gt;When The Elder Scrolls Online launches, the playable part of the Summerset Isles will be Auridon, the big island between Summerset and the continent that includes the cities of Firsthold and Skywatch. The architecture of the High Elves is fanciful, certainly, but it’s also practical, constructed of real-world materials. Architects can’t make buildings out of poetry!

While it's true that the descriptions in PGE are rather fanciful, it seems to me the developers are taking it too far in the opposite direction. Think back to Vvardenfell. We had wizards who grew their buildings from plants and people who live in a giant crabshell. Some glass and flowing lines isn't necessarily that far out of the norm. Perhaps TESO aims to have the Isles be the ""normal"" place that everyone can start at and not feel scared. I'm done with the points I feel reqire explaining, so here's a few standalone ones.

&gt;Q. There hasn't been a ton of content in Valenwood in the past. How exciting is it for the people working on places in Tamriel that have not been prominently featured in the past? - By Chris McNamara

&gt;A. We know from existing lore that Valenwood is an exaggeration of our own world’s jungles and deep forests. Combine that with a bit of the look seen in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, and we take it from there.

&gt;Q. How do you intend to portray the cannibalism of the Bosmer? 

&gt;A. For the Wood Elves, cannibalism is a matter of ritual significance, and typically quite private within a family or tight-knit group. 

(read as: we don't plan to)

&gt;Q. Most of the uses of moon-sugar are benign, and just satisfy the Catfolk’s insatiable craving for sweets. 

&gt;The Altmer, the Bosmer and the Khajiit share the common traits of intelligence, patience and reason - The High Elf Leader of the Dominion [page on A.D.](http://elderscrollsonline.com/en/game-guide/alliances/aldmeri-dominion)

-Specifically related to the Daggerfall Covenant

So far, this one is known the least about. There hasn't been the Ask Anything released about it yet, and no game has taken place even close to here. The big thing I can find is that [it's pretty weird to have Orcs in Daggerfall](http://elderscrollsonline.com/en/media/wallpapers/453)

-Specifically related to the Ebonheart Pact

The ""uneasy"" alliance. What a surprise that some of the background sits a little uneasy with me. By this point, there has been some significant wisening up by the devs after the disasterous Aldmeri Ask Anything, so they seem to take a more guarded approach.

&gt;Q. Where is the main base of Ebonheart Pact? In which city will we find Jorunn the Skald-King?

&gt;A. The throne of Eastern Skyrim is in Windhelm, but the great city of Mournhold is the capital of the Ebonheart Pact, and it is there that Jorunn presides over the Great Moot.

I said I wouldn't complain about the races too much, and I'll hold to that, but I still don't think that the Dunmer would let the Great Moot be in Mournhold. 

In conclusion, it's okay to be scared. I didn't include every tidbit that's just a cop out or poor gameplay implementation. There is one closing point I'll point out. It's always cool when gameplay merges seamlessly with lore. There's some really cool examples of this in the Elder Scrolls series, like many of the Daedric Quests. Of course there are some poor ones, like the civil war conflict in Skyrim, none I can think of this gross implementation of Elder Scrolls.

&gt;Elder Scrolls are artifacts of immense power that aid an alliance in the ongoing battle to control Tamriel by conferring bonuses to every member of that alliance. Each alliance has a special stronghold in Cyrodiil where their Elder Scrolls are kept and protected – but enemy alliances can break in and take them if they are not guarded properly. Once access is gained and a Scroll taken, it must be taken back across Cyrodiil and placed in the alliance’s stronghold. Only then are the bonuses of the Scroll bestowed upon all the members of that alliance.

That's right. Elder Scrolls are no longer mystical artifacts that tell the very fabric of creation, no, now they take their true purpose: a flag that when captured gives you +5% crit chance.

1365793025.0,123,self.teslore,1c81vg,"It's time to put this puppy to bed. Does the Dovahkiin have Dragon Blood, or a Dragon's soul?",,151,28,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1c81vg/its_time_to_put_this_puppy_to_bed_does_the/,"I'm pretty sure most of us have run into this apparent problem when talking about Dragonborn. Up until the expansion for *Skyrim* of the same name, Alessia was the first known Dragonborn. She was named such on her deathbed, and never demonstrated any Shouts or soul-eating. Her status as Dragonborn was assumed because we have Akatosh giving her a promise to shield Tamriel from Oblivion via Chim-el Adabal, which is a whole different can of worms I will touch on as sparingly as I can. But the key thing about it is that the Amulet is supposed to contain both the souls (or oversoul) of the dead emperors who had this ""shared blood"", making it a giant soul gem, and the Blood of Akatosh himself. Tuck this away for a while.

I had originally meant to do this via screenshots, but Oliver1706 posted a [text dump](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1c63ba/by_request_all_dialogue_in_skyrim/) of all the dialogue in vanilla *Skyrim*, so I scrapped that idea for a far easier one. I went through the document Ctrl + F'ing my way through, looking at each and every instance the words ""blood"" and ""soul"" come up. Spoiler: it's a *lot*.

Then, as I sorted through, I scanned for anything relating to the player character in Skyrim, the last Dragonborn. I'll now paste the exact quotes of dialogue that says the Dragonborn has dragon blood, and who said it:

* The Dragonborn is an exception to all the rules - the Dragon Blood itself is a gift of the gods. If we accept one gift, how can we deny the other? As Dragonborn, you have received the ability to Shout directly from Akatosh. We therefore seek to guide you on the proper use of your gift, which transcends the restrictions which bind other mortals. (Arngeir)

* That is commendable. But remember, the Dragonb Blood is istself a gift of Akatosh. Do not try to deny that gift. (Arngeir)

* Those born with the Dragon Blood in 'em. Like old Tiber Septim himself. (Nord Guard)

* The Akaviri blood seal can only be opened with the right kind of blood. Your blood, Dragonborn. (Esbern)

* So... you spoke to Paarthurnax. The dragonblood burns bright within you. (Arngeir)

* When you Shout, you speak in the language of dragons. Thus, your Dragon Blood gives you an inborn ability to learn Words of Power. (Arngeir)

* But for you, the dragon speech is in your blood, and you learn it almost without effort. (Arngeir)

* We are here to guide you in that pursuit, just as the Greybeards have sought to guide those of the Dragon Blood that came before you. (Arngeir)

* You are not the first. There have been many of the Dragon Blood since Akatosh first bestowed that gift upon mortalkind. (Arngeir)

* Aaah... yes! Sossedov los mul. The dragonblood runs strong in you. It is long since I had the pleasure of speech with one of my own kind. (Note: Sossedov is literally blood of the dragon) (Paarthurnax)

* Ah! It's been too long since last I faced a doom-driven hero of the dragon blood. (Tsun)

* Trust your instincts, Dovahkiin. Your blood will show you the way. (Paarthurnax)

* So. You have made your way here, to me. No easy taks for a joor... mortal. Even for one of Dovah Sos. Dragonblood. (Paarthurnax)

* Dov wahlaan fah rel. We were made to dominate. The will to power is in our blood. You feel it in yourself, do you not? (Paarthurnax)

* It means you have the Dragon Blood - you have an inborn ability to use your Voice the way dragons do. (either Ulfric or Rikke)

* Ah... here's the blood seal. Another of the lost Akaviri arts. No doubt triggered by... well, blood (Esbern)

* Esbern's probably right. Try using your blood on the carved seal on the floor. (Delphine)

Now, with all those examples firmly in the Dragonborn has dragon blood camp, I'll paste the exact quotes of dialogue that says the Dragonborn has a dragon's soul, and who said it:

*     [metapad: Search string not found]

In fact, sifting past all the turns of phrase talking about souls, dialogue from random vampires, and combat lines, there are around twenty lines speaking about the Dovahkiin's soul in vanilla *Skyrim*, three of which I've pulled for this post, and **all** of which are found in the Daedric quest The Black Star.

* Mayln's enchantments are broken. Hold on. I'm going to pull your soul out of there. Brace yourself. (Nelacar)

* I could soul trap you. Place you inside the Star. Then bring you back once Malyn has been dealt with. (Nelacar)

* But be careful. If you die inside the Star, your soul will be disrupted. THere's nothing anyone can do for you if that happens. (Nelacar)

Nelacar is a Altmer mage who uses a special type of soul trap spell on you to send you into the broken Azura's Star that works while you're still living. He takes hold of your soul, tethers it to himself, and sends it in completely. Your entire soul, sans the tether, is out of your body at this point, and is Nelacar's plaything, essentially. And let's not forget that Zurin soul traps Wulfharth by the *Arcturian Heresy*.

Consider dragons. In-game, you the player cannot ever do three  (more like five, but these three are important) things to a dragon with magic: you cannot paralyze a dragon, you cannot revive a dragon, and you cannot soul trap a dragon. The spells simply do not work, regardless of your level, perks, or race. The only one who can revive dragons that we've seen is Alduin, by means of a special Shout, and the only ones who can even effect a dragon's soul are Dragonborn. The only thing a Dragonborn can do to a dragon's soul is devour it. That's the whole special significance of being Dragonborn, because no other mortal can even touch a dragon's soul.

Compare the sources. Nord folklore, the Greybeards, the Blades, an actual dragon (the brother of Alduin himself, second-oldest of the dragons) and a *god* all say that the Dragonborn (and all Dragonborn throughout history, by association) have dragon blood in their veins. No one in-game says that the Dragonborn has a dragon's soul. No book says it, no rumors say it, no gameplay even suggests it (and yes, we'll get to Miraak). In *Oblivion*'s lore, the Dragon Blood was a prerequisite to being able to wear Chim-el Adabal, and thus be counted as a legitimate Dragonborn Emperor.

The most overwhelming thing is this: when the Dragonborn travels to Sky Haven Temple with Esbern and Delphine, they find an Akaviri shrine to Reman I. Reman I, you'll recall, halted the Akaviri invasion of Tamriel during the Second Era at Pale Pass with the power of his Thu'um. When the Dragonguard heard it, they dropped to their knees and pledged themselves to his service. The Dragonguard, upon building Sky Haven Temple, locked it by a shrine to Reman, including a blood seal and a giant bust of Reman himself. The blood seal responds to the blood of a Dragonborn. Either that means that all Dragonborn are related (which would lead to some odd lineage), or Dragon Blood is shared between all Dragonborn.

This all worked well until *Dragonborn*, though. A lot of people misinterpreted what happened with Miraak and it set this debate up once again. A summary:

Once you arrive in Solstheim and head up to the Temple of Miraak, you see eight dragon skeletons lying on the ground outside the Temple. One skeleton is featured prominently within the Temple. Remember this. Once you enter the Temple and find a certain object, you are transported to Apocrypha, the realm of Herma-Mora, where Miraak easily defeats you in combat. From this point on, if you kill a dragon before ending the *Dragonborn* main questline, Miraak will show up, taunt you a little, and steal the soul from you. At the end of the questline, you fight Miraak, who absorbs the souls of three additional dragons before being battered down to low health. Once you defeat him Herma-Mora will tear open a rift from Apocrypha and gore Miraak through with a tentacle. As he withdraws it, Miraak's skin burns away, and you suddenly get ten dragon souls plus however many Miraak stole from you.

A lot of people take the skeletalization of Miraak and the ten souls you receive as you absorbing his soul somehow. There are two issues with this idea. First, Miraak has nine skeletons displayed proudly before you even meet him, and devours three during your final battle. That's twelve, plus however many he steals from you. By rights, you ought to receive more dragon souls from him. But that numbering makes it impossible for Miraak's soul to be one of those ten you receive regardless. Second, Miraak is Dragonborn, and by everything else we know about individual Dragonborn, they have mortal souls (able to be manipulated by magic, enantiomorph, and free will) and dragon's blood. Why would one Dragonborn be different (and it not be Alessia, who is different simply because of her unique circumstances), or rather, why would the first Dragonborn be different than every other Dragonborn in history?

I propose two alternatives to this flawed idea, connected at the hip, but distinct. 

First, Miraak has nine skeletons in and around his Temple, and three additional dragons die in the final battle mean that we get their souls, rather than his. Second, he was the Champion and servant of Herma-Mora, who ultimately killed him by goring him with a tentacle. This was obviously an act of anger, and Herma-Mora exacted his final revenge. He burned Miraak's body, released his souls, and gave them to you, his new servant and Champion.

Now, I don't have space to expand on Alessia's special type of Dragonborn, but I'll give a link and a statement. The covenant she made with Akatosh was in blood. Akatosh is a dragon. He gave her his blood. [This is her covenant.](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1421186-hold-on-saint-alissia-was-the-first-dragonborn-what-you-talkin-bout-beth/page__st__30__p__21748685#entry21748685)

All this to say: being Dragonborn is a mixing of dragon's blood and mortal soul.

By Levan Matius


The mammoths of Skyrim are truly remarkable creatures, standing nearly twenty feet tall, and covered in fur. A long snout and four ivory tusks protrude from it's face, making the beast easily recognizable. They can be found in many of Skyrim's holds, in particular, Whiterun, the Pale, and Eastmarch. They are often seen alongside the fearsome giants, which may explain why little is truly known about the mammoths. The aim of this essay is to provide some insight on these magnificent creatures.


Firstly, what is the relationship between the mammoths and the giants? We know that the giants herd the mammoths, but to what end? Sacks of mammoth cheese can be found in most giant camps, suggesting that the giants rely on them for food, but it seems that the mammoths are not seen as mere cattle, but are prized companions. Giant-tamed mammoths are distinguishable by the [intricate carvings in their tusks](http://i.imgur.com/t0bvnFk.jpg), revealing that a great deal of care is shown towards them.


It is interesting to note that mammoth skulls found in the wild have no markings upon their tusks. What happens to the remains of tamed mammoths? Some travelers have observed giants standing forlornly beside mammoth corpses, as if they were in mourning. While this may well be true, it may be that they are waiting for the body to decompose so they can transport the bones to their camp. Indeed, many [mammoth skulls](http://i.imgur.com/Vwtwxij.jpg) can be found in [giant camps](http://i.imgur.com/uw6kPU7.jpg), placed up high, almost as if they were objects to be revered.


Some scholars say that the mammoths are held in such high regard because they are, in fact, female giants. Needless to say, this has unpleasant implications, but they reason that it is why there are only male giants in Skyrim. There are a few flaws with this argument. If the absence of female giants can be explained by this, then why do we not see any giant children? Furthermore, the existence of wild mammoths shows that they can reproduce without the intervention of giants.


It seems unlikely that the mammoths are used as mates, but the fact remains that giants hold them in great esteem. In comparison, the more civilized races of Tamriel treat them terribly. It could still be said that we value them, though mainly for their tusks, fur, and meat.


Mammoth tusks can be made into many things. When ground into a fine powder, a tusk can be used as an ingredient in alchemy. It has the potential to restore stamina, but can just as easily create a poison that causes a person to run away in fear. Ultimately, it is not too useful, so people tend not to turn the tusks into powder. As a result, this ingredient is very rare.


Tusks can also be used to create jewelry. Ivory rings are popular among the upper class citizens of Skyrim. Not to mention, the tusks themselves are valued as trophies.


The khajiit in particular seem to have an obsession with mammoth tusks and fur; khajiit caravans in Skyrim seek the tusks, and traders as far as Anequina and Pellitine are known to sell mammoth hides.


Furthermore, a mammoth has enough meat to feed a dozen people for over a month. The snout is the tastiest part, but the rest of the meat is invaluable to smaller communities.


It is regretful that we mainly interact with the mammoths by butchering them, as they truly are wonderful beasts. While the giants are seen as uncivilized by many, their relationship with the mammoths may just be something to be envied. This is exemplified in the poem Ode to the Tundrastriders:


""One in nature, each relying upon the other, more than just man and beast, but equals who need one another to survive.""

There.  Everybody done giggling?  Okay, me too.

Now that my activity in the Amaranth Hunt is finally dying down somewhat, I'm taking the time to start analyzing the 36 Lessons in serious, exhaustive detail.  It's something I've been wanting to do for some time.  And the first thing I wanted to start with was the perceived disparity between Vivec's actions and what he seems to call ""Love.""

In the 36 Lessons Vivec spends a lot of time trying to impress upon the reader how important it is to ""know Love"" and to ""practice"" it.  But it immediately becomes apparent that Vivec's concept of Love is quite different from the traditional modern Western concept.

It didn't take much digging to discover that Vivec's Love is quite a lot like Aleister Crowley's Love, which is defined as **any action or motion that is performed or experienced under Will**.

So to explain Love we have to talk about Crowley's concept of Will.

This isn't a concept entirely specific to Crowley's work in Thelema, his system of spiritual philosophy, because it is mentioned on occasion in the 36 Lessons, even as early as Lesson 1:

'For I have crushed a world with my left hand,' he will say, 'but in my right hand is how it could have won against me. Love is under my will only.'

Thelema does not differentiate between an individual and God: ""Every man and every woman is a star.""  The Lessons do not differentiate either.  Vivec, Sotha Sil, Almalexia and Nerevar are all closely tied to the star symbol.  In Sermon Two, Vivec is described as being star-shaped.  In Sermon 36, those who looked upon Ayem are overcome by the meanings of the Stars.  And Dagoth Ur promises that he brings a Star, which is himself.  Within every person lies the divine, and the Lessons suggest that this is more evident in the powerful and the god-like.  But it is obvious that the Lessons wish us to pursue our own Stars, which in turn is the pursuit of the divine in all of us.

""Will"" is probably the most important concept in Thelemetic thought, and it is probably easiest to define it as the destiny particular to each and every individual.  So it is suggested that a person acting in concert with that person's true Will is acting in a divine manner.  Thus the most popular phrase of Thelema: ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.""

This is not ""desire.""  Thelema does not encourage people to go around doing whatever they want.  Instead, Will is only ""in every way perfect"" if it is unassuaged of purpose and delivered from the lust of result.  Will must be done without mind or reason, as these are a hindrance to the will of the individual (and remember: every man and every woman is a star).  And Will must be done without any desire for a result, because that desire clouds our judgment.  Acting with (and not against) our Will requires a sort of void of mind, much like the void receptacle at the center of the promise of the wise.

Love is only true Love when it is ""under Will.""  While Will is the Law, the nature of that Will is Love.  It is the assimilation of experience, the bi-product of Will.  While the Lessons offer very few examples of Love in an easy to discern form, Crowley gives us plenty of it.  It is not what most people consider the act of loving someone emotionally, or kindness, or sentimentality.  ""Hate itself is almost like Love,"" writes Crowley.  It is perhaps easy to think of Love as the joining of the enantiomorphic concepts of Nuit and Hadit, Crowley's terms for the immeasurable all-being (Nuit) and the infinitely small center point of everything (Hadit).  Perhaps we can find a common theme with Anu and Padomay?

So, in summary: Love (when done under Will) is **the assimilation of experience in accordance with the intrinsically divine nature of an individual**; the act of progressively becoming one with our own Star.

Okay, now let's speculate:  Why Love?

To Love in Mundus means action with the goal of becoming divine.  Vivec does not live in our world, a world where the conceptualization of the divine is difficult and obscure.  It is not impossible for the average Elder Scrolls character to look divinity in the face, though it may take many forms.  But Vivec suggests that every mortal can become divine by simply acting in accordance with their true divine nature, their Will.

In the Lessons, Vivec tells us: ""Love is under my will only.""  But I think Vivec is also convinced, perhaps correctly, that his Will is the same Will as every other mortal in his domain.  He fully possesses knowledge of the metaphysical structure of the entire span of existence, so perhaps he is correct.  Or perhaps he believes that there are common events and activities all mortals must universally experience before they gain the wisdom to pursue their own Stars.

Before, we've all interpreted Vivec's actions in the Lessons as having an undertone of ""this is for your own good.""  I think that's a simplification of this concept of Love.  I strongly suspect Vivec intended to move the entire mortal existence forward, towards the Stars, even if he had to drag them kicking and screaming.

I'd like to take the time to cite some sources.

 **Happy anniversary (once again) from /u/lilrhys and /u/Prince-of-Plots. This is an update to the [Merry CHIMmas](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/np26d/merry_chimmas_rteslore/) post by PoP at the end of last year. A lot of you are much the wiser about this than when it was first posted and so this update will hopefully be more accurate and comprehensive than the previous one but will still help newer members of our subreddit.**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To understand CHIM you must firstly understand that the whole of the TES universe is the dream of the Godhead, an unknown entity turned schizophrenic by the raging battle between the 'Order' of Anu and the 'Change' of Padomay. This 'dream' is subgradient which means that each level of the dream (Void to Aurbis to Mundus) are lesser parts of the dream. Therefore all the beings seen in the Elder Scrolls games are parts of the Godhead, as is the player character him/herself. 

CHIM, is the realisation that you are a part of this Godhead whilst also being an individual within it. Failure to realise the second part leads to zero-summing, which is blanking out of the dream. It is called zero-summing because of the equation that is needed to attain CHIM. In order to attain CHIM you must balance the 'I AM' (of existence) and the 'I AM NOT' (of non-existence) and still conclude that 'I AM' or adding 1 and -1 and still getting 1. If you get 0, you zero-sum out of existence, which is not desired.

Examples of those who have attained CHIM are Talos and Vivec. They attained CHIM by using the method of the Tower which is explained by Vivec himself in [his teachings](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tower). In order to find the Tower you must first see [the wheel](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Dharma_Wheel.svg/220px-Dharma_Wheel.svg.png), which is the structure of the TES universe. In the centre you have Mundus which is the hub of the wheel. The 8 spokes of the wheel are the 8 givers who are known best as the 8 Divines. The gaps between these 8 spokes number 16 and represent the 16 Daedric Princes. 

&gt; We are the hub, the Mundus that goes by many names. We are the heart of all creation. What does this mean? Why should we care? Lorkhan created it so that we could find what he did. In fact, and here is the secret: the hub is the reflection of its creators, the circle within the circle, only the border to ours is so much easier to see. Stand in its flux and remain whole of mind. Look at it sideways and see the “I”.

As Vivec states. Look at the Wheel sideways and you see the 'I' of the Godhead. The singular which dreams the plurals. This sudden realisation is what kickstarts CHIM. This quote, however, shows more than how to reach CHIM, it also explains Lorkhan's purpose. Lorkhan saw the Tower without the Wheel when he travelled to the edge of the Aurbis:

&gt;  As the gods and demons of the Aurbis erupted, the get of Padhome tried to leave it all behind for he wanted all of it and none of it all at once. It was then that he came to the border of the Aurbis.

&gt; He saw the Tower, for a circle turned sideways is an “I”. This was the first word of Lorkhan and he would never, ever forget it.

Lorkhan saw the Tower and realised that he was a part of the Godhead but somehow he did not attain CHIM and neither did he zero-sum. What we do know though is that it inspired him to create Mundus. He created it so others could attain CHIM:

&gt; And this is the most-reached destination of all that embark upon this road. Why would Lorkhan and his (unwitting?) agents sabotage their experiments with the Tower? Why would he crumble that which he esteems?

&gt; Perhaps he failed so you might know how not to.

In order to understand CHIM though you must also understand Love. In order to truly attain CHIM you must also [Know Love](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pojhf/know_love/) although it is true to say that attaining CHIM is actually an act of Egotistic Altruism. Both Vivec and Talos loved themselves so much that by proxy they loved everything else because they were also it. By that logic the applications of CHIM are also bound by Love. After achieving CHIM you become a lucid dreamer within the dream and can begin to change and manipulate the dream since you intimately know the land beneath your feet like you know your hands. However, as I previously stated the CHIM's uses are bound by Love and therefore the only examples we have of CHIM's uses are through Love:

&gt; 'You have suffered for me to win this throne, and I see how you hate jungle. Let me show you the power of Talos Stormcrown, born of the North, where my breath is long winter. I breathe now, in royalty, and reshape this land which is mine. I do this for you, Red Legions, for I love you.' - [From the Many-Headed Talos](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/many-headed-talos) (recited by Heimskr)

Talos loved his warriors and used CHIM to change the landscape of Cyrodiil from jungle to the grasslands we see in Oblivion.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Council,True,t3_13vxkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/13vxkv/chim_chiminey_chim_chiminey/,

It surprises me every day how big we are, and I love it. On that note: we've reached 6000 subscribers! It just doesn't stop.

/r/teslore has the greatest community I've had the pleasure to watch grow and be a part of. I've loved moderating it [since day one](http://i.imgur.com/k0rqo.png), and I've loved hanging out here with the regulars and having such brilliant moderators to help run the place. I'd just like to say thank you to /r/teslore for being as awesome as it is, and I hope it continues to be something awesome for so many people.

This whole thing was meant to be a lot bigger (and I'm sure I'll take the heat from xeno later), but there are a couple of things in celebration coming from the other mods (links below). For now, everybody get in here and join me in celebration of both our anniversary and our 6000 subscriber milestone. This thread also serves as this week's Community Thread.  I don't usually do the ComThreads so I have nothing prepared that would typically be in one, but please talk about anything and everything here.

Also: what will it take to get some folks in the IRC? It's usually a ghost-town, but I've had a ton of fun when there *are* people in there, lore-talk and otherwise.

In case you have never met one of these notoriously rare creatures, Wispmothers are ghostly apparitions that appear to be human or elven in origin, have very powerful frost magic, and have about three or four wisps following nearby. The traits of the Wispmother have been discussed in the in-game book: [The Wispmother](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Wispmother)

In that book it is proposed that Wispmothers are Falmer in origin.

&gt; Based on his extensive research into necromancy and Cyrodiil's Ayleid culture, Master Sadren Sarethi posits that Wispmothers are a necrologic state, a type of lich-dom developed by a now-forgotten First Era culture. Under his theory, these are no mere ghosts - they are a cult of powerful sorceresses who achieved eternal life through undeath.

And being the self proclaimed expert on Ayleids that I am I must say I agree with Master Sarethi. The Ayleids, despite their worship of Meridia, were extremely advanced Necromancers. They managed to develop a way to instantly transform someone into a Lich, so if the Ayleids had advanced Necromantic Magic, why can't the Falmer?

I would also like to show you this close up of a Wispmother and a Falmer (post-corruption). [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/Vocg7.jpg) (credit goes to Saint_Jiub on the forums for it.)

For further evidence I would like you to read a passage out of the book [Lost Legends](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Lost_Legends)

&gt; For generations, the people of Morthal have told whispered tales of the Pale Lady, a ghostly woman who wanders the northern marshes, forever seeking her lost daughter. Some say she steals children who wander astray, others that her sobbing wail strikes dead all those who hear it. But behind these tales may lie a kernel of truth, for ancient records speak of 'Aumriel', a mysterious figure Ysgramor's heirs battled for decades, and finally sealed away.

Aumriel is an elven name if I ever heard one, and the story mentions that the Pale Lady battled Ysgramor's heirs for decades, which indicates elven longevity. and of course you can meet the [Pale Lady](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Pale_Lady_\(creature\)) in Skyrim.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1351804324.0,,Mythic,True,t3_12f6rk,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12f6rk/origin_of_the_wispmother/,

If you are a previous member of the subreddit, thank you for being so great, and remember to follow the rules, hopefully you know them.

This thread is mostly intended for new scholars though, so if you are an oldie feel free to stick around, if not do take your time reading this message, it is quite important.

Dear New Scholars, welcome to /r/teslore. We the mods have noticed an astounding amount of new members in the last few days and week, especially ones emigrating from the subreddit /r/skyrim. /r/teslore is a great subreddit, as some of you might have noticed, and that is due to the fact that our scholars have the dedication and devotion to be able to help out curious folks such as you searching to learn more about the universe of the Elder Scrolls series.

As I've already explained in the Community Thread, quite a few things help scholars become so knowledgeable and organized. Among these things are good sources, cooperation in learning, and deep curiosity. A very crucial part of /r/teslore that is sometimes frequently overlooked by new scholars is focus and relevancy, though. Without staying on focus and keeping relevant to lore in /r/teslore threads, the subreddit devolves into a mess that nobody has time for cleaning up. 

We understand that you all very much like joking around about cheese, skooma, and chickens in /r/skyrim, but we are afraid to tell you that this is not /r/skyrim. It is a different subreddit with a different community and different policies. For example, think of /r/skyrim like the United States and /r/teslore like Europe or the UK. When you go as an American tourist to a European country you should always dress differently because of the colder weather, no? Same goes for /r/teslore and /r/skyrim, you act accordingly depending on which subreddit you are in.

Sadly just today we mods have been forced to remove quite a few comments due to the new populace, but we hope that all you new folks can start getting the gist of the subreddit and assimilate better as time goes by.

The first step in fitting in is reading the subreddit rules and memorizing them. Unlike in /r/skyrim when lots of stuff is accepted no matter how irrelevant or inappropriate, it is different in /r/teslore as we have many restrictions on content and commenting. If you violate any of these rules like many of you have been doing lately, you can be downright sure that I personally will both remove all of your comments and whoop your ass with my banhammer. Sorry, folks, that's just how moderation works.

The 2nd best way to fit in well is to start building a more orderly and organized personality when in /r/teslore. /r/teslore is like a fun, interesting business meeting or school class. You would normally not tell racist jokes and fuck around neither in business meetings *nor* school classes accordingly. Try to imagine yourself like you are in a presidential debate whenever posting in /r/teslore, you will want to show off your intelligence and charisma, not your ability to make puns about dragons.


Last and not least, be nice. Write gently, use comprehensive grammatical and spelling skills, and get to know your fellow scholars like friends. We are all a small, tightly knit community in /r/teslore, we don't fight or offend here. 

With that all good and said, I do hope that I will get to know all you new scholars better in the future and see some good activity from you. Follow the subrddit guidelines well and be active in the community and you can be sure that you will gain the subreddit and its moderators' respect.

Thank you for reading and have a good day.

1355832371.0,96,self.teslore,151r8r,Orsinium and the Orcs: After the Warp in the West [x-post from /r/Orsimer],myrrlyn,104,8,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/151r8r/orsinium_and_the_orcs_after_the_warp_in_the_west/,"The Orsimer have appeared in all games. Initially (*Arena* and *Daggerfall*) they were merely NPC monsters, and it was not until *Morrowind* that they became a playable race. Although their initial monster status can be ascribed to the common view that it wasn't until *Morrowind*'s development that lore really began to take place, I believe that this reflects very well with the established lore of Tamriel.

Orcs, despite their roots as Aldmer and having never lost sentience, have been viewed as monsters from the first day of their changed form. They and their god Malacath, whom I discussed previously, are outcast from their communities and seen as disgusting, bestial, and unwanted. The Orsimer have animalistic qualities (green skin, bone ridges, the massive mandible fangs, and their behavior inherited from the Trinimac-to-Malacath transformation) and are arguably the most barbaric of the Ten Races. From the Merethic Era onwards, they have been reviled, spurned, feared, and fought by all they met.

It is little wonder, then, that the Eternal Champion and the Blades Agent should also see Orcs as beasts. No better than goblins or ogres, Orcs are merely stronger than goblins and more clever than ogres. They roam Tamriel and attack fiercely on sight, for millennia of conflict has left a mutual distrust. The Orcs attack to defend themselves from Tamriel, and Tamriel attacks to defend themselves from the Orcs.

Although the Orcish talent at metalworking has been known for some time by the events of *Daggerfall,* it is seen in the same regard as a hound's hunting ability. The animal over here can track and kill things, and the animal over there can bash metal and make it come out strong. Both may be used, but neither is trusted.

By the time the Blades agent ventured forth to the Iliac Bay, a leader had risen among the Orcs. Gortwog gro-Nagorm unified his people and managed to reforge Orsinium (Aldmeri word for Pariah Town). Gortwog was contending with the kingdoms of High Rock and Hammerfell to have Orsinium become a kingdom in its own right, and managed to meet with the Agent and, when the Warp occurred, was one of the parties to gain control of the fearsome Numidium.

The actual events of the Warp are, of course, unknowable. Over the course of two days, as far as the rest of Tamriel was concerned, Daggerfall, Sentinel, Wayrest, and Orsinium ALL managed to seize the Numidium, conquer their surroundings and possibly even each other, and come out on top.

Dragon Breaks make bad acid look calm and rational.

Regardless, after the dust had settled both in time and in space, Orsinium was now a strong, independent entity. It was able to show that the Orcs were not monsters but mer (though they are alone in the Elvish community in that they forsake their Aldmeri name Orsimer in favor of the human word Orc - likely because the elves cast them out as inferiors, while men merely fought them as equals), and Gortwog began requesting a grant from the Empire for his territory to be recognized as a province in its own right.

With the events following the Warp, the Orcs achieved recognition as a civilization and not as animals. Though the rampant hostility would never vanish entirely, Gortwog was able to set about diminishing it.

Shortly after the Warp, the Nerevarine encountered Orcs in Morrowind. Following in the footsteps of their kin to the west, these Orcs were civilizing themselves and were treated as such by the Dunmer (still poorly, but they were not put down on sight). Cyrodiil's Champion encountered even more integration of Orcs into society, as their innate metalworking skill made them prized to the Legion, and thus the Empire.

By the time the Dovahkiin arose, Orcs had made a name for themselves over the course of two hundred years, and managed to reach a middle level of social integration. Though they were no longer the feared monsters of the night, they were not welcomed with open arms either. Many Orcs chose to remain isolated in Strongholds, four of which dot Skyrim's countryside. Those who live in the cities form the next large group of the population. They are almost always smiths or smelters. It is common practice for Orcs to enlist in the legion, and their armor is highly prized.

A small number of Orcs have managed to become successful members of society. The famed High Rock chef known only as the Gourmet was revealed to be a wandering Orc. Gortwog was a successful politician. There are rumors that the Nerevarine, Champion, and Dragonborn were all Orcs, but every race claims that one of their own was these legendary, mysterious heroes.

In any case, it is indisputably seen that Gortwog's visionary push to create Orsinium and reshape the common view of the Orcs succeeded in transforming them in Tamriel's eyes from beasts and monsters into members of society. He certainly did not take away their fangs, but he did change their appearance.

As all the races of Tamriel can show, not just the Orcs, civilization isn't about actions, behavior or achievement. The self-possessed Altmer can be just as vicious and violent, the Dunmer are even more xenophobic, the Argonians as hostile to interlopers. Civilization is about clothes, metaphorically and literally. That is the gift of Gortwog.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Moth,True,t3_151r8r,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/151r8r/orsinium_and_the_orcs_after_the_warp_in_the_west/,

1358881229.0,95,self.teslore,172iwb,Aka-What? A run-down of the horrible and confusing mess that we know as the Dragon God of Time,,110,15,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/172iwb/akawhat_a_rundown_of_the_horrible_and_confusing/,"This post has been quite a long time in coming, and has existed in quite a few different forms before I chose this one. It's been a short story, a more poetic telling (think *Beowulf*), an in-character treatise, and a few other failed ideas. The reason I've decided to do this in as straightforward a way as possible has quite a lot to do with the subject matter: Time is one of the most convoluted aspects of TES lore, and its Keeper is even more so. I figured, I'd might as well lay everything out simply and clearly, to avoid confusion that springs up from more layered approaches. I'm taking TES history and filling the gaps with conjecture. YMMV. That said, let's begin.

---

In most creation myths, the two primordial forces come into being first. Anu and Padomay, brothers before anything else, exist. Then, at some nebulous point afterwards, the idea of Time is realized. I'll call this force Aka, or ""dragon"".  But at some point, Aka Broke. This unrecorded Dragon Break, the first of many, left behind a different being than Aka, Aka-Tusk. And from Aka-Tusk, we get some familiar names.

First came Alduin, in shape similar to Aka. Alduin is a great Dragon, and his role won't be clarified until later. As of this point, he has no role that we can tell.

Then, came Auri-El. Auri-El is subgradient to Anui-El, who is him/itself subgradient to Anu. Similarly, though he doesn't enter into the story in full yet, is Lorkhan, subgradient to Sithis, subgradient to Padomay.

Alduin and Auri-El are the first aspects of what will later come to be known as the Aka-Tusk oversoul. An oversoul is simply a collective of souls or aspects that form one greater being, despite being singular in and of themselves. So, Alduin exists independently of Aka-Tusk, but also makes up part of Aka-Tusk.

Then comes the event known as Convention. While all of creation has been going on, the subgradients have flowed down, and Lorkhan devises the Mundus. He appeals to Magnus, who builds it, but realizes the trap it presents, and flees with his followers, the Magne Ge, into Aetherius, tearing holes into the Mundus. Meanwhile, Auri-El and the rest of the original spirits that have come to be known as different names to different peoples are trapped in the Mundus, specifically on Nirn, and the Daedra are outside it in Oblivion, laughing hysterically at their kin's misfortunes.

Auri-El, together with his Shield-Thane Trinimac, confronts Lorkhan over what they perceive as trickery. Tensions escalate, and Lorkhan's Heart is ripped out, and shot across Tamriel into the waters. It will later cause the formation of Red Mountain, and indeed all of Vvardenfell. And the system of kalpas begins.

From this point on, things go on in much the same manner over each kalpa, until the current one. Things begin to go a bit screwy here.

Alduin decides to ignore his calling. My own personal theory is that Lorkhan whispered the truth of the Tower to Alduin, and asked him to enforce the cycle with his dying breath, but I've got no evidence to back it. In any event, Alduin goes rogue, and selfishly comes into the world to enslave it rather than to eat it. He and his dragon kin enslave the Nords, who were Lorkhan's chief followers during the battle before Convention. They force them to create a Cult where the Nords worship the dragons as living gods, which goes largely uninterrupted until the Nords rebel. Initially, they had no chance, but one of the kinder original spirits (whom the Nords call Kyne), appealed to Alduin's second-in-command. Together, they taught the Nords how to Shout as dragons do, and their tyranny was thrown off. The Dragon Cult and its remaining adherents are slowly hunted down until they all die out.

But while the Children of the North are fighting and throwing down their old masters with sword and Voice, their southron cousins are rebelling as well. The Cyrods were enslaved by the Ayleids, the Heartland High Elves, who came out of the Aldmer of the Summerset Isles, who were Auri-El's chief followers. They took the humans as their slaves because they saw them as lesser beings, and built a great city in the shape of a Wheel, with a Tower in the middle. Eventually, a slave named Alessia led her kin against their masters, and the routed the elves out of Cyrodiil. They fled into Valenwood, and out of the pages of history. Alessia was crowned Empress, and the First Empire was born. The Nords came down in the waning years of her life and joined the Alessian Order, a group dedicated to eradicating any mer they came across. They wondered at the Cyrods' gods, for they had simply taken the Ayleids' gods from them and given them new names, save one. Among these was Akatosh, their name for Auri-El. The god that was wholly Cyrod was Shezzar. Shezzar was the god of Man, the Missing God, the first Plus One to the Eight of the Alessian pantheon. Shezzar, of course, is another name for Lorkhan.

In time, the races of men, joined by their kin from Yokuda, took most of Tamriel, though they could not wrestle Valenwood or Morrowind from the grip of mer, nor did they attempt to conquer the alien land of Argonia.

But our focus needs to hone in on one particular event.

On her deathbed, Shezzar appeared to Alessia, and gifted her with the Amulet of Kings. Her soul went into the Amulet, and was the first of many that entered into the oversoul it created. The Empire passed to her descendants, and the Alessian Order kept up purging elves from the lands of men.

But something entirely different, unique, happened. A radical sect of the Order, led by their prophet Marukh, were furious that their chief god Akatosh was simply Auri-El in all but name, and so they devised a cunning plan. They went to the top of White-Gold Tower, and danced a powerful dance. And the Dragon broke again, this time for a little over a thousand years.

During this Dragon Break, untime reigned. [To get a better understanding of untime, go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16ns8f/marukhati_time_travel_and_the_tower/c7xpdmg). I don't have the space to explain it here. The Marukhati Selectives tinkered with the original spirit known as Auri-El (and now Akatosh). They freed Auri-El from the Aka-Tusk oversoul, cleansing him from it, and cementing Akatosh, an empty husk, in his place. Next, and most crucially, they took Shezzar, and stuffed all of him into the husk of Akatosh. So Akatosh became both [Dragon and Man](http://images.uesp.net/2/22/OB-Window-Akatosh.jpg). 

This happening in untime is key: from that time forward, backward, and into every kalpa, every possibility, Akatosh took Auri-El's place, as did Shezzar. They were one, Auri-El, Akatosh, and Shezzar. Which means Lorkhan and Auri-El are united in Akatosh. Akatosh is the schizophrenic, two-headed Dragon-Man god of Time. And yet Auri-El was gone from Akatosh, leaving a curious quirk to him.

That means that Akatosh was actually the being who blessed Alessia, who gave the gift of Dragon Blood to Men, because Shezzar is no more. That's why he's the Missing God.

So what does this mean for our oversoul? Aka-Tusk used to be Alduin and Auri-El, along with a few other named aspects that aren't important right now. Aka-Tusk is now, and now forever has been and will be, Alduin and Akatosh, who is Shezzar (Lorkhan) and Auri-El (Akatosh). Akatosh is greater than Aka-Tusk, for he exists inside and outside of Aka-Tusk. The parts are greater than the whole. Akatosh replaces the concept of Aka-Tusk in the minds of the peoples of Tamriel, even reaching as far as to supplant the idea of Aka-Tusk as Bormahu, as Father, to the dragons.

Akatosh has given mortals throughout time the gift of Dragon Blood, most notably and recently the Last Dovahkiin. The man known as Miraak was the first, Alessia was the first to rule, and the first to give her soul into the Amulet of Kings, and there have been many others over the years, from Wulfharth the Underking to Tiber Septim himself, who became Talos and strengthened Convention.

And that's Akatosh, in brief.

---

So where does this leave our messy conglomerate?

Auri-El is free. He escaped the Mundus thanks to the Marukhati Selectives. He now exists independently of Akatosh, and is known as an Eagle because that's what the Aldmer saw. He was a Dragon before the Selectives, and is an Eagle now that the Dragon was scrubbed off of him.

Alduin is still in the oversoul, which Akatosh has by and by large replaced. He is Akatosh's older brother, the First-born, even though he is technically now Akatosh's First-born. He too exists independently of Akatosh, but his role is greatly diminished by his own choices. His brother-father-friend (that's the Lorkhan bit, friend) punished him by blessing one more mortal with the blood of the Dragon.

Shezzar is no more. Shor is untouched, and Lorkhan is untouched, but Lorkhan and Shor are both intimately connected to Akatosh now.

Aka-Tusk exists as a concept. His oversoul still holds Akatosh, Alduin, and the other names for the Time Gods of other cultures. but Akatosh is far larger than him, and though he is a part of the oversoul, he has supplanted Aka-Tusk. In this way, Aka-Tusk exists only as the oversoul, the link between all the aspects he once possessed.

Akatosh is Auri-El and Lorkhan mixed, into one mind. He's absolutely stark raving mad, owing to these two forces battling in his mind all the time. He is bigger than his father, and has become a replacement for his father. He is Alduin's younger brother, the Second-born, and Alduin is his First-born and brother. So yes, Thromgar Iron-Head, Alduin is not Akatosh. But he also is. And also never was. And also always was.

So, what do you think? I realize this is rather complicated stuff. Is there anything I could explain better? If so, let me know.

Also, I didn't pull the Lorkatosh thing out of my ass.

1359767966.0,94,self.teslore,17qa79,Addressing a few issues that popped up lately,xenoposeidon,105,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17qa79/addressing_a_few_issues_that_popped_up_lately/,"Hello, Scholars,

I am sure you are all aware of the changing state of the subreddit due to the sharp increase in popularity lately. I am also sure that many scholars see some issues that happen with this wave of popularity, so I am here now to address a few of those, as well as some other long-lived issues that seems to become larger as discussion becomes larger and more common.

First and foremost I'd like to talk a little about the difference between Gameplay and Lore. By now I hope that any new or old user seeking to contribute to the subreddit has read our subreddit rules. Two of our most important rules are, as noted in the sidebar:

""Submissions must be lore-relevant and should not cross the line between lore and gameplay.""

and

""Comments must be relevant to lore. This rule does not apply within the Weekly Community Thread.""

These two single rules are what separates /r/teslore from any other TES-related subreddit, thus creating an establishment of scholarly attitude and organized discussion that could not be seen in most other TES subreddits, so it should be clear why these are heavily enforced. As of right now, I'd like to talk more specifically about this part:

&gt; should not cross the line between lore and gameplay

This is a very important distinction. A comment or post relevant to lore is anything that **directly** talks about, explains, asks about, or creates/disproves lore. Note the word direct, it is very important. Comments about gameplay that *relate* to lore in one way or another are  related to lore, yet not relevant. 

Lately we have seen some comments claiming something along the lines of: ""If I create this character and play him/her in the lore, then my character is lore-relevant, and so is my comment"". 

This is not true. At all. Again, just because your character *relates* to the universe doesn't mean that it or your comment is relevant. Let me try and show an example of what a relevant and irrelevant comment would look like:

Relevant comment (in the context of an ingame character):

""Making your character an Orc would mean that, in-universe, certain people of several races should have a sub-average level of respect for your character, due to the fact that in the history of Tamriel Orsimer were disrespected and exiled by the other races.""

Irrelevant comment:

""If you are roleplaying an Orc, I would suggest first of all investing time in Smithing skill cause then you can make lots of weapons as well as level quickly. Once you get the smithing skill to 100 you can roleplay the Orc is being like a master smith, I guess""

Note that the relevant comment had specific facts about and talked about Tamrielic history, as well as made a good try at trying to incorporate the character into existing lore. Now note the irrelevant comment, while being probably helpful and containing some good info, had no facts whatsoever about lore, only about roleplaying and gameplay.

Note this idea does not only apply to gameplay, it also applies to many other types of comments such as joke comments and roleplaying comments. Most (and probably all) joke comments do have some relation to lore, yet do not talk about directly in any way, which is why you will see most of these comments removed. Same goes for roleplaying comments, comments such as responses to different comments with an in-character tone almost always have some relation to lore, and yet do not talk about lore directly in any way.

The only exceptions to this rule in normal threads are any comment that can be considered a scholarly response. Comments such as ""I extremely enjoyed this post, I found it to be extremely interesting"" are allowed as long as they are not the only comments that come out. If you do make one of these comments we also suggest you include a more lore-relevant response in the comment. The reason these are allowed is because they are basically another way of approving a theory or Apocrypha, and approval of ideas is something needed in any scholarly institution.

Alright, got that? Good, let's move on. Don't worry, the long text is over soon.

One other issue I'd like to discuss is the issue of comments restricting discussion.

It is an issue we have soon semi-commonly this last year, yet it seems to be becoming larger and larger as time passes and scholars get more experienced.

Some scholars, old and new, have in their mind the idea that a scholar's understanding of the lore can and should come above the need for discussion. In more simple words, what we are seeing is users claim that because one user has a better understanding of a subject than others, his/her contributions to the topic are the only ones that matter and any contradictions are immediately wrong. This is bad.

The most commonly we see this pattern is in threads asking about specific races or cultures. We in the subreddit have some very intellectual and determined scholars that have risen up as ""experts"" about specific cultures, some of which to give credit to are Myrrlyn, OPgreenback, Mr_Flippers, Lebiro, and myself. When a question or post regarding a specific race or culture pops up, we almost always see comments claiming or suggesting that without the response or consent of the specific users named above (and others like them), all other comments or theories are invalid. We, the moderators, would just like to announce that from now on these comments will be devalued and even removed.

The reason we dislike these comments is because they restrict discussion. /r/teslore is a subreddit dedicated to discussing and debating certain subjects, and anything that limits the subreddit's capability to do its job is bad for the subreddit. Once you have a comment claiming, for instance, ""If you have a question about sload, just wait for /u/Sload_MasterxX to arrive, he knows the most about Sload"", it is immediately suggested that any other comment in that thread except the comment made by /u/Sload_MasterxX is either wrong or does not contain enough information. And when that is assumed, these comments are not responded to and so discussion is canceled.

I hope you are understand what I'm getting at here. I'm sure all us ""Subject Experts"" are honored by your respect, but we do all wish for more discussion is the lack of monopolization of knowledge by one individual.

---

So, in summary, please do try to understand the border between lore-relevancy and lore-acknowledging content, as well as try to promote discussion instead of restricting or monopolizing it.

That is all, thank you for taking the time to read, and have a great day!

1371870425.0,91,self.teslore,1gu4qy,"Vivec, Amaranth, Life",RottenDeadite,99,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1gu4qy/vivec_amaranth_life/,"Part of what mystifies many people about Vivec and the Dunmer Velothi religion is the idea of Daedra Worship.  Why would anyone willingly worship a force that can be called, at the best of times, indifferent?

**In Love with Evil**

The answer lies in the general philosophy of Daedra worship, one that is echoed in [the Scripture of the Sword](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_23).  It is the quest to rid your garden of weeds, to cut yourself into better shapes.  The Sword is Discipline, self-improvement, slicing the fat from the lean.

How does Daedra worship contribute to this?  Vivec knew, and he demonstrates it by submitting to the will of Molag Bal in [Sermon 14](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_14).  By continuously supplicating yourself to a higher power that seeks to harm you, you can learn how to remain unharmed.

Let's talk about [Dark Souls](http://www.preparetodie.com/) for a second.  Don't let that segue give you whiplash.

**Discipline**

You've fought hard to a new boss and the moment you step into the room it swings a sword and kills you dead.  Instead of giving up, or fighting an easier boss, you just head back in there again, and you get killed repeatedly until you figure out how to survive in that demon's presence.  Perhaps you seek the council of others who have come before you, and they help as they can.  By the time you've killed it, you're leaner for the learning.

This is what is meant by the concept of being ""cut"" into better shapes.  The cutting is painful, but the end result is worth the pain.  If you want to lose weight, you run, you exercise.  The exercise is painful, but the effort is worth the work.  Nothing easy is worth doing.  All worthwhile self-improvement is going to involve pain.  Life is pain.  Anyone who says differently is selling something.

Daedra worship is very similar.  To understand how the Dunmer choose to worship their Daedric Lords, we have to talk a little bit about [BDSM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BDSM).

Is your neck okay?  Maybe you should sit down.

**Dominance and Submission**

One of the more difficult concepts to grasp in Bondage/Domination/Sado-Masochism is also the most obvious: why would anyone voluntarily put themselves through torture?  The answer is in the Dominant / Submissive (Dom &amp; Sub) relationship, and the concept of the [Safe Word](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safeword).

A Submissive is subjected to discipline by the Dominant.  All kinds of horrible things can and will happen.  But when things go too far, the Sub can say the Safe Word, and the Dom will stop performing.  What does all that mean?

The person who is truly in control of the situation is the Submissive, not the Dominant.

The Dunmer are the Subs.  They submit themselves to the dangers and torture of the Daedra, the Doms.  But only voluntarily.  Don't like the way one particular Daedra works?  Go worship a different one.

Of course, some Daedra don't quite get the concept of the Safe Word.  Like bad Dominant performers, they don't get many Subs.  You know which Princes I mean… There's four of them:  BAL, DAGON, MALAC, SHEOG.  [The Four Corners](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:House_of_Troubles) are considered ""Trouble"" because (among other reasons) they're far too selfish, crazy, destructive, or irresponsible to respect the Dom / Sub relationship.  You've got to be a particular brand of awesome to submit to the will of those four.

[In the 36 Lessons](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_31), Vivec tells us directly how we can benefit from submission:

""The last time I heard his voice, showing the slightest sign of impatience, I learned to control myself and submit to the will of others. Afterwards, I dared to take on the sacred fire and realized there was no equilibrium with the ET'ADA. They were liars, lost roots, and the most I can do is to be an interpreter into the rational.""

Vivec submitted to Molag Bal's dominance (I could argue that he is the most domineering of the Daedra)  and learned to control himself.  He became more disciplined by allowing himself to be disciplined, to be cut into a better shape.  And in so doing, he took another step down the path to attaining CHIM.  A huge step, but at a huge risk, and Vivec was only able to survive that encounter because he had already attained a considerable measure of Mastery.  Among the numerous lessons here: Don't submit to a dominant force you can't control.

Remember what we discussed in the previous section: Discipline is the act of being cut into a better shape.  It is a painful transformation, but nothing easy is worth doing.  I'm hammering this point home because I'm going to address it again in the last section.

**Why Didn't Vivec Become an Amaranth?**

So why, when Vivec attained CHIM, did he not ascend to Amaranth?  Surely he had all the tools at his disposal?

The answer is [Love](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18gt8w/what_is_love/), both the 36 Lessons, Vivec-ish kind, and the traditional affectionate kind.

Vivec says ""I denounce the alienation of the Cloven Duality with a hammer,"" the division between the Divine and the Mortal.  He says ""I AM AND I ALL ARE WE,"" and that is not hyperbole.  He knows that the Daedra are part of the structure of the Wheel, and as such are part of the trap that keeps Mortals from attaining Divinity.  But he also calls them ""The Key and the Lock,"" because the worshipping of Daedra contains the key to freedom from the prison of Mortality: discipline, and the knowledge and ability that comes from it.

By testing themselves against the Daedra, the Dunmer can regain their freedom.  Remember [my article about the Black Hands](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1che6a/mephala_and_the_destruction_of_terror_and_theory/), about learning to control Logic and Terror?  These are only a few of the tools the Dunmer must master before they can survive the denial of the Godhead's truth.

But if Vivec became an Amaranth, what could he offer his people?  Sure, a paradise of safety and bliss, but that would be a temporary paradise, because his people had not become enlightened, as he had.

Vivec knew that everyone must attain CHIM.  Everyone must endure the torture of discipline until they can become as enlightened as he.  This is the process for which Lorkhan created Mundus: not just the evolution of Mortal into Divinity, but the *union* of Mortality and Divinity.  And that is Love.

All of Mundus must become Divine.  Love must be done.  Love requires discipline, and discipline is the product of pain.  Therefore, Vivec did not become the Amaranth, he did not become the Easy Way Out, because to do so would have meant cursing all Mortals to a life of death and blindness.  They would have grown soft, complacent, bitter, angry, rebellious.  That is not enlightenment.  It's not bliss.  It's a curse far truer than anything the Aedra could ever design.

Instead he became the Anticipation of Mephala, a Daedric echo.  Part of the system, a kind but fair warden of a cruel jail.  Vivec ""failed"" to become Amaranth so that he could show us how to do it.

This is the theme that flows in the undercurrents of the Dunmer culture.  They are in love with evil.  And this seems to other TES cultures to be an evil act in itself, but it is far more clever and calculated than that.  The Dunmer are thieves, and they are stealing power from the Daedra by pretending to be submissive.  They *exploit* the Daedra, who act the way they do because they are incapable of doing otherwise.

Maybe this reminds you of other Dark Elf cultures in [other games, other universes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_elf)?  Maybe now you begin to understand just how right Kirkbride &amp; company got it.

**Beyond Elder Scrolls**

Part of the magnificence of Morrowind's contribution to our culture is its philosophy.  That, and enabling me to write incredibly hyperbolic sentences like the previous one.

But this concept of the Dunmer religion is useful in real life.  The idea of embracing Evil, that which would harm us, because with knowledge and ability we gain the confidence to submit ourselves to increasingly harmful experiences with the intent to allow them to improve us.  That improvement is called competence, ability, mastery, learning.

Taking a new, challenging position at your job?  Perhaps you know it will keep you up late, working until the early hours of the morning.  It will sometimes feel like torture.  Do it.

Want to lose ten pounds?  Get abs like a Greek statue?  Time to put yourself through a more intense physical routine.  It's going to hurt.  And you'll love it.

Is your life kicking you in the throat?  Things seem hard, like you can't carry on.  Remember: you will survive.  You must, because this pain will make you better for it.

When I told him about the lowest point in my life, a man I admire told me: ""This is work, this is work.""  Work is hard.  Anything worth doing is hard.  Murder the one who promises you an easier life.

This was Vivec's realization, at the moment of CHIM: Mundus is hell.  All our mortal existence is a dangerous prison designed not to destroy us, but to toughen us, to make us harder, better, faster, stronger.  To ""rescue"" mortality from that prison before it had done its work would have been a punishment, not a reward.

If it was just Relmyna then I would say it was the ravings of a mad person, but Calixto came to the same conclusion despite never meeting her.

By Fralvia Varo


When one thinks of glass, a word such as 'fragile' may spring to mind. Yet there exists glass that can be fashioned into weapons and armor of the finest caliber. How is this possible? Surely such items would merely be of decorative value, as the slightest impact could break them into small pieces?


In truth, glass equipment is not fashioned from the glass that you might find in an ordinary windowpane, which is made principally from sand. In the context of this essay, glass refers to two different materials: raw glass from the province of Morrowind, and malachite from the Northern and Southern extremities of Tamriel.


These materials are both very strong, and share many similarities, which is why many confuse the two. In reality they are very different from each other. Raw glass is more delicate, and is much more valuable. It appears in Morrowind, erupting from the ground in clusters of translucent green shards. Malachite is mined from ore veins, and can be found in Skyrim, High Rock and Alinor. It is much darker in color, but is lighter in terms of weight.


To begin with, what are the peculiarities of raw glass from Morrowind? Most of the glass there could be found in Vvardenfell district, formed by the volcanic activities of Red Mountain. Since the eruption in 4E 5, few have been able to travel to the island of Vvardenfell, so the supplies of glass have dried up.


That isn't to say that it was readily available to all prior to the disaster. In the late years of the Third Era, the East Empire Company had a monopoly on glass, as well as ebony. The Company was sanctioned by the Emperor himself, making glass and ebony smuggling a dangerous, but lucrative trade. Glass in particular was seen as more valuable, as it weighed much less than ebony, but could be sold for a similar price. Those who were weighed down by stolen ebony would have to abandon their gains in order to escape.


For the most part, raw glass would be used in the making of glass armor. A great deal of glass was required to make but a single piece, but the final product would be stronger than steel, and several times more awe-inspiring. The armor is capable of absorbing impacts, but is less durable than ebony. As for bladed weapons, they could be made absurdly sharp, but would be quick to dull. They would have to be repaired frequently to retain their usefulness.


Raw glass is also of use to alchemists. A piece of glass, when mixed with the right ingredients, can create a poison affecting a person's intelligence, strength, or speed. If used correctly, it could also make for a potent fire shield potion.


As the East Empire Company answered to the Emperor, and was a Cyrodiil-based Company, it is only natural that considerable amounts of glass would make it to the Imperial Province. Imperial smiths began to produce their own variant of glass armor, the design of which was received negatively by some. A nobleman, who had commissioned several sets, was outraged when he saw the final product and, after leaving the Imperial City, left them lying on the road. It was said that the pieces were then appropriated by bandits.


Malachite is the second material that can be used to create sturdy glass, and it is generally much more durable than raw glass. The greatest concentration of malachite can be found in Skyrim, though some deposits exist in High Rock and Alinor.


Malachite must be mined and then refined. The Altmer are able to create strong weapons and armor with a few ingots. Most malachite creations in the land of Skyrim are of Altmer origin, as evidenced by the [avian imagery](http://images.uesp.net/8/81/SR-icon-armor-GlassShield.png) in [several](http://images.uesp.net/b/b1/SR-icon-weapon-GlassMace.png) of the [pieces](http://images.uesp.net/a/a0/SR-icon-weapon-GlassWarAxe.png). The eagle, of course, being an important symbol to the Altmer.


Malachite equipment is much more durable than armor made from raw glass, and much lighter too. A full set of glass armor weighs nearly three times more than a set of malachite armor. However malachite armor does have its disadvantages. As an amorphous metal, it conducts electricity. Those who wear it must be careful when fighting mages.


Alchemists of the third era were known to use malachite for its silencing properties, though that particular application has fallen out of practice.


While both raw glass and malachite are very different, they both naturally appear green in color. An interesting property of both is that the color can be changed. There are several methods, but the best known method is to use atronach salts and magic. The application of frost salts tint the glass blue, fire salts turn it red and void salts turn it into a dark grey shade.


However due to the events of the 4E 5, raw glass has become incredibly scarce, so when most people refer to glass armor and weapons, it is actually malachite that they are talking about. While it has been many years since the eruption of Red Mountain, the volcano is still billowing ash, and shows no signs of stopping. If glass miners are unable to return to Vvardenfell, it seems that in the future, glass will come to refer exclusively to malachite.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_1939fw,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1939fw/an_inquiry_into_the_properties_of_glass/,

1338580004.0,85,self.teslore,ug3c1,A note on Imperial names.,lebiro,93,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/ug3c1/a_note_on_imperial_names/,"Okay, so we all know about Nibenay and Colovia. We also know that, while the P.G.E. considers this duality to be a central factor in Cyrodiilic culture and society, it was largely unexplored in ""Oblivion"" (it is mentioned in a few of the generic ""rumours"" topics, for characters with nothing better to say), but there is one way you can see the divide.

If we look at the names of all the Imperials in Oblivion (I'm ignoring the other games for simplicity's sake, hang on), we can see that they can largely be categorised into two groups.

On the one hand, you have names like ""Kastav Kvinchal"" and ""Irlav Jarol"", on the other, you have names like ""Amantius Allectus"" and ""Julitta Plotius"". To me, it seems that the former, with harsher sounds, and an abundance of ""k""s, ""v""s and ""j""s are Colovian names, whereas the Latinesque names are Nibenean. This would fit the rugged Colovians vs smooth Nibeneans idea, of course.

Taking a look, for example, at the Counts. The hereditary count of Chorrol was Charus Valga. ""Charus"" has the Nibenean suffix, but a somewhat Colovian beginning (with the ""Ch"" sound being present in the Colovian ""Chorrol""), suggesting, perhaps, a slight Nibeneanisation, but ""Valga"" is guttural and harsh. On the other hand is Regulus Terrentius, Count of the Nibenean Bravil. Here, of course, all is Latin.

Another useful example is Hackdirt. This is a small Colovian town, where all the families have lived for generations (given the xenophobic and inbred nature of the community there). Just about all the names fit the Colovian category: ""Etira Moslin"", ""Jiv Hiriel"", ""Marlena Brussiner"", ""Natch Pinder"" (note also that ""Pinder"" is the name of a historical hero of Kvatch), ""Vlanhonder Moslin"". it's all guttural, harsh sounds.

There are exceptions to this, and names which I can't place in either. ""Hassildor"" for example, is neither Latinesque or especially harsh sounding, but I would have to guess at Colovian, since I can't imagine a Nibenean ruler of Skingrad (read ""Rislav the Righteous""). This said, ""Janus"" is very Nibenean, so I would suggest a fashion for Nibenean first names among the nobility (see also Arrianna Valga and aforemention Charus). It just seems to me that the clear distinction between names like ""Kastav"", ""Irlav"" and ""Berich"" and ""Arentus"", ""Gemellus"" and ""Herminia"" must have an explanation.

Maybe I've overthought this, and maybe this was painfully obvious to everyone already, but I've been thinking about it for a while, so I've just poured my thoughts out here.

P.S. Also, on the subject of noble names (but not Colovia/Nibenay), the Count of Kvatch is Ormellius Goldwine. ""Ormellius"" is a very Nibenean name, but ""Goldwine"" does not fit either format at all. Imperials do not have descriptive (English) names like this. My theory here is that the Goldwines are of Breton descent (Ordevin or Vindor in ~~French~~ Breton).

Rieklings, the tiny, blue goblin-like beings that inhabit the island of Solstheim are grievously misunderstood and ignored for being ""Stupid"" or ""a nuisance"". I, Crassus Lanius, (author of ""The Thousand-and-One uses for Horkers: A Primer"") set out to investigate these mysterious beings on their home island. What follows are my findings.

* **Architecture**-

Rieklings have a simplistic architecture, consisting of rounded huts and tents. These structures are primarily made from the bones and hides of animals that they've raised or hunted. This includes (but is not limited to) Boars, Foxes, Deer, Skeevers, and more. The huts, generally rounded with an entrance protruding from one side have loose fitting roofs and are only attached to the ground with bone or wood stakes, giving the impression that they can be easily disassembled and moved, should the need arise. Which would insinuate a mostly nomadic culture, however other habits of Riekling society tell otherwise.

* **Religion**-

Riekling religion is a complicated thing and not much is known to us, what we do know however, is the Riekling have a ""godspeak song"" that they preform ritually. The godspeak song involves burning considerable amounts of Scathecraw, native to Morrowind and Solstheim. Scathecraw is dreadfully toxic, so much of the ritual, including how the Rieklings survive it, remains a mystery to us. Popular theory has it that the Rieklings are simply immune to the airborne variants of the Scathecraw toxins, while another theory argues that part of the Riekling godspeak ritual involves a potion which keeps them safe from the toxin. Regardless, more study is required.

Rieklings have no known religious figures, such as the shamans, priests, witches, or medicine men that can be found in other savage cultures like Orcs, and Goblins. When Rieklings wish to preform the godspeak ritual, they simply gather round a fire, burn the Scathecraw and chant in unison, there is no leader.

Who the Rieklings speak to and worship in the godspeak ritual is another topic of much debate, there are two likely contenders for who the Rieklings worship, the first being Hircine, Daedric god of the Hunt, given his history on Solstheim and the Rieklings' hunter-gatherer culture. The other choice would be the All-Maker of the Skaal religion, seeing as the two share an island heavily influenced with shrines of this ""All-Maker"" and the Rieklings have a habit of adopting the cultures and items of those they live close to (see culture). Another theory has presented itself that Rieklings may worship the Orcish Daedra-God, Malaclath. I find these theories to be highly preposterous, as Rieklings live so isolated from his other followers, and so deep in the influence of many other gods and Daedra.

* **Culture**

Rieklings live in tribal villages or groups of 10-50 Rieklings, each filling a specific role in society (Warrior, Hunter, Worker, Boar Breeder) and one leading Chief of the tribe. The chief chooses the days on which godspeak rituals will occur, and leads the Rieklings in whatever endeavors they may be preforming (a hunt, a raid, construction). Rieklings are highly social creatures, who communicate often and quite loudly in their guttural language consisting of clicks of grunts. There are recorded instances of intelligent Rieklings using Tamrielic to communicate with travelers and locals who encounter them.

Riekling leaders are chosen in a way that can be called similar to the way that Orcs choose their chieftains. If and when a Riekling wants to become chieftain, he challenges the current chief to single combat, and, if victorious, becomes the new chief, this way only the strongest rule. There have been extreme and highly unusual and rare scenarios where a non-Riekling can become a chieftain of a Riekling tribe, recorded incidents of this are often ridiculously overexagerrated, but truth can still be found in some. 

Rieklings raise and domesticate Bristleback Boar, which are native to the island of Solstheim. These boar are used in everything from warfare, acting as riding beasts for Riekling warriors, to agriculture, where they are used for meat, to architecture and clothing, where they are used in Riekling huts and armors. 

Riekling clothes and armors are primarily made of bones and furs from the creatures they raise and hunt, most notably Bristleback Boars. However it isn't unusual to see a Riekling wearing a Skeever skull or a feathered headdress. Rieklings have also been known to fashion leather armors, but not regularly enough to be considered commonplace, as the practice of creating such armor has fallen out of, well practice, sometime after the late Third Era. Despite the cold climate of Riekling dwellings in northern Solstheim, Rieklings often only cover about half their bodies in furs and bones, leaving much of their chest, stomach, and arms exposed.

Rieklings have a very simple, yet effective weapon. Tried-and-true, the Riekling spear is a versatile projectile or hand-to-hand weapon fashioned from a sharpened rock attached to a sturdy and straight stick. This weapon proves equally effective being thrown from range, jabbed from up close, or used like a lance while mounted on a Bristleback Boar. Rieklings have also been known to use arrows fashioned by more intelligent races as spears, much to the same effect.

Most notably in Riekling society, is their apparent kleptomania. Rieklings will randomly hoard objects made by others in large amounts in their tribes, sometimes building bizarre shrines from the items they prospected. Rieklings of late have been known to steal ancient weapons and tools from nord crypts, random, generally useless items from the newer Dunmer settlements on Solstheim, tools and animal skins from the northern Skaal, and even scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins. The purpose of this hoarding is as of yet unknown, yet the use of these stolen items in shrines insinuates a religious connotation.

* **Biology**-

Reikling Biology is indeed fascinating, but without the ability to properly sit down and dissect a Riekling myself, there is much I don't know, and other scholars don't care to know. However, a lot can be inferred from just observing Rieklings from a bush outside one of their camps. 

The heart of a Riekling is a powerful thing, working very hard to keep a Riekling warm in the frigid climate of northern Solstheim. It beats much more quickly than the heart of a man or mer, resulting in a very short lifespan for a Riekling. The amount of energy the heart produces results in a great need for energy input. The average Riekling eats as much as a man would in day, despite their small size.

Most interestingly is the sickening crunching noise a Riekling makes between minutes and hours after dying. This writer's best guess is that it has something to do with the cold of the snow, ice, outdoors, or a combination of the three flash-freezing the Riekling's previously hot bones (no doubt so hot from the Rieklings hot blood, being pumped from their immensely powerful hearts). Now, if you've ever dropped a scorching hot rock into water, you've no doubt seen as the rock cracks and sometimes even explodes. I believe that Riekling bones may behave somewhat in the same way; when a Riekling dies, their bones chill very quickly and crack, shatter, or break, creating the noise.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________

I hope that this was both an enlightening view into the uniqueness of Rieklings, and an excellent (if I do say so myself) dissertation on the lives and culture of these remarkable little creatures. I would however like to remind you all that Rieklings are dangerous and unpredictable, so if you should see one, approach with caution, or run away.

1375245969.0,82,self.teslore,1jeh7i,Khajiiti warfare,Mr_Flippers,91,9,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1jeh7i/khajiiti_warfare/,"I've seen this a bit lately, so much like they're relationship with the Thalmor that was misunderstood, Khajiiti warfare will be explored.

Firstly, we know that in any task, Khajiit work together. This applies to anything with the Khajiit, if one form cannot do it then another can and as we've seen in previous threads, Khajiit are very community-minded. Likewise, this is seen in their tactics. Khajiit see advantage in any way and they'll take it. Using the best and almost only source we have, Mixed Unit Tactics talks about the cooperation between the sub-species. Mixed units being the trump card for Khajiit in battle, where most races favour a particular form of warfare Khajiit can perform all of them well.

One thing that is shared amongst all Khajiit, however, is that they won't fight a pointless or hopeless fight. If a Khajiit found himself in front of a group of imperials, you can bet he'd kick him in the nads and run away. Fighting dirty is just fighting for survival and they will run away if they have to, no point in fighting just so your corpse gets praised (however, there are martyrs in Khajiit society, Ri'sallidad). But, Khajiit are all different types all fighting together and in different cultures, so we have to look at these factors too. Culturally first, then through sub-species.

**Anequina**:

""Barbaric"" to the Pelletines (pelletinians, they don't have an official term), they're the more nomadic and ruthless Khajiit who live in the more northern end of Elsweyr, particularly in and around the towns by the Ne' Quin al desert. The conventional combat sub-species would be favorable here and their ""talents"" more suited for this culture. An Anequinine Senche-Raht would be one hell of a force to be reckoned with.

**Pelletine**:

Considered ""decadent"" by the Anequinine Khajiit, these guys are less nomadic and more connected with the rest of Tamriel due to the massive port city Senchal and the proximity with the coast. Also by virtue of the fact that it's mostly jungle and forest as opposed to biting hot desert. Trade and business flourishes in Pelletine and would likewise cause it's fighters to be less ""battle-hardened"" than Anequinine Khajiit. However, this does not mean they are not talented. With the thick and deadly jungles and importance of ""trade"" these guys would be much more accustomed to guerrilla tactics and light, mobile soldiers.

That covering as little as it did, should make a bit more sense when looking at the individual sub-species (that we know of).

**Alfiq**: Very powerful mages and the most magically adept sub-species. This, of course, could be used in a wide variety of roles given the variety of magic schools there are. They're also the size of a house cat, so these guys aren't exactly going to be frontline infantry. Alfiq-Raht would likely be the same case, but bigger in size.

**Cathay**: the subspecies considered to ""make good warriors"" (from Morrowind dialogue) likely due to their size and bipedalism making them able to adapt to using both typical weapons and their own claws. I'd estimate that their size would make the typical Cathay about 1 foot taller than a regular Altmer and Cathay-Raht probably being 2-4 feet taller than Altmer, however we don't officially know their height so we have to resort to conjecture.

**Suthay**: from the same dialogue, these guys don't typically make good warriors, not even Suthay-Raht. However, they'd be much more suited to guerrilla, hit and run tactics due to their stature and affinity for stealth. Suthay-Raht are the sub-species that players in Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim can be. Martial arts would likely be their strong suit and there's plenty of forms for them to learn (and with claws, they really can do some nasty stuff).

**Tojay**: pretty much nothing is known about these guys, other than they're believed to be bipedal.

**Pahmar**: said to be similar to a tiger. I'd say they would be both strong and agile fighters, however also restricted by their paws making them incapable to using weapons. Pahmar-Raht, like the other -Raht types, is likely just a bigger version.

**Senche**: the big boys, these guys are as suited to combat as you could get. Senche-Raht are famously referred to by Imperials as ""battle cats"" and are said to be the size of two Altmer in height and who knows how thick. Thankfully, we have some idea of what they look like beyond being quadrupedal, as the Tale of Dro'Zira informs us that Sabre Cats of Skyrim were formerly Senche that had turned smaller into what they are now (and no, Sabre Cats are not Khajiit). I don't think I have to explain how useful these guys are in a fight.

**Dagi**: as we can see from Mixed Unit Tactics, they're small, agile, tree-dwelling and useful with bows AND magic. Probably as guerrilla as it gets for the Khajiit. However, they're also limited by the fact that they wouldn't be very useful outside of forests and jungles due to one of their best natural talents becomes pointless when there's no trees around. Dagi or Dagi-Raht are probably half the size of a Suthay-Raht (again, just estimation). They're also talented mages and supposedly take advantage of this whilst they're in battle.

**Ohmes**: probably the most suited to traditional warfare with archery or as another kind of light soldier due to their size and Bosmer-like appearance. Probably very useful in an intelligence role due to their appearance and agility; but also more likely used for traditional warfare that Imperials and other man races are more likely to use, though I doubt they excel at it compared to Imperials.

**Ohmes-Raht**: quite different from Ohmes, they actually have tails and light fur. However, they are still very man-like overall and thus would come under similar roles in battle as Ohmes.

Now for some special things

Martial arts in Elsweyr is in no short supply, with the most popular/known forms being Goutfang, Whispering Claw and Rawlith Khaj. Rawlith Khaj having several of its own styles: Rain, Sand, Wind, Sun, Storm, and Two-Moons-Dance. The martial arts themselves are described to be ""of claw and tail"", again playing to the natural advantages Khajiit have, particularly their claws. Likewise, monks have even been said to be some of Elsweyr's greatest warriors when they need to be.

There are still more sub-species of Khajiit that we know *nothing* about. The PGE claims there to be ""over twenty"" and an old MK comment stated there to be 24. But again, we don't know anything about these and can't comment on their usefulness, role, or anything really.

Khajiit armour use is overall still obscured to us. We've heard that they typically use medium armour, but it'd be ridiculous to think that this applies to 16 different types of Khajiit. It's possible that it covers most of the body as it's offensive to expose ones body fur in Khajiiti society, however in battle and especially amongst the more ""barbaric"" Anequinine Khajiit this could be disregarded; we don't really know. However, we do know that they have little regard for heavy armour.

******

To sum it up, Khajiit are a very varied people. They are suited for every task, it's what they were designed for and it is mirrored in their combat. In jungle or desert, big or small, they will fight in any way they can or try again tomorrow when you're not looking.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Moth,True,t3_1jeh7i,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1jeh7i/khajiiti_warfare/,

The recent thread which is still on the front page inspired me to draw from the economic history class I took last quarter. The first half of the post will be the economics and the second will be its application to Tamriel.

Others have made a big deal out of how long the people of Tamriel have spent wallowing in absolute poverty. This state of their world actually corresponds very closely with ours.

An oft-over looked historical fact is that between about 4000 B.C. and 1800 A.D, average income did not increase. The average person worldwide was just as materially well off in Renaissance Italy as they would have been in the first Babylonian Empire.

The best reason that economic historians have for it is something that they call the Malthusian Trap. This ""Trap"" is a multi-step process.

First, economic prosperity increases. This is usually as a result of technological improvement. As a response, population increases. This increased load on the resources brings economic prosperity back down to near the level it was at originally. Eventually calamities and disease will kill off a segment of the population, bringing it back to the level it was before. 

For a better treatment of this see: Structure and Change in Economic History by Douglass North. Also, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_equilibrium

As a result, there is no incentive to innovate. A lack of property laws pre-industrial revolution means you will see little personal gain, and the malthusian trap means society will take two steps forward and two or three steps back! Thus the world pre-industrial revolution was stuck at a level of production from which it could not escape.


When put in that context, it is not surprising to me that we have seen relatively little economic change in the last 200 years in Tamriel, not to mention the thousands before that. Any technology/magical change would help the land to support a higher population, but along with that population comes a greater demand for food and more disease and pretty soon they were back where they started. That's assuming the technology/magic is not lost, which as we've seen is not an uncommon occurrence in the Elder Scrolls saga.

Tamriel is a very violent place. The Great War ended just recently, and there is still a civil war in Skyrim. Any population increases will result in societal pressures that create more bandits, vampires, and the such. Diseases like Brainrot will also be spread more easily from Mudcrabs and Skeevers into the cities.

Now imagine this process playing out over centuries. It isn't some god or demon hindering advancement, nor is it necessarily some fell empire. Rather, it is the consequence of the actions and inactions of the men and mer themselves.

1348597974.0,85,self.teslore,10go5y,The Renaissance that Never was: Or How Azura Destroyed the Enlightenment,thinkpadius,91,6,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10go5y/the_renaissance_that_never_was_or_how_azura/,"**EDIT 3:** Thank you all for your comments and criticisms, it's given me so much more insight into this analysis and I've tried to incorporate your ideas into this more refined post. :) I've also done some editing for clarification.

**EDIT 4:** What is outlined below is a theory that Azura destroyed the Dwemer, and orchestrated the destruction of the Heart of Lorkhan and the Tribunal in order to prevent the knowledge that the she was fallible and on some level was not omniscient. This triggered a series of historical events that left mortals weakened which has resulted in a decline from the Dwemer renaissance to the low middle ages during the time of the Dovahkiin.


**EDIT 1:** Why Would Azura Try to Prevent and Undo a Renaissance?

From the book ""Azura and the Box"" we learn that Azura was tricked by the Dwemer. The Dwemer trick revealed that the Daedric princes aren't omniscient, even if on an incredibly tiny level. From that moment onwards, I think Azura hated the Dwemer. Their increasing knowledge of the universe was a threat to her power. She aimed to destroy the Dwemer and prevent another renaissance from ever occurring that might reveal her (and other princes') weaknesses.

---
**Below is my understanding of the Dwemer Renaissance:**

* It is the time of the Dwemer, a race of elves spread across Tamriel. Their use of magic and technology is unparalleled. Magic is used to power mechanisms of great utility, machines of great force and automatons of innumerable uses. They exhibited the signs of renaissance that we saw in Europe. But soon, all that is going to come to an end by the hands of Azura.

* Dwemer power is centered on the amalgam of magic and science.  They examine the stars and they explore the earth.

* Their creations are both beautiful and perfect for both form and function.  Their architecture is unique.

* Their people are famous: Namely Kagrenac and his understanding of Lorkhan's heart has survived through history.

* Their exploration of both sky and earth leads them to the understanding of the heart of a god. It is a pinnacle of mortal understanding and they quickly begin work to learn how to tap its power to achieve an immortality of their own.

* Dwemer magic becomes so advanced they extract one of the tones of Padomay, an original god of pure essence.

The Dwemer are possibly the beginning of Tamriel's ultimate change from magic and agriculture to magic and industry.  Despite their aims, despite their morality and despite their search for immortality, their knowledge is spread through Tamriel.  

But, according to *Nerevar at Red Mountain*, Azura destroys the Dwemer. She is responsible for their elimination and their search for immortality dies with them as well as their knowledge.

---

**EDIT 2:** There are four distinct seasons of Morrowind history: Nerevar, Tribunal, Dagoth Ur, and Nerevarine.  Morrowind's renaissance existed during the time of Nerevar, continued under the Tribunal at the height of its power and even during the early years of Dagoth Ur's rise. At the time of the Nereverine, as many of you commented, the Tribunal's influence was already severely restricted by Dagoth Ur.

**EDIT 5:** So why would Azura want to devastate the Tribunal and destroy the Heart of Lorkhan? The answer is simple: The Tribunal are three self made gods, the epitome of what the Dwemer hoped to achieve en masse! The Tribunal had exceeded the Dwemer's understanding of the universe and knew her for what she truly was: a spiteful daedra of imperfect knowledge who was jealous of her power over mortals.  The existence of the Heart of Lorkhan was also a continued problem. It could still be used by the Tribunal to perfect and share their godhood.

**Below is my interpretation of the Morrowind and (implied) Imperial Renaissance:**

* It's a time of overall peace and Morrowind is protected by Vivec and the Tribunal.  It's a time when the competition between the Great Houses has created wealth and spread knowledge.  It is a time when the Cyrodilic empire is unified and its peace with Morrowind appears beneficial to both powers.  Azura waits, knowing that these self-made gods will eventually find a self-made enemy.

* There are great men such as Dyvath Fyr - an immensely old wizard and renaissance man.  There are scientists of the past such as Louis Beauchamp - who unfortunately had trouble with a crashed airship. These are just ones I've seen in-game, but they are examples that science and exploration continue to thrive.

* Leaders of the Great Houses have developed successful diplomatic ways to compete in a fairly non-violent way.

* Magical knowledge appears to be the strongest it's ever been - great spells have been formed by combining different spell types.  The tonal knowledge of Kagrenac is partially gone, but the Tribunal know enough to maintain their godliness.

* Weapons enchantments are powerful

* People can walk on water and fly.

**EDIT 6:** Dagoth Ur rises and taps the Heart of Lorkhan to become a god in his own right.  The Tribunal is prevented from accessing the Heart, but they still outnumber him and can contain his power for the time being. It appears there is a stalemate, but the gods have options they have not utilized yet.

But this all ends when Azura intervenes by convincing the Nerevarine that the Tribunal killed Nerevar to steal power. This is reinforced by Vivec's honesty and admittance that there are two stories of the events at Red Mountain. He generously allows the Nerevarine to decide for himself which events were true.  Unlike Azura, he offers truth and independence to the Nereverine.

Regardles, Dagoth Ur is clearly insane and must be stopped. 

The Nerevarine could have worked with the Tribunal to stop Dagoth Ur and separate him from the Heart while they restored their power. The stalemate could have continued or Dagoth could have weakened in the same way that the Tribunal could have! Oblivion knows that the Daedra have reached their own stalemates!

The Nerevarine destroys the Heart of Lorkhan and Dagoth Ur.  It ushers in the eventual destruction of Vvardenfall, the invasion by outside forces and the destruction of one of the Great Houses. 

The Nerevarine was a pawn to destroy the enlightenment of the mortal races. **EDIT 6 ENDS**

---

**Below is my interpretation of the beginning of the Cyrodelian Middle Ages.**

The Septim Bloodline produced some good and bad emperors.  But under the Septims,  the empire was unified and emperors like kateriah seem to have been adored by the people.  Despite a fairly good history, the knowledge of the Dwemer finally died with the Tribunal. Whatever knowledge Sotha Sil had tried to preserve died when Almalexia orchestrated his death.  At this point Dyvath Fyr and Yagram Bagarn are the only people old enough to have remaining Dwemer knowledge and they have disappeared.

* The Oblivion Crisis was a second assault on whatever was left of Tamriel's enlightenment and doomed the Cyrodilic Empire.  Mehrunes Dagon, Daedric Prince of destruction, uses the loss of Akatosh's protection over the empire as a sign that he should take every attempt at invading and conquering the land.

* The process destroyed towns and killed thousands.

* Magic, weapons, enchantments and alchemy lost its power, while many recipe and spell combinations became lost knowledge.  People could no longer fly.

* Were there any renaissance men/women during this time?

Thus the empire became incredibly weak.  Azura returns to her benign and kindly self as she watches Cyrodil burn.

----

**Below is my understanding of the continued decline of the Imperial and Nordic middle ages.**

Now we reach the time of Skyrim, the Dragons and the Dovahkiin.  What is left of the Empire suffers from civil war and a terribly one-sided truce with an enemy that rifles through internal affairs and employs the imperial army to stamp down religion.  And now, once again, powerful and immortal enemies have returned to destroy the world.

* The mage guild is gone.  The sole bastion of magic in Skyrim is the mages college, which stands precariously literally and figuratively.  Nords may do not have a love of magic, which is akin to a disregard for education and its benefits.  Perhaps in the past they relied on the Thu'um for all their magical needs. Its purity did not require them to educate themselves in the magical arts. Regardless, they celebrate their hardiness, violence and honor above their intellect, magical prowess and civility.

* There are few great renaissance men, Calcemo being the only one I can think of who has barely any interest in history or science.  Falion is an enigmatic conjurer who (it appears) continues to study magic on his own terms.  The men of note rely on violence as the tool of choice for solving all problems.

* Diplomacy has degraded.  The *real* renaissance formalized types of Diplomacy, which standardized modes of conduct to ensure safe discussion.  Ulfric killed high king Torygg when many believed he had not exhausted many of his diplomatic options.  His behavior is only restrained when he is forced by dragon issues to negotiate.

* Regardless of any success or failures by the empire or the stormcloaks, the emperor is assassinated.

* Dragons are destroying towns, those who are surviving do so by hiding.

* Magic is limited to even fewer spells, enchantments are weak, weapons of the previous eras are forgotten.

And that leaves us with another look at Azura again. She stands benignly seeking only to restore *Azura's Star* a soul stealing artifact.

----

And so there we have it; the end of what little renaissance there could have been. Begun by Azura against the Dwemer and then against the Tribunal and Morrowind and continued by those who took advantage of weakened mortals.

* Does Tamriel face a dark age soon?

* Is magic's power declining?

* What will mortals face in the future?

* What will Azura do next?

1357461958.0,81,self.teslore,161yk6,"The Elder Way, Hist Genetics, and Argonian reincarnation.",xenoposeidon,94,13,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/161yk6/the_elder_way_hist_genetics_and_argonian/,"This is very much a pretext to a larger thread I will be making later on, but I just wanted to get some theories and explanations out for you fine folks to take a gander at before bombarding you with complex Histy-stuff and the such.

The simplest way a common Argonian would explain to an Imperial interviewer as to what happens to an Argonian after death is that they are rejoined with the Hist and reincarnated into a new body. This has some truth in it, yes, but is very unspecific and does not contain the whole truth. To understand the full truth, one has to first understand Hist-altering, A.K.A the Elder Way.
In Lord of Souls, it is revealed that the Hist can “alter things.” More specifically, one case of their altering of “things” is them altering the Argonian physical composition to make Argonians much stronger, faster, and more intelligent when they needed the Argonians to be extra-efficient soldiers in the Oblivion Crisis. Glim specifically states that ““A few twelves of years ago, our country was invaded from Oblivion. The Hist knew it was going to happen, and called our people back to Black Marsh. Many of us were altered, made ready for the war that we had to fight. Made stronger, faster—able to endure terrible things. ...”
We also know that Hist Sap can also alter the Argonian physical state, as Hist sap transforms Argonians at childhood from small primitive lizards to tall humanoid lizards. The more Hist sap that is taken, the more humanoid the Argonian looks.

And finally we know Hist can alter themselves. The Lilmoth tree is described as gigantic and overreaching, and the Hist we see in Oblivion is not exactly gigantic and overreaching, yet all Hist are equal and look the same originally. We know Hist can alter things, and why not themselves? It seems only reasonable a Hist whose purpose is to give political advice would look fearsome and powerful, and that another who is cut away from its brothers would be frail and small. Another theory I have come up with is that Falinesti is in fact a Hist that has disconnected from the Hivemind, i.e gone “Rogue” in order to adapt for a changing environment and culture, and thus grew ways to move around and be favorable for the populace of Bosmer. 

Contrary to what one may think, Hist alterting is definitely not alteration magic. Neither is it magic at all, really. Hist altering is a technic of super-evolution older than any kind of magic or ascension. The Hist were in fact the first beings on Nirn, and had plenty of time to develop their ways. This technic is so old and complex a simple human or mer mind could not comprehend it, only a super advanced one, such as the mind of a Psijic monk.  

From [On Arteaum]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Daggerfall:Fragment:_On_Artaeum) we know that the first beings on Tamriel (The Hist) taught the Psijics the Elder Way, a way of changing the natural composition of things. This fits perfectly with the theory. So, from now on in this explanation I will refer to Hist Super-evolution-altering as The Elder Way.

I myself have a very limited understanding of Genetics, as one would expect from someone my age and educational grade, but I’m still going to do my best to use it in comparison. Where magic is based on Magicka, the Elder Way is based on something I can only identify as the Elder Scrolls counterpart of DNA or the genetic composition of different living things. In simplicity, the Elder Way is really a fancy term for purposeful mutation. If a Hist such as the Lilmoth tree wants to look more fearsome and gigantic, it simply has to use its hyper-intelligence to think its nucleotide sequence into changing around, composing a new sequence that would allow for the genomes to develop differently, and the result would be a larger Hist. There you have it, I just terribly explained mutation. Anyways the same works for Hist Sap ingestion. 
Think of the Hist and Argonians as computers and sap as a flash drive. The Hist set a certain blueprint for Elder Way Mutation in the sap, basically like data, shed the sap, and the sap is then taken and willfully ingested by the young Argonian. Then this data is transferred, and the sap runs the data like a program, mutating the Argonian. The more sap is ingested, the more data can be transferred and the program or mutation can run more effectively.
The reason ingestion has to be done over and over again and that Argonians are not born like their parents is because Argonians are unable to ejaculate part of the sap to their egg spawns and thus transfer the program nor can they themselves alter the child because they cannot comprehend the Elder Way.

The neat thing is that through seeing that the Hist were able to mutate Argonians from afar at the time of the Oblivion Crisis we can see that the Hist can actually transmit data to the Sap from far away. Think of this kind of like Elder Way mutation internet or cloud data. From this we can hypothesize on what happens when argonians die.

Let’s get an example going. Say we have an Argonian, we’ll call him Jeelus from the Agaceph tribe. When Jeelus turned 1 year old, his dad Zeeril took him to ingest some sap and get named. Jeelus happily did his duty as an Argonian and ingested some sap from the local village tree. Once he did, the sap took control of his body and used the Elder Way to turn him into a nice, tall, handsome young Argonian. Now let’s say Mr. Jeelus grows up and works with the East Empire Company, and on one of his trips suddenly falls overboard from his ship and gets eaten by a Sea Drake. Once the jaws of death sink on him and his brain stops functioning, the sap mutation program realizes the Argonian died, and thus gathers all the info on how to mutate an Argonian to look and be as strong as Jeelus, making it into, you guessed it, blue prints! It sends those blue prints back to the Hist, who then takes those blue prints and puts them into yet another sap flash drive to insert into yet another newborn Argonian, who is by chance the nephew of Jeelus. Jeelus’s nephew then grows up to look and be as strong as Jeelus. The nephew’s dad, Jeelus’s egg mate, looks at his newly ingested son and exclaims, “Xuth! My boy sure does look like his uncle Jeelus. I bet he is a reinacarnation of him!” and thus the cycle completes itself and that is how Argonian reincarnation works.

Since this process is so successful, and “reincarnation” is so common, death is viewed as a major part of Argonian culture, which is also why many Argonians have a belief in Sithis. Sadly, though, it is not Sithis that causes the reincarnation but rather the manipulative Hist.

I hope that was not too complex. I tried to do it in ELI5 format, so I hope this theory is well understood by you guys. If you folks are interested do stay tuned for later posts, I am starting what I think may be a series of these theory threads, so keep your eyes out for new ones.

That is all. See you tomorrow in the Community Thread.

1351608804.0,77,self.teslore,12c8kv,"Of Blades, myths, and prophecy",,89,12,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12c8kv/of_blades_myths_and_prophecy/,"Well, today, October 30th, is quite the somber day in the TES universe. You see, the calendar of the TES universe has today being the 30th of the month of Frostfall. That day, the 30th of Frostfall, 4E 171, marks the opening of the first Great War between the Second Aldmeri Dominion and the Third Cyrodillic Empire. We all know the events of the Great War: on that day, the Thalmor made the first Great Purge against the Blades, and, upon the rejection of their terms by Titus Mede II, they began their lightning attacks using the combined forces of the Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajiit. That much is very common knowledge. This post would be pretty useless if I was just going to talk about the Great War. This post, then, is going to focus on the history and role of the Blades. I'm likely going to be telling you what you already know, if you've looked around about information on the Blades before now, but I feel they're a topic worthy of discussion, so why not have all the relevant information in one place? Anyway, on with the show.

To start, we need to go back to the beginning. The Blades came to be through the Akaviri Dragonguard. They were proclaimed to be dragonslayers, but as they hunted down the remaining dragons in Tamriel after they invaded in the late years of the First Era, the need for their services declined. They cemented themselves into Tamriel's history by becoming the protectors and sworn agents of Reman Cyrodiil, who was Dragonborn. Reman, as you all know, founded the Second Cyrodiilic Empire. He halted the invasion of Tamriel by combined forces of Tscaesci and the Men of Akavir by defeating them dramatically at Pale Pass. Historically, we're told that the Men of Akavir, the Dragonguard in particular, bowed to him, apologizing profusely and telling him that they were looking for him. It's implied that his Thu'um quelled the invading forces, and the Dragonguard recognized the sound from the dragons they hunted in Akavir. The Dragonguard was not a new thing, though, when the invasion of Tamriel came into the history books. They had protected the emperors and leaders of the Tscaesci from the threats of the Dragons native to Akavir since time immemorial.

However, we're told that the Men of Akavir were ""eaten"" by the Tscaesci, who, we are also told, are immortal, vampiric Serpent-Men. If taken literally, the Dragonguard survived due to the service they rendered to the nobility of the Snakemen (which I'll be using from now on because it's easier to type), but I doubt that a literal interpretation is necessary at all. Much of Akavir is told to us in mythic and allegorical terms, which prompts a closer examination of the facts. I promise we'll get to the Blades again soon, so just bear with. If the Tscaesci truly ate the Men of Akavir, there wouldn't be any reports of them being on Tamriel, and yet, there are. So, either the reports are wrong, or the term ""ate"" is allegorical, as is common with Akavir. I'm going to go with the latter.

Now then, there are records of the Men of Akavir being on Tamriel. Marriages with Akaviri men and women were considered very good for one's reputation in the new Empire, and there were towns that, at least until close to the end of the First Era, were pure-blood Akaviri settlements. Whether or not that means only the men or only the Snakemen, or a mixture of the two was present, but I find it hard to believe that the race of Men from Akavir was completely wiped out, at least globally. The biggest example of that is, in fact, the Dragonguard. They are recorded as pledging themselves to Reman I, and they left their mark on Tamriel quite notably. Sky Haven, Scour Wind, Storm Talon, and most famously, Cloud Ruler Temple are all wonderful examples of the Dragonguard's Akaviri origins. So, we can assume the Men of Akavir intermingled with the Tamrielans as their influence spread. As their influence spread, and they protected the Dragonborn emperors as they had protected the Tscaesci emperors before, they expanded their network of agents and safehouses, laying the groundwork for the systems of spies and secrets that the Blades would eventually employ to great effect.

Now that that history lesson is over with, let's move into more recent times. It's not specifically stated (to my knowledge) when the Dragonguard became the Blades, but presumably it was sometime in the Second Era, since we have record of the Dragonguard's annals from Sky Haven dating to [2E 568](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/annals-dragonguard). In any event, at some point during the Second Era, the Dragonguard became the Blades. It likely had some relation to the formation of the Fighters Guild, since some Akaviri from the Dragonguard would likely have been recruited for the initially-Akaviri-only group, though it could simply have been Tiber Septim reestablishing an order to protect him after losing his Thu'um. The history of the order descends into the murky depths for about six hundred years, then reemerges as the Blades in the Third Era.

The Blades under Tiber Septim were his finest soldiers, as well as his staunch protectors. When the Numidium was destroyed, they made it one of their primary missions to reassemble it. That arc of their story actually doesn't even end for some four hundred years, when the events of *Daggerfall* take place. As fighters, the were easily distinguished by their ceremonial armor of heavy steel, in traditional Akaviri Dragonguard style, complete with their curved longswords. Their training style is brutal, intense, and very efficient; on-edge sparring is the name of the game, and appears to have been for a very long time, as evidenced by their interactions with each other in both *Oblivion* and *Skyrim*. Their network of spies and agents is vast, which we see in both in *Morrowind* and *Oblivion*. To quote [The Rise and Fall of the Blades](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/rise-and-fall-blades), the Emperor's elite agents and protectors were ""just the tip of the spear, for the Blades were a larger organization, stretching to every corner of Tamriel. These agents were of every race. They were merchants, thieves, craftsman, mages, and warriors, all acting as spies, protecting the Empire as needed, and operating in secret. They often acted alone, but some fragments speak of them meeting in secret fortresses across the continent.""

In fact, were it not for the Blades, the heroes of the first three games in the main series wouldn't have had a chance to do their work. The Blades ferreted out secrets, and sent their agents, both knowingly, and unknowingly in the case of the Nerevarine, in to make decisive actions to save parts of, or the whole of the Empire. The worked alongside the Champion of Cyrodiil during the Oblivion Crisis, though a bit less willingly, and helped to achieve the final end of it. However, they failed in their primary mission, as they had before, and this time, they were left without a Dragonborn to guide them, something that hadn't happened since the end of the First Era. In fact, it was far easier for the Dragonguard, at the end of the First Era, to adjust to protecting their Tscaesci Potentates than it was for the Blades, at the end of the Third Era, to adjust to having no one to protect.

By the time the Fourth Era rolled around, the Blades were reeling at their failure, and were effectively leaderless until Titus Mede I. They managed to hang together through their strict order, but an ancient enemy would soon rear its head up. As protectors of the Empire, they warred with the first Aldmeri Dominion as the Dragonguard, and the coming of the second signaled trouble. The Blades were the first to identify the nature of the threat the Thalmor posed, and it's fair to say that their efforts through the years leading up to the Great War may have saved the Empire from utter destruction in the initial strikes. However, those moves came at a heavy price. Most, if not all, of the Blades agents scattered throughout the Aldmeri Dominion's territory were killed in a purge on the 30th of Frostfall, in the year 171 of the Fourth Era. From then on, the Thalmor would perform even more purges, killing resistance fighters backed by the Blades, as well as more agents themselves. It's presumed that every stronghold of the Blades was either destroyed, or buried by the Blades in an attempt to keep their secrets safe from the Thalmor, except for Sky Haven, which had apparently been lost at some point after the Second Era, perhaps when the Dragonguard fell out of history.

The last few Blades we know of made it out of the Imperial Province, [likely on orders from the Emperor](/g), and went deep underground. The Thalmor continued to hunt them even after the war ended, for the White-Gold Concordat gave them the power to do so. Of the pre-War Blades, only two are confirmed to be alive, and [one other](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fultheim) who may or may not be a Blade in hiding. The Dragonborn, of course, has the option of rebuilding, or at least, beginning to rebuild the Blades in *Skyrim*.

So now, we come to the end of our information on the Blades. I want to talk a bit about their future, which, ironically, means we need to go back into their past.

An ancient Akaviri prophecy (some attribute it to an Elder Scroll, but I give it to the Akaviri) was made concerning dragons, and the Last Dragonborn. It was this prophecy that caused the Dragonguard to leave Akavir in search of one of the Dragonborn, and this prophecy that bade them to pledge their loyalty to all Dragonborn through Reman I. It was this prophecy in particular they chose to set in stone in Sky Haven Temple, sealed behind a Blood Seal only one with Dovah Sos could open. I'm fairly sure you all know it, but it is quite fun to say, so forgive me for posting it again:

""When misrule takes its place at the eight corners of the world

When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped

When the thrice-blessed fail and the Red Tower trembles

When the Dragonborn Ruler loses his throne, and the White Tower falls

When the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding

The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn""

The Dragonguard was so moved by this prophecy that they sought out the one called Dragonborn, wishing to stand at his side and do their part to stop the World-Eater should he awake. Their constant vigilance and protection of those who have been Dragonborn from Reman onwards was not simply due to Reman defeating them in battle. They pledged themselves to him because they needed to wait for the day the World-Eater awoke. They needed to be there alongside the Last Dragonborn for the final battle, so much so that that mission remained at the heart of their group through four Eras. It's not surprising, then, that their mission prompted Delphine to reveal herself to the Dovahkiin, or that she and Esbern helped the Dovahkiin. Neither, considering their origins, is it surprising that Delphine and Esbern asked the Dovahkiin to kill Paarthurnax. But what does the future hold? After all, Alduin was defeated and sent, presumably, out of existence to await his rebirth at the end of the kalpa.

Let's start with the simple things. The Blades were staunchly opposed to the Thalmor before the events of *Skyrim*. Now, they must be hell-bent on eradicating them, once they're finished with the Dragons, that is. They will likely be key players in future installments of the main series, perhaps sparking rebellions, perhaps openly fighting in a second Great War. They will, presumably, guard the Dovahkiin until he/she dies, at which time they can decide on a new purpose, for their old one is fulfilled. The World-Eater was stopped by the Last Dragonborn, and their ancestors' mission is finally complete. The future of the Blades is wide open, and with their history as master spies, they could prove the key to the downfall of the Thalmor, and the salvation of the entire Mundus. They don't even have their traditional role as the protectors of the Emperor anymore, now that the Penitus Oculatus has taken their place. With Delphine as the acting Grandmaster of the Blades, and an independent and angry Skyrim, it seems the tides may have turned.

So, hopefully on this 30th of Frostfall, you take the time to stop and appreciate Tamriel's now-resident dragonslayers, and the loses they suffered for the good of Tamriel, Nirn, and all mortal-kind. After all, they were not hunting, but were looking for the One to stand against the World-Eater. Theirs is a deep and storied past, bound up in prophecy and legend, as old as the dragons themselves. We may not ever see Akavir with our own eyes in a TES game, but when you look at the legacy of the Blades, and the mark they have made throughout Nirn's history, we get a small glimpse into the region I think most, if not all, of us want to see very desperately. Hopefully this will give you a better appreciation of the role the Blades play as you play through the Elder Scrolls games. It is quite a different experience, playing with all this in the back of your mind. If you want to read more about Akavir, [this page](http://imperial-library.info/content/guide-akavir#2702) is excellent as a starting point.

*By Harman Maurus*

**Introduction**

From the central province of Cyrodiil, one may cast a stone in any direction and have it land on something worthy of study (assuming one’s arm is strong enough), but for too long the Empire’s scholars and learned men have been entirely too illiberal in their casting of inquisitive stones. Climb the highest peaks of Skingrad or Kvatch and look south. Look over the rugged hills and sloping pastures of old Colovia, over the shimmering Strid and into the vast expanse of green. From here you see the south-western province of Valenwood, tumbling southwards under a covering of lush vegetation. It is from here I cast my stone.

**“The Wild Remain”: Valenwood**

When the Imperial Geographical Society published the first Pocket Guide to the Empire in 2E 864, Valenwood was an almost begrudged footnote in “The Aldmeri Dominion”, the land and its people serving as little more than comic relief after the grim accusations made against the Altmer. Certainly such works were a product of their time – suspicion of the elves was a fact of life in the early days of Tiber Septim’s rule, and while the rampant racism and misinformation that characterised the first publication had been shed by the publication of the third Guide in 3E 432, Valenwood was described under the title above.

This somewhat dismissive description, heavy with the implication that Valenwood is more wilderness than a province, something to “remain” once the rest of the map is filled, is demonstrative of the attitudes that have left Valenwood so neglected as an area of study. However, it is perhaps a fair comment on one level. After all, respect for and protection of nature is the central tenet of the Bosmeri religion, and so they have no desire to change the beautiful face of Valenwood. 

The vast majority of the Bosmeri province is untamed and unspoiled. For the most part Valenwood is a sea of rolling hills, thickly covered with trees that put the mightiest of the Great Forest to shame, but there is a great degree of variety, with dense jungles, airy woods, dark mangroves and swamps, and wide isolated plains. Throughout the province, a network of rivers and natural canals provide the main means of transporting goods and travels. Rather extensive roads and infrastructure were introduced to the forest by the first Aldmeri Dominion, but the Bosmer have neither the desire nor the ability to maintain these roads, and so they are overgrown and broken down where they are visible at all.

Valenwood’s settlements are testament to the Bosmeri love for the unique and beautiful; no two are alike to the sympathetic eye. While it is perhaps most logical to construct them on the sunny banks of Valenwood’s many waterways, the intrepid adventurer may be surprised at where self-sufficient Bosmer settlements may be found, such is their love for the deep, hidden places of the forest. For the most are small and unobtrusive – clanhouses or villages built from imported timber, loose stone, hide yurts, or sometimes magically-cultivated treehouses, sustained by the clan’s hunters and fishermer and by what trade comes through their corner of the forest. There are Bosmer towns and cities, however, and they are some of the most spectacular on the continent.

Most famous is Falinesti, the ancient royal capital of Valenwood. This is a city unlike any other, nestled in the higher branches of one of the mightiest trees in Tamriel, largest of Valenwood’s migratory graht-oaks reaching more than a mile into the sky. The settlement itself is, in the grand scheme of the tree’s existence, unobtrusive. A complex network of walkways and platforms connect the broad, twisting branches of the tree, dwellings constructed from living wood and moss, tanned hide and great animal bones. The most popular method of accessing the soaring boughs of Falinesti is by small platforms known as “lifts”, attached to strong vines and manned with pulleys by local Bosmer, Imga or Orcs (of which there is a surprisingly large population in Valenwood, particularly Falinesti – the Bosmer are a traditionally welcoming people).

Once long ago, the Falinesti tree was an even more fantastical sight as it, like the lesser graht-oaks, would migrate across Valenwood, spending the winters in the north of the province, and moving south for the summer. The great tree rooted itself in the winter of 3E 429, much to the shock of the Bosmer, and the rooting was the high point of a time of great upheaval in the province. Many hoped that the phenomenon would be temporary, that the tree would resume its migration in the next season, then the next year and so on, until it eventually became apparent that Falinesti was to remain stationary for the foreseeable future. 

The famous peculiarity of Falinesti should not be allowed to detract from the beauty and value of Valenwood’s other great cities, however. There is Elden Root, one of the most ancient elven cities on mainland Tamriel, a monumental construction of once-white stone which the years have blended almost seamlessly into the surrounding vegetation. It rests in the centre of the sacred “clearing” (relative to the density of the surrounding trees) known as the Elden Grove, and has served as Valenwood’s capital under both Aldmeri Dominions. There is perhaps good reason for this: the ancient city is far more logical and efficient in its construction than any more “modern” Bosmeri city, exhibiting the strong, considered design of Aldmeri cities. It is also the major destination for migrants to the province, hosting large communities of Altmer and (traditionally) men.

On the edge of the Elden Grove lies the city of Silvenar, the flower of Valenwood. Once a vibrant glade, the city is the result of a gradual phenomenon of self-petrification by the trees. It is uncertain exactly how this came about, whether naturally or magically, but the flowering trees began to produce copious brilliant sap that over time hardened and crystallised into dazzling amber of a hundred colours. On a logistical level, Silvenar is the polar opposite of neighbouring Elden Root; its streets are a maze of petrified branches, petals and waves of sap that look almost as if they are still flowing. Its buildings are irregular bubbles and canopies of glistening sap, many of them rendered exceptionally beautiful by the shapes of the ancient trees. This city, while it has never been the province’s capital, is arguably the true centre of power in Valenwood, for it is here that the Silvenar resides. The Silvenar is too complex a subject to be appended to this section, and will be discussed later in this work, but let it to suffice to say, his (or their) presence in the city makes it an important destination for many travellers of all kinds, and this, along with the city’s long tradition of fine crafts and smithing, ensure that Silvenar is one of the wealthiest cities in the province.

Valenwood’s fourth great city is the port of Haven, an ancient port in the south-east that exploded into prominence under the Cyrodiilic Empire in 1E 2714. While architecturally less unique than Falinesti or Silvenar, constructed predominantly from the plentiful timber imports or hewn from the cliff-face, Haven is nonetheless a sight to behold. The busiest port in the province, it is naturally filled with activity – merchants, travellers, pirates, fishermen and all manner of seafarer. If it were not for the trees, and the bizarre and uncommon Bosmeri shipyards, Haven could almost be in Hammerfell or Colovia. 


**Elves of Valenwood: The Bosmer**

The Bosmer, Boiche, or Wood Elves are the people of Valenwood, in all senses. For the most part, they live in simple obscurity, existing in harmony with the forest and without great regard for the politics, wars and intrigues so beloved by most of Tamriel’s inhabitants. 

The Bosmer are naturally well-equipped to thrive in Valenwood. The average male Bosmer standing a little shorter than a man at about five and a quarter feet, and this diminutive stature is invaluable in navigating their densely-wooded homeland. In a similar vein, the Bosmer are faster and more agile than any man or mer, and possess an uncanny dexterity and nimbleness, making them excellent craftsmer, woodsmer and most famously, archers.

In their appearance, Bosmer are perhaps less striking to the human eye than the Altmer or Dunmer, lacking as they do the gold or ashen skin of their cousins, and having significantly less pronounced elven features – their faces wider, their cheekbones rounder, their brows lower. Common tradition (as well-supported by evidence as we may expect for such matters) has it that the early Bosmer were known for mingling with their Nedic neighbours, or “taking mannish wives” as the Altmer creation myth has it, and it is reasonable to assume that it is as a result of this intermixing that the Bosmer are so (comparatively) human in their appearance. 

In one respect, however, the face of a Bosmer is even more striking than that of an Altmer or Dunmer. While there exists, as with any race, a great variety of eye colours and shades, among the Bosmer the most common is pure black, with no visible whites or iris. This phenomenon occurs rarely in the Altmer, and more rarely still in the Dunmer, but in the Bosmer it is common and iconic, though the reason for this is unknown, with theories ranging from Y’ffre’s gift to archers, to a by-product of their mixed ancestry to the last vestige of the mythical time before Bosmer believe Y’ffre taught them their shape. The truth of the matter will perhaps never be known; certainly no Bosmer with whom I have conversed has been able to give a definitive answer, preferring the old Bosmeri adage, “one mer’s miracle is another mer’s accident”.


**Y’ffre’s Favoured People: The Bosmeri religion**

Over the course of their time in Valenwood, the Bosmer have developed a faith surprisingly distinct from that of their Aldmeri forebears. Auri-El retains his position as the God of time and ultimate head of the pantheon, with Lorkhan as his chief opponent, the Trickster. Mara, Xarxes and Stendarr also remain in their respective roles as gods of  (broadly speaking) love, knowledge and mercy respectively. However, the Bosmer have shed several important gods and ancestor deities still revered by the Altmer; Magnus, Trinimac, Syrabane and Phynaster have all vanished completely from worship. In their place, the Bosmer have adopted several deities from the surrounding cultures, perhaps unsurprising given the far more open society of the Bosmer. 

From Tamriel’s men the Bosmer have received Arkay, the “mortals’ god”. For the Bosmer he is a god of seasons more than anything else, a significant role for the nature-loving Bosmer. Herma-Mora has come to the Bosmer in his Nordic role as an obstacle and danger, and Z’en, an aspect of Zenithar, is believed to have been brought to Valenwood by Kothringi sailors. Z’en was a god of agriculture for the Kothringi, but the Bosmer have little use for such a god, and so he has become a broader and more powerful god of toil and payment in kind. The God of Toil faded somewhat into obscurity after the Knahaten Flu, possibly due to the extinction of the Kothringi with whom his worshippers were often connected.

Perhaps most surprisingly, the Bosmer have adopted several deities from their traditional enemies (and mythological cousins), the Khajiit. The Moon Gods, Jone and Jode, are central parts of the Khajiiti faith, largely due to the Lunar Lattice that governs their shape. How they came to appear in the Bosmeri pantheon is a mystery to modern scholars; some argue that the Bosmer pragmatically adopted the gods of their foes after one too many defeats, others believe the Bosmeri love of the natural world organically extended to include the moons, which of course exert a considerable influence on Mundus. In a similar vein, the Bandit God, Baan Dar, who appears as a marginal trickster spirit in many religions, has surfaced as a significant deity among the Bosmer. To the Khajiit, Baan Dar represents the innovation and desperate genius of their oppressed people, with most stories having him save his followers at the last minute from the predations of men or (more commonly) elves. It is interesting, then, that the Bosmer, so often the villains in the Khajiiti Baan Dar’s tales, should revere him in a similar way, although of course in Bosmeri tales he is most often on the side of the beset Boiche.

This exchange of deities, however, pales to insignificance when compared to the key hallmark of the Bosmeri faith, that is the role of Y’ffre, the Forest God. In the Aldmeri faith, and most of its descendants, Y’ffre is a relatively minor god of the forest, song and the water, who taught birds to sing at the dawn of time. In the Imperial tradition, Y’ffre is not worshipped, but thought of as one of the first Earthbones, gods who put their entire beings into laying down the natural laws of Mundus. For the Bosmer, his importance is far greater.

The first mortals, says the Bosmeri creation myth, did not know their proper shapes; they changed from man to elf to beast to plant and back again, never able to settle in their true forms. Y’ffre pitied the mortals and showed them their true shapes, making man always man, elf always elf, beast always beast, and plant always plant. Now that they had their proper shapes, mortals could begin to understand the world. 

For the Bosmer, he went further still; they were his favoured people. The Bosmer call Y’ffre “The Storyteller”, for the secrets he taught them in the early days of Mundus, secrets ranging from the beautiful songs of the forest, to the fearsome Wild Hunt. But this sharing of secrets was not given without payment in kind. Y’ffre loved the forest he had helped to create (and it loved him; legends say the very trees moved closer to hear his songs), and new that he, like all the gods, could not remain to protect it indefinitely. To this end he tasked the Bosmer, his favourite people and best students, with protecting the natural order of things, and his sacred forest of Valenwood. In exchange he would make it their home forever, and bestow upon them all of his choicest gifts.

This mythical agreement is known as the Green Pact, and remains the highest code of the Bosmeri faith and society, having a visible impact on every aspect of life in Valenwood. The exact terms of the Green Pact are not readily discussed with outsiders, and so many conflicting accounts exist. Generally speaking, however, the Bosmer are forbidden from harming any plant life, from the mightiest tree to the smallest weed. The felling of trees by anyone is a crime against the Bosmeri religion. 

One of Y’ffre’s most dangerous secrets was the Wild Hunt. He taught the Bosmer how to undo his first great work and return to the dawn time when elves were beasts and men and plants all at once. In times of great need – typically in case of invasion and war – groups of Bosmer may choose to carry out the ancient and highly secretive ritual to permanently transform themselves into primordial beasts. The Hunt typically manages to direct itself towards the enemy and throw itself against them with a fury rare in the most ferocious beasts. There is no way to undo this terrible transformation, say the Bosmer – those that go wild do not return. Usually, when the Hunt has overrun the enemies of the Bosmer, the changed ones turn on each other, ripping each other apart in what is reportedly the most horrifying stage of the process. Those that survive go on to haunt the dark places of Valenwood as ageless monstrosities, the most famous examples being Willy the Bitten and King Dead-Wolf Deer.

The Bosmer are not proud of this ability, and typically refuse to speak of it with outsiders. Indeed, it is seen as an ultimate last resort, for when desperate measures must be taken to defend Valenwood and the Bosmer. Certainly the sacrifices are great.

The Meat Mandate, seen by some as a separate agreement, and others as a “clause” of the Green Pact, forbids the consumption of plant matter, even naturally fallen fruit, and, most shockingly to outsiders, obligates the Bosmer to consume in entirety any fallen enemy, with the help of only his or her family. The Bosmer then, are not only religiously carnivorous, but religiously cannibalistic; they will happily eat any natural being (although daedra and the undead appear to be exceptions to the Meat Mandate), regardless of its sentience or other qualities. Men, elves and beastfolk are all acceptable foodstuffs to the Bosmer. It is important to note, however, that once again precise details are somewhat scarce. Certain cultural practices seem to suggest that the flesh of fallen foes (as well as parts generally considered inedible) may be kept, or given as gifts even outside of the immediate family. It could well be that the Bosmeri understanding of “family” is too different from our own to be translate properly, and that it can therefore refer to one’s clan, tribe, or even race. 

In the late Third Era, a Bosmeri prophet known only as the “Precursor” rose to prominence. He foretold the return of Y’ffre, with new gifts for his favoured people, and this promise has since become ingrained in the Bosmeri faith. What exactly it means is completely unknown to Imperial scholars and even, it would appear, to the Bosmer themselves, but the Precursor’s teachings have presented the first significant shift in the Bosmeri religion since the adoption of Z’en in the First or Second Era.


**The Tree-Sap People: Bosmeri Society**

Understandably, the Green Pact can pose many unusual problems for the Bosmer. Most societies take for granted the availability of wood for building and crafts, and numerous plants for food, fabric, paper, and countless other purposes, as well as the ability to cut down troublesome greenery to build or expand roads and settlements. The (in)famous Second Era scholar, Eric of Guis, scathingly described the Bosmer as “improvident”, but little could be further from the truth. The Bosmer have Green Pact alternatives for almost every use of wood and plant matter: plant fabrics are replaced by leather and silk, wood with bone, imported timber, or stone, alcoholic beverages are brewed from milk and meat, even pipes can be filled with crushed insects and animal fats. 

The history of Bosmeri society has in some ways been a long list of innovations to follow the Green Pact, which they follow to the letter but no further. But there is of course far more to it than that. Bosmeri society and culture differ significantly from the Aldmeri traditions kept alive in Alinor, with the Bosmer having shed most of the formality and ceremony from daily life. Unlike the Altmer, the Bosmer have little concern for their place in society or the wider world, preferring to live in simple harmony with the forest, carrying out their trade and enjoying their lives. To an extent, the Boiche consider themselves “liberated” and are prone to unbridled revelry and debauchery. One great difference between the Altmer and Bosmer is the willingness of the latter to intermingle, even interbreed, with men, and those of “impure” blood. The Altmeri Monomyth accuses the Bosmer of “soiling time’s line by taking mannish wives”, and certainly most Bosmer will not deny the human streaks in their lineage.

This generally relaxed attitude extends into many areas of Bosmeri culture. In battle, for instance, the Bosmer show no interest in “glory” or “honour” as defined by most races of men and mer. They will not hesitate to exploit any method of self-preservation, and are infamous for desertion and poor discipline. For a time Bosmeri archers, the finest in Tamriel, were employed in the armies of Colovia, but they were too unreliable for the Cyrodiilic warlords, prone to vanishing into the nearest copse or brush when in danger.  For this reason, the Bosmer are often admonished by other cultures for being cowardly or underhand, but such criticisms rarely seem to have any effect. The Boiche see no shame in putting survival first; their greatest epic poem is entitled the “Meh Ayleidoon”, “The One-Thousand Benefits of Hiding”.

Within Valenwood, Bosmer society is largely divided into various clans, tribes, and familial groups. Traditionally, it is to these that an individual Bosmer owes most pride and allegiance, and at various times tribes have gone to war with each other. Eplear was ever truly able to unify these disparate clans under one banner, and even this banner has lost much of its prestige without its original bearer. 

This familial and insular lifestyle means that most traditional Bosmeri settlements are small and isolated - sometimes no more than a single building. These settlements will be largely self-sufficient, feeding themselves through hunting and fishing, and acquiring any essentials the forest doesn’t provide from the nearest settlement that does, or else from the riverboats which sail back and forth across the province. 

Bosmeri society is almost totally lacking in rigid structures or expectations, and many outside observers are shocked to find the number of Bosmer with no apparent “job” or “occupation”. In the clanhouses and villages in particular, there are Bosmer who appear to carry out no predetermined function, instead roaming the forest at random or engaging in whatever task catches their interest. For the most part, a wilderness Bosmer’s main daily task will be hunting for his clan or family, but there is always time for some creative pursuit, or even to simply lie in the forest. In the cities, of course, more defined roles are necessary in order to succeed. There Bosmer act as shopkeepers, publicans, “builders”, musicians, butchers, and most any other jobs one might find in an Imperial or Altmeri city. Jobs of particular value include tanners, leatherworkers, craftsmer, bowyers and fletchers, as it is they who produce Valenwood’s most valuable exports. 

Leather is essential for the Bosmer, fulfilling a multitude of roles in compliance with the Green Pact - everything from clothes to building materials. Naturally, the Bosmer have, as a result, become quite skilled in its manufacture and use, and so Bosmeri leather and leather products can fetch high prices in foreign markets. Bows and arrows are similarly paramount in Bosmeri culture. The Boiche are renowned for their archery, and even credited with the invention of the bow, and so it is perhaps understandable that Tamriel’s archers pay highly for Valenwood bows. The Green Pact means that Bosmeri bows and arrows are typically made from bone or chitin, but may also be crafted from imported wood.

The dextrous and imaginative elves have also shown themselves to be talented craftsmer. Their love of the beautiful and the unique produces a great many unique artefacts, as well as traditional Bosmeri crafts: beads of shell, bone, pearls and beaks, talismans made from mages’ knucklebones, bone pipes and carvings, and innumerable others. 

Besides their hands, the Bosmer use their minds and mouths to great creative effect. Y’ffre is, as well as the God of the Forest, the Storyteller, and a patron of bards, and his people have a long tradition of poetry, song and performance. Epic poems like the Meh Ayleidion, the Mnoriad Pley Bar, the Dansir Goland and the Dirith Yalmillhiad are the milestones of Bosmeri culture, describing key events, myths and legends of the Bosmer from the Merethic Era onwards. These works provide another interesting contrast with the Altmer, whose cultural treasures include songs, paintings and tapestries to be experienced and sampled rarely and with refined tastes. The Bosmeri poems, on the other hand, are sung, told aloud, or performed by actors on a regular basis for the entertainment of the clan. Bosmeri villages and clanhouses will typically be alive with song and laughter, and in the cities impressive displays and festivals are common.

Outside of Valenwood, the Boiche are known (especially by their fellow mer) for various cultural “eccentricities”. Unlike the famously insular, some would say xenophobic, Altmer and Dunmer, the Bosmer are welcoming in the extreme, or were until the closure of Valenwood’s borders by the Dominion. Traditionally, it was not uncommon to see all manner of foreigners – men, mer, even Orcs – living alongside the Bosmer in their cities.

There was a thread on the forums that was able to connect the dots and show us how these daedra are related to each other and more importantly, Lorkhan. Each Daedra has experienced a shift in sphere since their creation.

**Trinimac to Malacath** – Nobility to Scorn.

**Jyggalag to Sheogorath** – Order to Chaos.

**LDK to Dagon** – Escaping destruction to causing destruction.

**Ruddy Man to Molag Bal** – Love to Hate.

Trinimac was the strong god of the Aldmer, he was noble, he was the one who sundered Lorkhan, and he was changed by Boethiah into Malacath for speaking lies of Lorkhan. 

Jyggalag was the Daedric prince of order until the other Daedra cursed him with the madness of Lorkhan, which is why Sheogorath is described as being born when the divine spark of Lorkhan was removed, and why he is called the “Sithis shaped hole” in the world.

The Leaper Demon King tried to extend every Kalpa at the end, and thanks to the schemes of The Greedy Man (Lorkhan) he was cursed by Alduin to become Mehrunes Dagon, the Daedra of destruction.

Now this is the tricky part, I have no evidence that it was the Ruddy Man persona that new love, but Molag Bal is the one who taught Vivec CHIM, and as such must have known love himself, and we have this little passage from the Aldudagga 

&gt; “You silly little snow whale, do you not know that there can be no joy for me? That long ago I gave up such things to the betterment of my rage? And while I recognize love between creatures that are unalike, I have built a bulwark against its joy and--"" 

Which suggests a shift in sphere, that once Bal knew love, but abandoned it for his rage. And what does this have to do with Lorkhan?

&gt; ""Mighty Lion of Evening, Vulgar and Low, Keeper of Coldharbour since the fall of Lyg, Destroyer of the Hearts of Men, I have come to-- “

Now what is Lyg you ask? From the Commentaries:

&gt; I give my soul to the Magna Ge, sayeth the joyous in Paradise, for they created Mehrunes the Razor in secret, in the very bowels of Lyg, the domain of the Upstart who vanishes. 

Lyg, Domain of the upstart who vanishes A.K.A Lorkhan. The wording in the Aldudagga suggests that Bal only became the master of the Coldharbour when Lyg fell in the previous Kalpa. 

If Auri-El is the soul of Anu-El who is the soul of Anu who is Stasis, it would stand to reason that Lorkhan is the soul of Sithis who is the soul of Padomay who is change.

Trying to hide from the outside world, they retreat into caves and abandoned, subterranean ruins where they attempt to reestablish some semblance of society.  The Dragonborn then comes and, ruin-by-ruin and cave-by-cave, tries to cut through the burgeoning society they have created in order to get to treasure they have inadvertently or advertently built their new cities and villages on.  

In the Forgotten Vale, they seem to have finally found a secluded and safe place to live.  There, they manage to build a sophisticated society on the cliff faces and in the caves.

In ruins, you can see that they have created a sophisticated society and show signs of understanding alchemy and enchanting.  They are able to raise livestock and smith weapons and armor.  

Are they insane, or are they just understandably very paranoid of outsiders?  They get along fine with each other and understand cooperative living and battle tactics.  The only thing to indicate that their minds have been lost is the fact that they attack outsiders on sight.  But is that really so surprising?

1355733811.0,78,self.teslore,14zif3,"The Unburning Flames: Proper Use of Pyromancy
",Ishullanu,79,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14zif3/the_unburning_flames_proper_use_of_pyromancy/,"  It is often said, by those with little to no experience in the field, that destruction is the most brutish form of magical expression. These uniformed critics claim it to be without subtlety, a release of un-tempered power requiring only base involvement of ones spirit and mind. Of course this view is a complete mischaracterization of a noble school, nothing more than slanders stemming from either the superstitious fear of  primal forces present in the non-magical populace or coming  from the other magical schools’ self-indulgent elitism. The easiest way to show the error in these common conceptions of destruction magic is to examine the complexity, forethought, and  self-discipline inherent in the most common form of offensive destruction, pyromancy. Specifically, let us explore how adept pyromancers have developed the ability to use fire to injure and kill, but without the fire ever truly burning their target. 

This concept of the unburning flame may sound like nonsense, but it is an essential principle for any respectable mage whom wields fire as their chosen weapon. This phenomena is accomplished through the establishment of a magicka tether between the pyromancy and their flame. Instead of flinging fires out to consume whatever fuel they might find, the pyromancer feeds magicka through this link keeping the flames satiated and dependent. Balancing the link is of the utmost importance, giving too little of one’s magicka reserves will cause the fire to fizzle out, while too much magicka can drive a mage quickly to exhaustion. With its need for nourishment met by the the magicka tether, the flame has neither an incentive to move beyond the area the mage intended or any inclination toward blackening and blistering.
 
While this may seem undesirable for someone looking to use fire as a weapon, two aspects of the flame go unaltered, the heat and the force. A flame using magical accelerants can reach high temperatures in incredibly short time periods, enveloping a foe and heating their body past its ability to function (though this can be more difficult to achieve with the Dunmer, their innate threshold for heat tolerance being significantly higher). As for the force aspect of pyromancy, a genuine fireball (accomplished by sending concentrated fire out then dramatically increasing its magicka supply on impact) can produce a blast as crushing as a blow from the largest of war-hammers. 

With all the delicate focus required in this type of pyromancy, one might ask would it not be more common for a mage to just let loose their flames to do what comes naturally? Though pyromancer’s of rumor and fiction so regularly leave their enemies charred to crisps, any who observe these mages in battle would see that this is rarely the case. To use flame magicks in the stereotypically volatile way would be a practical debacle, endangering not only the caster but the entire surrounding area. To bring forth a flame without properly limiting its desire to scorch will allow it to spread beyond its intended target, leading to a literal backfire upon the spellcaster. If the practitioners of the school of destruction were as deficient in restraint and judgment as they are so commonly discussed as being, the forests around every major magical community would be nothing but ashes and cinders. 
 
Though a pyromancer’s control of their flames is not exclusively for concerns of safety, many learn the proper technique because of their regard to honor, morality, or personal gain. When a mage so publicly defiles a living body with un-reigned fire, the grotesque spectacle can only serve to lower the repute of that mage and the association they represent, at worst gaining enemies looking for justifiable retribution. Those more interested in wealth than matters of honor still have reasons to hold back their flame, as the loot they covet on their victims would be unlikely to survive the ravages of indiscriminate fires. Even those as depraved as necromancers have reason to temper their attacks, as the damage of actually burning the body could destroy whatever usefulness that figure had. 


  It must be addressed that there are indeed mages who forgo the appropriate etiquette of pyromancy, but they should not be made the basis of  destruction mages’ reputation. The mages who allow their flames to burn do so either out of their own inexperience and ignorance of correct form, or because they take such a sadistic joy in their bringing about suffering and chaos that they throw their own safety to the wind. Both types of these pyromancers quickly find themselves dead, either claimed by their own uncontrollable flames or dealt with through the intervention of those they have harmed. To judge the whole school of destruction off of the failures of these few would be akin to disparaging mages for the ruin wrought by a dragon’s fire.

1364174135.0,75,self.teslore,1ay2zj,A quick realization on the mask of Konahrik and its link to Aka-Tusk,,86,11,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1ay2zj/a_quick_realization_on_the_mask_of_konahrik_and/,"So, for any who don't know, in *Skyrim*, there are high-level Draugr called Dragon Priests. These Dragon Priests enforced the rule of the Dragon Cult until they were overthrown, and are responsible for many of the ruins that dot Skyrim's landscape. The ruins were once temples for the Cult, and cultists would be buried there, and later cursed with undeath due to their involvement with the Cult. But that's not important right now.

What is important is a rather interesting scavenger hunt you can go on in *Skyrim*. The eight most powerful Dragon Priests were granted enchanted masks to signify their position, and grant them abnormal powers. A monument was erected at the central meeting place and home base of the Cult at Bromjunaar, where Shalidor would later construct Labyrinthian, where the masks of the eight highest-ranking priests were stored when not in use. But the monument held a greater secret than its rather mundane use suggests. When all eight masks are put into place, the monument opens up, revealing a ninth mask, the mask of the Dragon Cult's leader in Skyrim, named Konahrik. 

[Konahrik](http://images.uesp.net/a/a4/SR-item-Konahrik.jpg) is a golden mask similar in appearance to every Dragon Priest's mask, but with a striking difference. Konahrik features two tusks prominently jutting outward, something no other mask features. It seems very likely that the man who wore that mask, who made it, was the highest-ranking Priest in all the Dragon Cult, and likely would have been the right-hand human servant of Alduin himself. Alduin has a rather infamous line in *Skyrim* where he claims to be the son of Akatosh. However, we know now that Akatosh didn't come into being until many hundreds of years after Alduin was cast forward in time by the Tongues, which casts the statement of Alduin's parentage into an odd light.

Fortunately for us, Alduin's somewhat more sensible brother, Paarthurnax, says something that we can use to better interpret this statement. Paarthurnax calls their father ""Bormahu"", which means ""Father"" in Draconic. But Bormahu is both another name for a very different figure, and a reference to him in the wake of Akatosh's absorption of this individual's position. To find this figure, we have to jump into the murky legends of [The Seven Fights of the Aldudagga](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga), specifically Fight Four. Over the course of this tale, Alduin speaks to a being known as the Aka-Tusk, who says “You will eat nothing here, aspect Ald,.... Do not forget that it was Heaven itself that shed you from me.” 

This Aka-Tusk makes the claim that Alduin came from him, which would make Aka-Tusk Alduin's father-aspect, his Bormahu. Theoretically, Alduin should know Aka-Tusk as his father, and name him as such, but he calls *Akatosh* his father instead. Well, there is actually an explanation for this. To keep a very long and confusing story short, Akatosh's creation occurs during a Dragon Break. By its very nature, the Dragon Break is untime: the convergence of all possible timelines and kalpas into one existence, where everything that could be, has been, will be, and has the possibility to be or have been share space. This untime allows the events that occur within to always have been, even before they happened. Don't think on it too hard.

What matters is this: Akatosh, after his creation, replaces Auri-El as the Dragon God of Time, and Aka-Tusk as the Father of the Dovah, which is retroactive to the point where he always has been those things. But there is a clear point in history where Akatosh was not (even though he is because untime) in existence, and where Aka-Tusk is the Father of the Dovah (and more properly told, the oversoul which contains the shed aspects Alduin and Auri-El). 

My realization was this: Alduin must have told the priest who made the mask Konahrik that his ""father"", Aka-Tusk, is an incredibly powerful being, and indeed the father of all dragonkind. The priest who made Konahrik, out of a probable mix of reverence and arrogance, made his mask with tusks to symbolize his position as head of the Dragon Cult, as Aka-Tusk was the head of all dragons. Even after Akatosh's creation by the Marukhati Selective, the mask Konahrik retains its shape, stored away safely in Bromjunaar Sanctuary. The mask is a silent testament, and indeed one of the only (if not *the* only) pieces of physical evidence for the both the existence of Aka-Tusk, and that Aka-Tusk's place has been taken by Akatosh as the Father of the Dovah. It's also worth noting that Konahrik is hidden away in a specific fold of time. Perhaps it is the only bit of Time that still belongs to Auri-El, as Konahrik is perhaps the only dragon-related object that still belongs to Aka-Tusk. Thanks to morganmarz for bringing this to my attention.

Skyrim Dark Brotherhood spoilers are rampant.,,99,22,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/z5jw0/i_have_a_theory_about_astrid_skyrim_dark/,"Let's have little chat about everyone's favorite cult of psychotic murderers, the Dark Brotherhood. Specifically, the final chapter (as of *Skyrim*), nestled in the Pine Forest near Falkreath.

Astrid. I've never really gotten her in all the time I've spent in Skyrim. She just seemed so... different, from anything I was used to about previous DB chapters from *Morrowind* and *Oblivion*. I mean, yes, betrayal occurs, you become Listener/head of the DB, etc., but there's always been something off to me.

I think I may have just understood why. This is all conjecture, but I like it, and it's certainly not boring, so I'm going to consider it true until something better comes along.

Astrid truly seems to love her Family in the Dark Brotherhood. She would go as far as making a deal with a dangerous enemy of the Brotherhood to theoretically give them safety. Why does she betray you, though? Was it her feeling insecure in her role with your emergence as the Listener? Or does it come back to family?

I think it comes back to family, because, having sat and thought about it, I think she and Anbjorn are unable to have children of their own. This could be for a number of reasons, from injury with either one, to impotence or barrenness, or perhaps werewolves aren't able to have children for some reason. She's already been cut off from her biological family through the murder of her uncle, so her not being able to have a family with Anbjorn may have unhinged her a little more than she was already.

Thus her dominating style of love. She's the type of older Sister who steps up and keeps her younger Siblings in line while her Mother is out. She may be hard on them, and may have different rules, but in the end, she loves her Siblings, and would give anything to keep them safe.

Astrid's been without a true Mother in the Family for so long that she, a Dark Sister, has taken on the role of Mother. When the Night Mother arrives, it pushes her further and further. She doesn't want to give up control, because she's headstrong, and, in her mind, she knows how to better care for her Family than the Night Mother does. She takes a drastic step, and ends up betraying you, her Dark Brother, because you represent a change in power and intelligences in the Family. You're the oldest Brother, who fights her to get control back into the Mother's hands, at least in her mind. She thinks that by handing you, Mother's favorite, over to the enemy, she can keep her Siblings safe, while still maintaining control. Love has mixed with a love for power, and it's not really clear which is the dominant force.

Only when things go badly does she recognize her mistake. She knows that, by handing you over, her Family is going to die. So, she goes to her Mother, begs for forgiveness, and to save the Family. 

Now that I've thought all this through, I really have a deeper appreciation for Astrid.

This measure also coincides with the scale used in Daggerfall, which Bethesda claims is 1:1. 

Using Inkscape, I scaled a map I found to 1 pixel=1 sq. mi. Then I drew an outline around each province, and measured the areas inside each path. This produced square mileages that should be almost exact. Without further ado, here is each province compared to the country with the closest area:

___

Chances are, you'll have encountered the term ""love"" in one or more texts as you dig through them. If you're anything like myself, you'll have been confused by it when you first saw it - how does love help us prevent anything? Why is it important that we know love, when surely everyone knows it quite well? Here, I hope to make those and similar questions answered. I should note that all of this isn't entirely my work, but rather a gathering of many sources mixed with my own interpretations and concepts.

First, let's look at where exactly we're seeing the term. Perhaps the most famous example is Vehk's [Scripture of Love](http://imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-thirty-five), the thirty-fifth sermon of his thirty-six. In it, Vivec stresses the importance of love and why we should know it, but there's still not really anything to suggest what he means by it.

The other most famous example is, of course, [the Loveletter](http://imperial-library.info/content/loveletter-fifth-era-true-purpose-tamriel). The writer leaves us with quite the baffling ultimatum - ""Know Love to avoid the Landfall"". I'll explain this later, but for now I'll explain just what love is.

Love is as you know it (romantic, familial, platonic) and much more. I want to discuss the different kinds of love, increasing in breadth and depth, so by the end you'll hopefully know what love Vehk talks about.

One kind of love is something we know well - lustfulness. It is among the most basic concepts of love, that many will argue is not even considered love. Lust is the love that is driven by sexual urges, and is instinctive to us as breathing. This form of love is seen in chapter 1 of [Remanada](http://imperial-library.info/content/remanada-chapter-1-sancre-tor-and-birth-reman), which contains the famous phrase ""AND HROL DID LOVE UNTO A HILLOCK"". Vivec's [fourteenth sermon](http://imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-fourteen) tells the story of Vivec, after having much intercourse with Molag Bal, engaging in a violent orgy with the King of Rape and his demons, and presenting his ""spear"", Muatra.

Next is the kind of love best known to us. The completely non-sexual love that we feel for close friends or family; the love that can co-exist with the sexual form of love in a romantic partner. The love that a parent will unconditionally feel for their child, the love that a married couple can feel for each other long after they are not attracted to each other physically any more. This is the love that, I'm sure, springs to your mind when thinking of the term.

Then there is self-love, the complete love of oneself. It is often confused with pride, which is used when one does not have self-love. Self-love is the love of one's strengths and weaknesses, perfections and faults - it's the unconditional and complete love of oneself. It is seen by many as the most important love, and it's certainly important in understanding the following forms of love.

Now we're getting closer to what Vehk was talking about. Next is the love of the world and all people. The feeling that one gets when they feel compassion for a complete stranger. The sorrow we feel for those in poverty and those worse-off. It is not unlike self-love in that it is unconditional and of everything that pertains to it's subject, only it refers to the love in a much larger scope. It's the love of all of Nirn and it's inhabitants; the most extreme example of altruism.

The last form is what Vivec refers to. The love for *existence* - the love for the world in the past and forever into the future, the love for every single thing that exists, has existed, and will exist. It is like the previous form of love, only this love refers to that of absolutely everything with the same level of altruism. This love recognizes suffering as necessary for us to learn as a people, and it will gladly endure that suffering with the knowledge that is furthers our purpose of existence. This is the love that Vehk had for the world. This is the love that he wanted us to know.

Vivec deliberately shows us all these kinds of love, from the deepest form of existentialism to his pornographic depictions of lust. He wants us to know love.

The Loveletter warns us of the coming ""Landfall"", an unknown and catastrophic event in the future. Some may know that ""the Landfall"" is a term used to describe the events of the Red Year, where the moon Baar Dau crashed to Vvardenfell, causing it to erupt, destroying much life on it and rendering it mostly uninhabitable. Vehk wrote in his thirty-third sermon; ""if the love of the people of this city for me ever disappear, so shall the power that holds back their destruction"". He is of course, referring to Baar Dau and his claim that it is held there by the Dunmer's love for him. Eventually, he disappeared, and the Dunmer no longer loved Vivec. As written, Baar Dau fell.

I believe that, in this action, Vivec was warning the world. He taught them to love, and when they did not, there were consequences. It was his tough-love way of helping the world - just like I discussed in the last form of love. He made the world suffer so that they may learn, and reduce further suffering in the future. Because he loved the world.

This is why the Landfall is known by the same name. Both ""Landfalls"" occurred under the same conditions, and both have similar results - though the coming Landfall of the future is far greater, as the Loveletter suggests.

So now that we understand that we must love in order to protect the world, what, then, is the significance of love that gives it this power?

Love is the reason for the creation of Mundus. Lorkhan knew love, and it inspired his divine spark. He sacrificed himself to give us the gift of suffering; so that we may better ourselves as components of existence. He gave us his heart, from whence love comes. Therefore, knowing love allows you to work with the Mundus. Not knowing it will make you work against it.

In [sermon three](http://imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-three), Vivec introduces the concept of love in showing how the Dwemer did not know it. He tells of the story of his mother being kidnapped by the Dwemer, who held fascination for the egg that the unborn Vehk was inside. However, despite their best efforts, they could not open it. Vehk spoke from within the egg:

""*Love is used not only as a constituent in moods and affairs, but also as the raw material from which relationships produce hour-later exasperations, regrettably fashioned restrictions, riddles laced with affections known only to the loving couple, and looks that linger too long. Love is also an often-used ingredient in some transparent verbal and nonverbal transactions where, eventually, it can sometimes be converted to a variety of true devotions, some of which yield tough, insoluble, and infusible unions. In its basic form, love supplies approximately thirteen draughts of all energy that is derived from relationships. Its role and value in society at large are controversial.*""

Vivec would end the lesson with ""The secret to doom is within this Sermon"". Vivec demonstrated that the Dwemer did not love, and so were doomed to fail. The Dwemer worshipped no god, and ""preferred instead their gods of Reason and Logic"". They were a straight-forward, by-the-book race who just could not know love. This surfaced in Kagrenac, who like his passionless race did not love, failed in his attempts to achieve transcendence, dooming the Dwemer to a non-existence.

Finally, I will leave you a more current example. The Thalmor, though ever-zealous, will suffer the same damnation of the Dwemer. They oppose Lorkhan and actively try to remove him from existence. Therefore, they reject, too, his heart. They will never know love.

By Carcinogen, 4E 201


The races of Tamriel vary greatly, and as such, have different burial customs to fit their differing cultures. This essay deals with the particularities of these customs, and is split into two parts for the sake of convenience. This first half will deal with the Altmer, Argonians, Bosmer, Bretons and finally Dunmer.


**Altmer**


The Altmer have a great deal of respect for their ancestors, and treat their remains with great care. Altmer are traditionally interred at the top of the towers that dot the land of Alinor, with the taller towers being reserved for more important people.^1 According to The Pocket Guide, 3rd Edition, Crystal-Like-Law was a resting place for many:


&gt;""When the Aldmer came together as a people to create the Crystal Tower, it was not a monument to any king or god, but rather to the spirit of the elven people, living and dead. Within the glittering walls of the Tower are housed the graves of the early Aldmeri settlers""^2


When Crystal-Like-Law collapsed, the remains of many eminent figures were lost. :(


The Altmer have gained a notoriety for taking and slaying some babies, with the goal of retaining racial purity.^3 One can only hope that this is false, but whether it is true or not, it is unlikely these infants would be given the honor of being laid to rest in the towers.


**Argonians**


Little is known about how the Argonians deal with their dead. The moist climate of Black Marsh means that bodies rot very quickly; often, there is no need to bury the deceased.^4


The Argonians who live by the coast are inclined towards sea burials^5, but the actions of Sload necromancers has made this practice less desirable.^4 In general, it seems the Argonians do not care much about what happens to their bodies^6, though like all races, they would rather have their remains returned to their homeland.^7


**Bosmer**


Some Bosmer adopt Imperial customs by burying their dead, but this is mostly seen outside of Valenwood.^4 A particularity of the Bosmer of Valenwood is that they must not harm any plant life from within the province, in accordance with the Green Pact made with Y'ffre. As such, they are strictly carnivorous, and will even resort to cannibalism. In fact, the Meat Mandate, a section of the Green Pact, says that the Bosmer must eat any enemy that they slay.^8 This reduces the number of bodies to bury, to an extent.


Another thing that is unique to the Bosmer is that they have the power to call upon a primal ability called the 'Wild Hunt'. In times of need, the Bosmer can take on bestial forms, and mow down their opponents.^8 The transformation is permanent, and those who survive tend to turn on each other.^9 While there have been very few Wild Hunts in history, there is often a shortage of corpses soon after one has taken place.


**Bretons**


The Bretons, despite having come from the Altmer and Nedic people, have developed customs that are very distinct from those of their ancestors. They are nearly exclusively cremated in the northern parts of High Rock. This tradition has survived centuries, but the fact that people in the south now tend toward Imperial burials in graveyards shows the influence that Cyrodiil has had on the Bretons.^4


**Dunmer**


Of all the races, we know perhaps the most about Dunmer burials. The Dark Elves of Morrowind feel that it is their duty to treat their ancestors' remains with the utmost respect: the ancestors of the Dunmer can be called upon to serve them even after death.


Due to the billowing of Red Mountain, the land of Vvardenfell, and parts of mainland Morrowind have been showered with ash. The Dunmer feel that it is only appropriate that they return to ash after death, and so they are almost exclusively cremated. It would be unthinkable to leave them to rot, or to bury them in the Imperial manner.


In the past, most would inter the remains of their ancestors in a City of the Dead, with Necrom being the most famous. Necrom has traditionally been reserved for model citizens and warriors, so most Dunmer are put to rest in family ancestral tombs. Ashpits house the remains themselves, and offerings are made periodically, to please the dead.


Previously, these tombs, and other lands belonging to the clan, were protected by a ghost fence. The deceased would provide a bone which would then be enchanted, and used to create a beacon, of sorts.
Due to the spread of the Corprus disease in the Third Era, the clan ghost fences were left untended in favor of the Great Ghost Fence surrounding Red Mountain. A statement was released by the Temple, asking people to contribute to the Great Ghost Fence, and so it became convention to do so. Entire skeletons would be offered up, and so the Dunmer would ""venerate a small portion of their ancestor's remains kept at a local temple.""^10


In the Fourth Era, the Dunmer were hit by a catastrophe. The eruption of Red Mountain demolished most cities on Vvardenfell, and had terrible effects as far south as [Tear](http://i.imgur.com/8duPrng.jpg).^11 Most of Morrowind was ravaged, and many ancestral tombs were completely destroyed. Following this, the Argonian invasion forced many to flee the land.^12


The Dunmer have gradually been forced to forgo their culture, but with the advent of the New Temple, one can only hope that their previous burial customs will begin to return.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_19nyhj,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19nyhj/burial_customs_of_the_10_races_part_1/,
1365519624.0,77,self.teslore,1bzq5i,The Nords and the Giants,morganmarz,86,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bzq5i/the_nords_and_the_giants/,"We don't know a lot about the giants, but i've read a few things here and there and noticed some other things in game that leads me to the conclusion that there is a definite connection there, somehow. Let me lay out my evidence for you:

The main body of lore that supports this is [The Seven Fights of The Aldudagga](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga), specifically, Fight Six, ""The 911th Cow"". Let me quote here:

&gt;And of the **Giants** we speak little, even less to strangers, for their history is hidden in long loud power-shouts. At home, it is a pain in the  to tell their stories and then clean all the things knocked down in the telling... and in a foreign hearth it is [just plain rude]. So we speak of them (for we must-- who does not honor their **parents**?) under the **rim of the sky** or, here, written on sheafs of pelt, for such is the mettle of their threat. This is [a song (or dirge, manuscript unclear)], then, of the threat of Giants and, like most, it involves painted cows.

In other words this author, a Nord, is explaining that the Giants are the Nords' ancestors. This bit, ""their history is hidden in long loud power-shouts,"" is interesting, and i'm not sure what implications it might have.  
Later on we have this:

&gt;Here is why: the **Giants** came from **Old Atmora**, up there across the Northern Ice back in the gone-to-twilight-now age of myth... and settled here in the **Skyrim**, and all along the mountain ranges of our coasts. (Yes, they are our **true ancestors**-- do not believe your aunt from the university-- and, yes, we were once as big as them-- as tall as THIS-- but that is another story)... [text lost]... and after [the Great Calamity] happened [the clan-things (peoples? tribes? Text seems to indicate mankind as a whole, though that is debateable)]... we were of a kind disrupted... and we Nords fell into fighting and drove our Giant-kin up unto the mountaintops [and we were a wicked-folk for many years]... [until all] things had changed forever.

So the giants came from Old Atmora, eh? Also from the Seven Fights, an image is hidden right at the end of fight five. [TALOS FAREWELLS THE KING OF ATMORA](http://www.imperial-library.info/sites/default/files/obscure_talos-king-atmora.jpg). Notice not only the size of the king, but also the clothing reminiscent of the giants of modern day skyrim. Notice the swirls tattooed or carved into his skin. At the very least we can assume that MK is *implying* something pretty heavily. I won't get into the ""mankind as a whole"" thing because as the text says, it's ""debatable,"" much moreso than anything else here.
Continued:

&gt;Once the Moot resumed [(unspecified) years later] things got back to a new semblance of normalcy and borders were redrawn and agreed with in beer-talk, and raidings of the merethlands took everyone's mind off old feuds, and pretty soon (well, not pretty soon but whatever) the Giants began to come down from the mountains again. And they were a bit different than we Nords remembered, or perhaps we had forgotten much, but they would not speak to us anymore-- they would only smile in their lazy way, stomp over, and take our stuff.

Now maybe i'm mistaken, but could the raidings of the merethlands be the Alessian Rebellion, when the Nords came to help the Nedes revolt against the Ayleids? Any which way, after whatever raidings they had, the Nords met again with the giants, and something seemed to have happened that had changed the giants, or maybe the nords, but probably both. They could no longer communicate. Now the giants are described as they act in *Skyrim*.

From then on we have the story of the child Aless (whose namesake is Alessia) painting the cows to summon the giants to fight Alduin. Dagon tries to trick her so she tricks him right back. What is really interesting though is that the tradition of painting cows for the giants continues into modern day Skyrim. Neat-o.  
About the swirls:

&gt;""Then of course the swirls, which we Nords paint the same no matter whichever clan we belong to, because the Giants speak only ONE language and it's in our best interest to talk straight with them.

So the Giants do have a language, and the Nords do know how to communicate with them. Through the language of swirls, basically.

A lot of this hinges on not much more than swirls. [Let me show you.](http://imgur.com/a/ag7xm) Now, making sure that you've read all those descriptions, i'll try to make a few connections here.

Remember how the Giants' ""history is hidden in long loud power-shouts""? Notice the swirls on the Bromjunaar monument; they come from the mouth as if to demonstrate the Thu'um. Now i'm not saying that stories are written in the swirls, but that the swirls are *representative* of speech. Aless said that the giants have one language; the narrator said the Nords couldn't speak with the Giants after their schism. So how do they communicate? Swirls. The modern painted cow shows that they still maintain the tradition.

**Basically**, the Nords and the Giants came from a common ancestor, the Giants of Atmora. At some point, they split, and they both probably shrunk a lot (that King looks awful big!), but the Nords moreso than the Giants. The ancient Nord-Giants had a distinctive style of art that was very heavy on the swirls. This style of art, and the symbolism that both cultures associated with it, has enabled the two now-distinct peoples to communicate (albeit in a rather sparse fashion) for centuries since.

---

Now i'd like to point out the main flaw in all of this: ears. Giants have pointed elf-like ears and Nords have human round ears. What's up with that? I don't know. Seriously no clue.

---

Edit: /u/aussum_possum reminded me of the frost giants and Karstaag. Way less is known about them. Suffice it to say that he frost giants of *Dawnguard* appear to be more savage than the normal giants of *Skyrim*. Karstaag is a frost giant who ruled over Rieklings during the events of *Morrowind: Bloodmoon*. We don't know a whole lot about the frost giants in general, or how they relate to the regular giants.

Basically the people of Rorikstead seem to be hiding something. Thy transformed from a horrid place to grow crops to having the best soil in Skyrim. 
To someone who has played oblivion, this should sound familiar. In oblivion there was a small town south of chorrol knnown as Hackdirt. The residents of the town were unwelcoming and seemed to have some sort of secret. A traders daughter goes missing there, and the Champion of Cyrodil investigates. Only to find that the town was a cult worshipping some sort of being who in return gave them great ore. (Read further at: http://uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Hackdirt)

Maybe it's not a daedric power influencing Rorikstead, maybe it's an entirely different kind of being. Recall in Hackdirt a sacrifice was being made, perhaps the man killed by skeavers was a sacrifice, and his body planted there, or even the being may have used the skeavers to claim its prize. 

That's my take on the Rorikstead theory. What do you think? Way off or near home base?

Edit: Revisited Hackdirt myself, the Bible of the Deep Ones is in fact Daedric, but I'm not to assume it was written by a Daedric Prince. I believe it to be work of a lesser Daedra, similar to one I read in a book. Looking for the book now, should be able to find it in the Arcane University somewhere.

They hang out in ruined forts and apart from their silver weapons, they mostly use the same sort of equipment.

I'll start with this, a question many, many people have asked so many times that I can't count them:

**How will the result be recorded canonically if both sides can win?**

Well, as with most things, there are many ways this could happen. Some of the most popular are things like:

* The Thalmor will make a move and overshadow the ending of the war.

* Tullius and Ulfric both die, and Skyrim successfully gains its independence.

* A Dragon Break (which is complete poppycock).

Now, here's how I think it'll go down (feel free to argue):

The Stormcloaks will come out on top. They may not crush the Legion like they do in-game, but they'll pull through. I think that if either side could see the point of their struggle clearly, the Imperial Legion would withdraw. The Empire of Tiber Septim has come to its final days, and yet it still clings to pitiful life as a union of, in total, High Rock (untrustworthy and militarily incompetent), Skyrim (powerful and known to aid the Empire, but stands opposed as of now), and Cyrodiil (a province still recovering from the Great War with its troops spread too far and its leader dead). There's nothing left in the Empire for Skyrim, and as such they are right to want independence.

Along with this, if Skyrim were to win out, High Rock would almost certainly cut ties with the Empire (they're literally backed into a corner) and Hammerfell United (a province reputed to be as close to unstoppable as you can get when united as the are) would likely want all the help they can get (and from the Nords, no less). Not only is the Empire lacking, but independence is looking very beneficial to the Nords and everyone else.

_______

Now, I mentioned a Dragon Break as a commonly thrown-around possibility for resolving the conflict, and I also said it's poppycock. Here's why:

Dragon Breaks are incredibly rare and powerful events that don't just ""happen"". There are 2 possible endings to an utterly petty war, as well as the fact that neither side could ever have a chance of even *causing* a Dragon Break. They are events that occur very very very rarely, almost only when Numidium is activated (a whole other topic in itself). The likelihood of one occurring is a 0% chance, and no exceptions.

______

Another thing I'd like some feedback on:

**Is the one who fights for either side actually the Dovahkiin?**

It's a question that doesn't really get asked, so I'm asking. In every other faction questline, we can confidently say that the Dovahkiin is not the actual person involved. However, people always assume he's leading the charge during the Civil War questline. I feel like the Dovahkiin has very little reason to aid either side, and if he did, he'd very likely be mentioned in future sources (that is, it would read something like ""Although the Skyrim Civil War proved inconclusive, it was reported that during the latter days of the fighting, the Dovahkiin was found to have been fighting for both sides,"" and an idea I'd dismiss).

So, tell me, scholars, does this answer your questions about the Civil War? Does it lay out the facts as they are (if a tad biased)? Do you disagree with me and think that the Empire is surviving and should be the proper winners?

Now I know a lot of you guys don't like the newest game (I'm not particularly happy about some the decisions myself) but let's try to keep this civil. 

First of all we see a group of warriors, a Nord, two Dunmer and another but I'm not sure what it is. They clearly represent the Ebonheart pact. They are moving through a dungeon and we see bodies and as we move deeper we see what looks like an undead werewolf. This seems to fit considering the main antagonist of the game is Mannimarco King of Worms. 

Next off it moves to a scene of a siege of a fortress. I think the fortress is in the Jerrel mountains considering we can see unimpeded to the Imperial city. There are a number of Nords scaling the fortress and what looks to be Imperial Legion soldiers defending. The scene cuts to a nearby cliff and it looks like one of the human races is leading the assault.  We also see an Elven mage amidst the defenders. I'm hesitent to call her an Altmer or a Bosmer because she lacks the height, arrogance and skin of an Altmer. But the Bosmer arent usually associated with being mages so I'm not sure.

After a battle scene the Elf and Human stair down when the Nord pops in. Now clearly each warrior represents each of the games factions.  The Nord represents the Ebonheart pact, the Elf the Aldmeri Dominion, and the human (which I think is a Breton) represents the Daggerfall Covenant.

I've been asked to post on the reddit the work I am doing on the Jel language, and I must say I'm flattered by the interest this little project of mine is getting. So, here goes:
**Jel** is the language spoken in Black Marsh by the native Argonian race. It is famous in all of Tamriel for its complicated grammar and hellish pronounciation, which make it very difficult for humans and mer to pronounce correctly. Jel has no plurals and no tense.

**Pronounciation**

The Jel alphabet goes:

**a, ch, d, e, g, h, i, j, jh, k, l, lh, ny, n, o, q, r, s, t, th, ts, u, w, x, y, p**

Jel has no *labial* consonants, i.e. consonants that are pronounced with the help of the lips, since Argonians don't have any.

**a** is pronounced like in English *father*.

**ch** sounds like a *ky* pronounced very fast, somewhat like in *backyard*.

**d** is like in English *dog*.

**e** is pronounced roughly like the *ay* in *say* when stressed, laxer when unstressed.

**g** is like in English *go*.

**h** is like in English but voiced.

**i** is like the *ee* in English *free*, but laxer when unstressed.

**j** is pronounced *dz*.

**jh** is pronounced like a very fast *gy*; it's the voiced counterpart to *ch*.

**k** is like in English *Kate*.

**l** is like in English *lake*, never as in *dull*.

**lh** is really difficult. It's a voiced Welsh *ll* as in *Llanelli*. Put your tongue in the position for *l*, and then blow.

**ny** is somewhat like in *canyon*.

**n** is like in English *nine*.

**o** is like in English *so*, but unrounded (the lips don't ""bunch"" when pronouncing it).

**q** is another difficult sound, namely a voiced German *ch* as in *ich*.

**r** is a tap, like in English with a Scottish accent.

**s** is like the *z* in English *zoo*.

**t** is like in English *too*.

**th** is always like in English *there*, except before unvoiced consonants, when it becomes as in *bath*.

**ts** is pronounced like in English *guts*.

**u** is like the *oo* in English *moon*, but unrounded, like in Japanese.

**w** is like in English *well*, but unrounded.

**x** is a voiced German *ch* as in *Bach*.

**y** is like in English *yell*.

The last consonant appears as **p** only at the end of a word, but is present at the beginning of every syllable that begins with a vowel. It is a glottal stop, i.e. the sound between the sillables in English *oh-oh* or the apostrophe in Hawaiian *Hawai'i*.
The stress always falls on syllables containing a long vowel, a diphthong or ending with a click.
Otherwise it falls on the penultimate.
There are also two sounds which are very alien to an English speaker, which are the **clicks**. 
In Argonian, they are **c'**, pronounced like in English *tsk tsk*, and **xh** which is a loud click of the tongue.

**Pronouns**

Jel has two sets of pronouns: the “connected” set, used to refer to all individuals connected through the Hist, i.e. all Argonians, and a “disconnected” set, used for everything else.
The Argonians make no distinction in number, so understanding whether a given pronoun refers to a single individual or to a group of people is entirely a matter of context.

**Connected**

1st person: **sep**

2nd person: **xho**

3rd person: **suu**

4th person: **c'a**

The 4th person is a special pronoun which we could call a “hyper-inclusive we”, which is used to refer to every being connected through the Hist at the same time, and is therefore the only pronoun which carries some sense of plurality, although this is misleading, since the Argonians perceive themselves as one when they're connected. Depending on context, it can be translated as “the whole world” or “the Argonian people” or other such expressions.

**Disconnected**

1st person: **see**

2nd person: **to**

3rd person: **thuu**

The “disconnected” set is a later derivation of the “connected” set, created when the Argonians were forcibly taken out of their millennia-long isolation by the Alessian Empire in the First Era, is used to refer to all non-Argonians, which Argonians perceive as being “disconnected” in some way. This is a very discomforting feeling to Argonians, which need to get used to it before interacting with other peoples on a long-term basis.
There is no “collective” 4th person.

**Use of the Pronouns**

All Argonians refer to themselves and their peers with the “connected” set of pronouns, although in special circumstances, such as when speaking with a tribe-leader or a very important individual, an Argonian may refer to himself with the “disconnected” 1st person pronoun, to suggest humility, implying that he's not worthy of being connected through the same Hist as whatever person he's talking to. To address an Argonian with the “disconnected” 2nd person pronoun is in an of itself a powerful insult, and it's not that rare to hear enemy tribes refer to each other as thuu rather than suu. Conversely, every non-Argonian must refer to himself and to his peers with the “disconnected” set of pronouns. To do differently would be seen as unbelievably arrogant and insulting. Argonians may refer to non-Argonians with the “connected” set of pronouns when these strangers have done them a great favour or when they consider them close friends (eg. Mere-Glim probably addressed Annaïg with *xho*). 

**Syntax**

Unmarked word order is **OSV** (Object-Subject-Verb), when the subject of the verb is a pronoun, however, it becomes OVS.

And, last but not least,

**Some Important Suffixes**

**The Possessive Suffix**

Jel marks the possessed noun, not the possessor. The suffix used is **-uth** if the noun ends in a consonant, and **-huth** if it ends in a vowel.

**The Ablative Suffix**

The suffix **-duj** means *from, originating from*.

**The Purposive Suffix**

The suffix **-to** means *(in order) to*.

**The Derisive Suffix**

The suffix **-luu** indicates amusement or mocking intent.

**The Locative Suffix**

The suffix **-daa** means *in, inside*.

This is about it for the grammar at the moment.
Here's the sample sentences I've made:

**Suur Haj-Ei golt. **

*Hist.Sap Haj-Ei drink**

Haj-Ei drinks Hist-Sap

**Suur golt-suu.**

*Hist.Sap drink-he/she*

He/she drinks Hist-Sap.

**Hajhiit maagaruth goc'daa gooluu.**

*Khajiit cart-POS mud-LOC get.stuck-DER*

The Khajiit's cart got stuck in the mud.

**Thuu chakkuth lod Hajhiit c’oo? Hajhiit gortsuquth gorihuth thuu gooluthduj thdeitoluu!**

*they butt-POS lick Khajiit why? Khajiit cuisine-POS flavour-POS they mouth-POS-ABL chase.away-PUR-DER*

Why do Khajiit lick their butts? To get the taste of their cooking out of their mouths! (The famous ""Khajiit joke"")

UPDATE:

**The Jel Verb**

The Jel verb has no tense and doesn't distinguish between persons, but it does distinguish three aspects, five moods, two voices and three cathegories of evidentials. There are also suffixes which I call ""emotionals"", which specify how the speaker feels about the utterance, and various other suffixes.

**Aspect**

There are three aspects: the **perfective**, the **imperfective** and the **punctual**. 

The **punctual** aspect is unmarked, and indicates an action performed once, without any indication as to whether it's been finished or it's still in progress.

**Gor Annaig tsuq.**

Annaïg cooks./Annaïg cooked./Annaïg will cook.

The **imperfective** mood is marked by the suffix **-re**, and indicates an actions which is incomplete, either because it's still in progress or because it was never finished.

**Gor Annaig tsuqre.**

Annaïg is cooking./Annaïg cooked (but didn't finish)

The **perfective** mood is marked by the suffix **-loj**, and indicates an action which has been completed.

**Gor Annaig tsuqloj.**

Annaïg has cooked.

**Mood**

There are five moods: the **indicative**, the **irrealis**, the **imperative**, the **purposive** and the **optative**.

The **indicative** is unmarked and indicates that the sentence is a factual statement, without personal bias.

**Gor Annaig tsuq.**

Annaïg cooks.

The **irrealis** is marked by the suffix **-uxh**, and indicates that the sentence is not actually all that factual. It is used in ""if-clauses"" and is required by some evidentials.

**Gor Annaig tsuquxh.**

Annaïg may be cooking.

The **imperative** mood is marked by the suffix **-lop**, and sometimes by the particle **c'ee**, which is placed at the beginning of a sentence. It is used for commands.

**C'ee gor tsuqlop!**

Cook!

The **purposive** is marked by the suffix **-to**, and indicates purpose (""in order to..."").

**Gor Annaig tsuqto, gorjhig rogitee-xho.**

In order for Annaïg to cook, you must bring over the pot.

The **optative** is marked by the suffix **-thelh**, and indicates desire.

**Gor Annaig tsuqthelh!**

How I wish Annaïg would cook!

It's not my best piece, and I think it could be much better, but because of my lack of skills (and my low quality camera) these are the final versions.

As we discussed in the first post the elven warriors are using armors inspired by skyrim's elven armor, but they use shields from skyrim and oblivion (the oblivion version was way more easier to draw). The Thalmor banner was a pain to draw, because of the lack of references.

In the imperial side I opted by the ""romanish"" lorica segmentata of skyrim's legionaries, but used oblivions shields (more simple to draw, and IMO, they look better). As pointed by our colleagues there are orcs, red guards, nords and imperials among the legion's ranks (sadly they are hardly noticeable because of the low quality photograph). And finally, there is Titus II wielding goldbrand in all his glory, using a set of armor inspired by general Tulius armor.

As discussed in the previous post there's no evidence if the battle where Titus captured Naarifin was inside the city walls or in the open field. I opted by the open field for scenery reasons.

1361206178.0,69,self.teslore,18rae0,2E830-2E852 How Plausible ESO actually is.,Wabbstarful,86,17,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18rae0/2e8302e852_how_plausible_eso_actually_is/,"Well we have had some debate in the past on how well the lore works. Today I'm going to show you how I took a 180 on ESO after some research. I just want to present to you some facts on how this game can* be plausible for the lore-friendly scholar such as you beautiful people. 

**First of all: The Date**. (and some groovy background):

ESO takes place 1000 years before skyrim, the Aldmeri Dominion does not appear until 2E830. Supposedly the joint forces of Valenwood, the provinces of Elsweyr and the Sommerset Isles were the first Aldmeri Dominion. This is true to the fact that the super young Queen Ayrenn (28 years old!) established the dominion with the sole purpose for defeating Molag Bal.....and getting her revenge. That would make 2E830 a pretty darn good starting date. **NOW** Tiber Septim clearly hasn't arisen yet and, well, the lot of you know those details already about the most glorious emperor to ever live, I digress. **2E852**, Cuhlecain of the Colovian Highlands marches to the Imperial city and crowns himself emperor. ""It's OVER!"" for ESO during this date, that is. This must mean that ESO takes place between 830 and 852. 

Ok so good start so far, right? Well, most of you guys are annoyed by the fact that the Ebonheart Pact even exists. So I'm gonna help you disbelievers come to terms with the idea. 

**The Ebonheart Pact:**

The Ebonheart Pact is a joint agreement to ally Skyrim, the Tribunal of Morrowind, and Argonia into a powerful force to stop Molag Bal and seat Jorunn as the Emperor (or the player that is). After the Incident at Necrom and the whole war against Akavir, these three despised neighbors have lightened up a *bit*. Now to accept their rationality for creating such a Pact I would suggest you all to consider the alliance during the Seven Years War with France, Austria and Russia. These blokes *HATED* each other, however, they knew a truce to destroy an even greater looming threat of two highly militarized nations (Britain and Prussia) was necessary. I see it that unifying after the invasion and being threatened by Molag Bal (not to mention HIS HUGE-ASS multiplied daedra army walking all over this damn place) is none-to-settling. Thus an arrangement must be made for the greater good and survival of these three nations. 

**Lastly**: 

This is probably the final factor, many of you are worried the devs are going way in over their heads for such a game, this means to you, sacrifice in ALOT of things that you loved. Of course this will be inevitable, however, do not be too discouraged. The creators have been doing some pretty neat things that even I was surprised to see be pulled off. They have taken the original models of the creatures, buildings and items from Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim and gave them new physics to coexist in the new Massive Uniserver. (I will share some of the videos with you all after) 

Second, Our only real major threat, ""I don't want this game to look or feel like WoW"". I completely agree with that one. I dare say it will, *somewhat*. We need to understand that Zenimax wants to appeal to two crowds here. The people won't likely entirely look like them, perhaps with a more fable-Skyrim look to allow a smooth transition for MMO players. There has been ALOT of tweaking, fortunately, and the more I see release on the development, the more I seem to be wrong how warcrafty the characters are. Not to mention, we have a beta coming up with tons of fans from all fields who will most likely grill the creators with feedback (good feedback too i hope!) So keep this in mind when you watch or rewatch the gameplay footage at the end. 

And lastly to our ""Last Part"". GAMEPLAY. You will be able to see this for yourself, however just know this, there will be 1st and 3rd person gameplay with ""a developed sense of combat similar to the previous elderscrolls"" 

The rest is up to you, dear scholar, will you find the fun in such a game and enjoy it? Or will you go back to lurking a dusty old tome and fight a dragon with your mouth?  

And now the introduction to the ESO gameplay, for those of you who haven't seen it, enjoy.

**Edit:** I want to also mention that there have been reviews of the Alpha testing among magazine publishers, podcast hosts and other known game enthusiasts. From what I've heard from all of them is that ESO has a very unique feel nothing similar to that of WoW or the majority of MMO games.

The thing that has been bothering me the most, is the proclamation of this current Dragonborn, being the Last Dragonborn. Alduin's Wall unequivocally states that the wheel will turn to the last Dragonborn. What does it mean to be the last Dragonborn? Why would Shor/Lorkhan knowingly proclaim that the Last of the Dragonborn will return with Alduin to stop him from ending the current kalpa? Perhaps most intriguing is the MK's posting dealing with the spelling of Lorkhan. The way I interpreted his post was as follows: Each letter represents a portion of the oversoul that is/was/could be Lorkhan. As Lorkhan's avatars return to Nirn throughout history, they have, each in their own way had a quantifiable and lasting effect on Tamriel's history.

Now here is where I start to feel loopy. The Last Dragonborn is the completion of the Oversoul of Lorkhan, and upon his ""death"" the combined souls of all of the Shezarrines will come together to spiritually recreate Lorkhans heart, and return Lorkhan to prominence. We know that the properties of Lorkhan's heart can be mimicked, ala the mantella, but only when filled with the soul(s) of a Shezzarine. So what is to stop the souls of Lorkhan's avatars from having their souls combined after ""death"" to revive Lorkhan's heart and thus, Lorkhan himself.

Stretching a bit further now, maybe this is a part of the Thalmor's logic, and ultimately their plans to return to Aetherius. Perhaps they view the apotheosis of Tiber Septim into Talos as the first step in the process of returning the missing god to the Pantheon. With the completion of L.O.R.K.H.A.N. via the Last Dragonborn's inclusion into Lorkhan's oversoul, Talos would return to being Lorkhan, and the Thalmor will have lost their chance to rid Nirn of Lorkhan, his avatars, and their influence.

  This got me to thinking how...well, put simply...cool it would be AND helpful if some of the lore veterans were to organize some ""lessons"" into a PDF or Ebook. Subjects could be separated into history, politics, metaphysics, magicka studies, and so on and so forth.

  Perhaps, even taking it a step further, some of us could do short little videos instructing lore-starved fans in basic concepts or intriguing ideas.

/r/teslore seems a lot different to how it used to be, and a lot different to how, as moderators, we've tried to shape its purpose. With ever-expanding members and with Skyrim's popularity, we figured it was inevitable, but tried to maintain what /r/teslore is. It didn't really work.

We've lost a lot of regulars over the past weeks, either from them outright leaving or they're simply not finding topics to talk about (as has been my issue). But I think the regulars that are still here will be able to tell the difference between the front page of /r/teslore a few months ago, and the front page of it now. It's gone from a general, wide scope of discussion of lore, to talk about Skyrim's (and by extension, Dawnguard's) tidbits of information. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so.

Now, don't get me wrong, it isn't a bad thing. I can't be a bad thing, because the community has made it serve the purpose they'd like it to serve. It would be unreasonable, and downright preposterous, for me to be frustrated by the way /r/teslore has been naturally shaped by its members. Instead, I want to ask you guys what you think the purpose and nature of /r/teslore should be.

What do you think? Should we increase our efforts to ensure /r/teslore is a quality discussion-oriented community with an emphasis on lore as a whole, as it has always been, or should we just butt out and just let it run its course as a general Elder Scrolls subreddit? Or something else altogether?

**EDIT**: Thanks for your input so far, guys. I should further emphasize that I don't only mean the content of the subreddit has wavered, but also its standard of quality. Take [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/vsjmf/morrowind_introduced_by_a_bosmer_or_a_khajiit/) for example. It doesn't have anything to do with lore - or at least, not enough - and that's quite obvious. xenoposeidon rightfully pointed this out, as should be expected of our community, but he was met with a spam of downvotes. That's not what this subreddit is about. [This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/us40m/i_heard_you_guys_hate_tes_online_because_it/) had 45 comments before I could get to it, and it was simply a circlejerk of hating on Zenimax (I don't disagree, but this isn't the place for it). Both of these threads looked at TES from a general point-of-view rather than the lore itself.

You guys seem to have made it clear that we don't want /r/teslore turning into a general TES subreddit.

**What is *The Elder Scrolls*?**

*The Elder Scrolls* (often abbreviated TES) is a series of RPGs (role-playing games) developed by Bethesda Game Studios. The series began with the release of *The Elder Scrolls: Arena* in 1994, followed by many sequals in subsequent years: *The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall* in 1996, *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* in 2002, *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* in 2006, and *The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim* in 2011. Aside from the main games in the series, TES has also spawned smaller games such as *An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire* and *The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard*.

TES has spiked in popularity with each release, achieving mainstream popularity most notably for *Oblivion*, and even more so for *Skyrim*. The series is renowned for its open-world freedom and for the seemingly bottomless depth of its lore.

**What is ""lore""?**

The prestigious Wiktionary describes lore as:

&gt;3. *All the facts and traditions about a particular subject that have been accumulated over time through education or experience.*

&gt; 2. *The backstory created around a fictional universe.*

&gt; 3. *(anatomy) The region between the eyes and nostrils of birds, reptiles, and amphibians.*

In this sense, lore obviously refers to the second definition, but TES's lore is so vast and deep that one could have no trouble considering it to mean the first, although probably not the third. But you have learned something new about biology.

Many fans have become devoted to TES lore because of it's uniqueness and sheer amount, and many are interested by the wealth of lore more than the games. r/teslore is a place for such people to discuss and learn about the lore among like-minded individuals.

The nature of TES lore has caused it to become almost separate from the games, as the games feature only a very small scope of the lore as a whole. This could be because of gameplay limitations, developers choosing to dismiss it for convenience, or because lore is so intricate and vast that it would probably scare off the new player. It's most likely a combination of all three. Some argue that only the lore that is featured within the games can be canon.

**Who writes the lore?**

The lore is a collective effort of many developers at Bethesda, through the stories and environments of each game, and the countless books included. Most notably, though, the lore is written by Michael Kirkbride, or ""*MK*"". Redguard and Morrowind were the games of TES that dramatically changed the lore and created vast amounts of new lore to form the foundations for the brilliance it is today. Before those games, TES was largely a generic fantasy game. It's no coincidence that Kirkbride has, during his short time at Bethesda, been a part of the development team only for those games. Kirkbride is largely responsible, although not solely, for making TES lore the way it is today. Although no longer under official employment at Bethesda, Kirkbride continues to add to TES by posting new texts and ideas to places like the official forums and The Imperial Library, and occasionally doing contract work (typically involving book writing) for Bethesda's more recent games.

MK is (in)famous for introducing weird and wonderful concepts into TES that are far from what put in front of us in the games. In fact, the difficulty to understand these concepts and the difference between his exclusively out-of-game lore and lore we see in-game, along with his somewhat unofficial position, are often points of contention regarding the legitimacy of his ideas. Some don't consider his work to be canon at all.

If those people believe MK's work is too unofficial to be canon, then they'll despise the next group of writers I'm going to mention - the community. The nature of TES lore is a very weird one. Over time, through discussion, lore is shaped and moulded and interpreted until it's difficult to see what's official and what's purely discussion-created conjecture. There's a name for such content - ""*monkeytruth*"". Entire texts written by fans can also be called monkeytruth, provided they make for good lore and tell us stuff we can't otherwise know. Lady N, librarian at The Imperial Library, explains well in her guide on [How to Become a Lore Buff](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1112211-how-to-become-a-lore-buff/):

&gt;*""Good lore evokes wonder, subverts cliche, and breaks stereotype.*

&gt;*Since Daggerfall the lore of the Elder Scrolls has been getting more alien and more complex. Concepts found elsewhere in fantasy - evil dark elves, hippie wood elves, Scottish dwarves - have no place in the modern concept of lore. They have been replaced with unique societies and new concepts. TES lore has its own set of symbols and meanings that is separated from both cliche fantasy and from the real world. It evokes wonder by pushing our idea of what is possible and what is real, all the while suspending our disbelief. Glass, which is fragile in reality, makes some of the best armor around. Blind priests go clothed in moths carrying the spirits of our ancestors. Swords cut atoms and brought about the fall of a continent.*

&gt;*BATW, meaning Boring and Therefore Wrong, is the exact opposite of good lore. It is cliche or stereotype, and it relies on what we already know as opposed to what we can imagine. Giving the Bosmer art nouveau type architecture is BATW because it is expected, and because we have seen it in a dozen other depictions of elves. Likewise, attributing the fall of Yokuda to a natural earthquake is BATW due to its everydayness. Having it break asunder because of a sword move which is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb, on the other hand, is unusual and pushes our imagination.*

&gt;*Monkey Truth is good (unique, imaginative) lore created by fans. Much like the Obscure Texts, it is meant to fill in gaps or expand existing lore. While it does add in wholly new elements, its main purpose is to expand what is already there. You will likely not encounter it in your initial studies, but threads on undeveloped subjects sometimes turn to the creation of monkey truth.*""

As mentioned before, monkeytruth is also considered by some to be non-canon because it is ""unofficial"". All this talk of canon will probably leave you thinking:

**How do I know what is canon and what isn't?**

As far as r/teslore is concerned, you don't. Canonicity is a concept that doesn't apply well to TES lore, because the very nature of it causes there to be no official rule we can use to govern what's canon and what's not. It's completely up to the individual - we don't think there should be rules on how to be fan of something.

If this is so, however, we should expect there to be issues when it comes to community like ours, which allows any and all lore. In TES lore communities, since the beginning of time, there are those who exclude some aspecs of lore, so come along and try to ruin it for those who include them by saying they're ""non-canon"" or ""unofficial"" and therefore wrong. This is inconsiderate, not understanding of lore, and quite basically, counter-intuitive to discussion. r/teslore is a discussion-based subreddit, so we aim to allow *all* fans of lore to discuss what they want.

How do we ensure that? Well, as this [crude MSPaint diagram](http://i.imgur.com/uTYmB.png) somewhat depicts, there are typically two main groups of lore fans. Those that consider only in-game lore to be canon, and those that consider out-of-game lore to be canon also. Let's call them Group A and B, respectively, and the lore they consider canon Lore A and Lore B, respectively. Lore A is exclusive of B, but B is inclusive of A. So:

*A ⊊ B*

*B ⊋ A*

Group B cannot go to Group A and say ""that is non-canon"" because Group B considers Lore A canon too. However, Group A could go to Group B and say ""that is non-canon"" because whilst they share acceptance of Lore A, Group A does not accept Lore B. **So**, r/teslore allows the discussion of Lore B - that is to say, all lore. Group B can't shoot down Lore A, and Group A can simply ignore discussions involving Lore B and pay attention only to Lore A.

These are simply two generalized groups, but I'm sure we can all use our common sense here. In short, the rule is: Do not tell anyone a piece of lore is ""non-canon"" or ""unofficial"" or any variation thereof, and ignore stuff you don't like, whether you're in the Kult or the [Toddmeri Dominion](http://www.reddit.com/r/toddlore/comments/romhc/the_elk_mistake/). It keeps everyone happy. Also, don't bring up lore authenticity where it isn't relevant.

1375104078.0,65,self.teslore,1j9vsf,The Stone of Snow Throat Theory: Eye of Magnus,IronOxide42,73,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1j9vsf/the_stone_of_snow_throat_theory_eye_of_magnus/,"Warning:  This may get ranty.  I work night shift, so I'm very tired at the moment.  But, I said I would write this, so I am.  I'm actually mainly posting this mostly to start discussion over what the hell the stone is.

So as most of us know, reality in Mundus is held together by the various towers on Nirn.  Each game since Daggerfall has had a deactivating of one tower: Daggerfall deactivated the Brass Tower Numidium, Morrowind deactivated the Red Tower that is Red Mountain, and the events of Oblivion deactivated the White-Gold Tower that is, well, White-Gold Tower.  It makes sense, then, that Skyrim has its tower deactivated somewhere in the game.  If tradition holds, it would be during the main quest.  But nothing in the main quest seems to be an obvious stone like Talos' Oversoul (as Numidium's was), the Heart of Lorkhan (as Numidium's originally was, and Red Mountain's was), or Chim-el Adabal (in the case of White-Gold's).  So, we resort to other places.  I think one item in particular screams powerful magic--The Eye of Magnus.

Firstly, I have heard a few times on this subreddit an original plot for the College of Winterhold that had been dumbed down for development time constraints.  I know not a source, so if someone could link to one, please do.  Anyways, the original plot, according to rumor, was finding that *The Dragonborn* (or at least the PC) is at fault for The Great Collapse.  Basically, The Dragonborn find that he/she did some weird shit with the Eye, causing The Great Collapse *in the past*.  So, The Dragonborn (and the Psijic Order) basically work together to cancel the Collapse, yada yada yada, weird time travel shit.  Now, fucking with time is weird for The Elder Scrolls.  There are three confirmed Dragon Breaks (those little moments of time-fuckery), and two unconfirmed ones.  The Marukhati Selective's debacle, and the first two activations of Numidium are not that important, as we don't know enough to actually examine them.  The important ones (or rather, the ones we have enough information on to actually examine) are the third activation of Numidium, and the casting forward of Alduin.  The third activation of Numidium caused the Warp in the West, which caused five different timelines to converge into one.  The important part here is that Numidium caused it--a tower caused it.  The tower's power comes from its stone.  So, the Dragon Break of the third activation of Numidium was caused by the totem, a stone.  This shows that the stones are *extremely powerful*, and can, in some instances, cause a Dragon Break.  The casting forward of Alduin is worth mentioning because it's the only confirmed instance of time travel we have in the Elder Scrolls.  But, it does show that *it can happen*.  Time travel *does* exist.  Nonetheless, each time requires the use of a very powerful artifact--the heart of a god, the soul of a god, or an Elder Scroll itself.

tl;dr of that whole spiel: Stones can cause (and are one of the few causes of) Dragon Breaks, and a Dragon Break can include time travel.

Secondly, there's Ancano.  Ancano is a Thalmor who, as the end of the College's questline shows, is very interested in the Eye of Magnus.  Now, I and others believe that the Thalmor are attempting to revert back to what they believe to be their immortal forms--Mer were once Et'ada.  It makes sense for them to desire that again.  According to theory, they believe that by deactivating all the towers, they may destroy reality and revert to their immortal selves.  Consider that Ancano, having this end game in mind, sees this immensely powerful artifact that literally radiates Magicka.  It makes sense that he would be interested in it.  In fact, we don't quite know what he's trying to do at the end of the questline.  Perhaps, as I believe, he's trying to deactivate it.  We will never know, because he dies before he can.

Thirdly, there's The Order of PSJJJJ, which is always fun to type.  After the questline, they take the Eye to ""protect it.""  It is important to note exactly what The Order of PSJJJJ is.  Essentially, they are a splinter group of the Altmer that *do not worship the Aedra*.  They worship their ancestors (the non-divine ones...).  They are not interested in returning to the state of the Et'Ada.  In fact, they don't want to.  Of all the groups in Tamriel to know what the various stones are, The Order of PSJJJJ is it, and I feel that they know that the Eye is a stone, and wish to protect it from deactivation.  Quaranir ends up doing this, even going so far as to tell you that the Eye could *destroy the entire world*.

So, my theory as to what exactly happened in the College's questline (or possibly, was to originally):

The Dragonborn finds the eye, and is warned by The Order of PSJJJJ as already happens.  He finds that Ancano had [de]activated (I include the brackets because I'm not sure if he's attempting to activate or deactivate it) the Eye in a different timeline in which he was *not* warned by The Order of PSJJJJ (as the Great Collapse had not happened), and the Dragonborn heads out to stop him from doing so.  He gets to where Ancano is attempting to [de]activate the Eye, and attempts to stop him, killing him.  Quaranir tells you ""Congrats! You did it!"" and takes the Eye to protect it from [de]activation.

So to my understanding, Sithis is another name for Padomay who is responsible for the original creation, along with Anu. Padomay/Sithis is associated with death, chaos, change, etc. and the creation of the Daedra, while Anu is responsible for the opposite and the Aedra. 

The Dark Brotherhood all worship Sithis and refer to him as their ""dread father"". Also, in SKYRIM, the spectral ghost of Lucien Lachance constantly makes remarks about Sithis ""working through him"" and presumably, The Dark Brotherhood. Additionally, from my time playing the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion/SKYRIM, the Dark Brotherhood seem to think that they are essentially Sithis' ""chosen ones"" to carry out his will.

So my question is, with Sithis being this all powerful creator, does he even care about the Dark Brotherhood? Or are they just as worthless to him as some of those fellows standing at various daedric shrines are to their masters?

Next to the Nords, the Argonians are perhaps my favorite player race.  I thoroughly enjoy the concept of RP'ing through Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim as an Argonian with a comletely different cultural mindset.

It's gotten me to thinking about why the relationship between the hist and the Argonians seems to be so one-sided some times. For example, the Dunmer enslaved thousands of Argonians for hundreds of years, and the Hist do nothing, but as soon as the Hist themselves are are in danger (re: the Oblivion Crisis), the Hist turn the Sahxleel into an engine of destruction comprised of hundreds of thousands of homicidal fast healing maniacs. Further, homicidal maniacs capable of going toe to tail with legions of highly skilled dremora, then giving the Rome-in-Carthage treatment to Dagon's very own realm in Oblivion. 

Why is that? Do the hist view the Argonians as a tool? What exactly is the cosmology of the Argonian race, and how does it relate to the Hist? Furthermore, what are the origins of the Hist themselves. Where they a different form of Ehlnofey from what would become man and mer?

Secondly, I posit a theory: The Argonians were indirectly responsible for helping to save most of Tamriel from the Oblivion Crisis. Given how the Argonians were rampaging up and down the Deadlands, I would imagine it took a fairly herculean effort on the part of the Dremora to repel them and then close the gates leading to the black marsh. I would imagine that these gates, being the point of entry into Oblivion for the Argonians, would be deep inside Argonian held ""territory"" during the invasion of Dagon's realm. As such, the Dremora would have had to effectively reinvade these parts of their own realms to deactivate the Sigil stones and close the gates to Black Marsh. 

I would think that the efforts necessary to accomplish this would have significantly detracted from the available pool of forces to invade other areas, thus giving the rest of Tamriel, and by extension the Champion of Cyrodiil, more time to effictively respond to the threat.

&gt; That Molag Bal is allowed his holiday at all hearkens back to a treaty of ancient times, when he reputedly lent his infernal power to the creation of the first soulgems. 

Molag Bal created the first soulgems, The Ideal Masters communicate through giant soul gems.

The Ideal Masters use deception and promises of great power to acquire souls, which lines up with Molag Bals sphere perfectly, and one of the theories of what the Masters do with all of their souls is that they use it as a currency to a higher power, I believe that higher power is Bal.

From my understanding, in Morrowind, there was a ban in trading raw ebony and raw glass by Imperial Decree (East Empire Trade Co. had exclusive rights?), as well as a historic ban on dwemer trade, skooma, and moonsugar. Its been a long time since I've played Morrowind so I'm not exactly sure if that's right. During the period of Skyrim, does it fit lore to ban trade in dwemer artifacts, raw ebony, raw malachite, skooma, moon sugar? Does the empire have the practical authority over trade? Do the people of Skyrim even obey imperial law?

Right now, I have all raw ebony, raw malachite, skooma, moon sugar, and dwemer related artifacts and armors set to a 0 placeholder value, thereby bypassing imperial law as you aren't ""trading"" the items as you get nothing in return.

I'm also changing container inventories to reflect a stronger economy-based class system. I'm estimating that a landless laborer (such as whiterun woodchopper Sigurd) makes an annual salary of 48o septims, merchant 2.8oo septims, blacksmith 3.46o septims, noble (people who don't work at all but own land like nazeem) 11.ooo septims, thane 48.ooo septims, and jarls 96o.ooo for Falkreath up to 2.65o.ooo for Solitude. I plan to adjust the annual earnings against what I can estimate living expenses and deposit the savings into the NPC homes, adding some immersion to would-be thieves.

For example, I have the PROPERTY such as the hunting dog in Markarth at 24o, draft/war horse at 2.4oo, Whiterun home at 15.84o, Markarth home at 32.64o, Solitude home at 94.8oo; LIFESTYLE room rentals from 11 to 2o, a meal of mead and steak at 6, farm clothes at 6, lute at 6o, golden necklace at 2oo, diamond gold ring at 1.8oo, noble robes at 2.4oo, jarl robes at 12.ooo, emperor robes at 24.720; WEAPONS AND ARMOR iron sword (mass produced for all) at 6, full leather armor at 8o, full elven at 2.6o4, full heavy imperial at 3.241, full dragon scale at 45.570.

From what I understand, Skyrim is run on a feudal system (correct me if I'm wrong), and these costs are derived and adapted from 14th century feudal England written records. The salaries were based on recorded peasant salaries, blacksmith guild wages, baron (anglo-thane) salaries, and earl (anglo-jarl) incomes. The lifestyle costs were determined from recorded inventories and tax records. The armor and weapons also from inventories, with full leather armor costing 64 pence, peasant sword at 6 pence, milanese plate armor at 2604 pence, and a knight's full plate armor at 3241 pence.

Do the numbers seem off?

This is concerning the Civil War. I'd like to change blacksmith inventories to include only leather, ingots, basic iron weapons, with massive stockpiles of imperial armor, guard armor, stormcloak armor, depending on the hold. With the exception of the skyforge, all blacksmiths will pretty much only produce armor and weapons concerning the war effort. Is this logical?

Last, regarding bandits. I'd assume bandits would consist of low skilled and poorly equipped peasants and deserters, with much of the more violent sort to joining up with either the legion or the stormcloaks or becoming mercenaries. If I changed most of the bandits to wear clothes (such as the rarely used bandanas and certain clothing) and shoddy iron weapons, with the occasional bandit deserter in full imperial armor / stormcloak armor, does that fit into the lore? I only have bandits to compare to in oblivion with its horrible loot system, so I'm not sure if its more fitting to have poor bandits than armor clad bandits. I'm assuming bandits of Skyrim to overwhelm merchants on the road in numbers, mostly to scare and steal rather than be marauding bandits that raid villages. Any lore of this at all? In turns of in game content, all I noticed was one bandit ambush trap (flipped cart on the road), and one wagon raided by falmer, but ultimately no evidence to violence against civilians.

Argonians, man. Are they haters, or are they lovers? Do these reclusive lizard-men even give a fuck about anyone else, or do they want everyone else to fuck off? Let's take a look at history:

Early records tell that Argonians were already present when the Al*d*mer began exploring Tamriel, and that they lived in the secluded swamp-lands that we now call Black Marsh or preferably Argonia. The province itself has always been relatively peaceful because of the harsh environment and the man/mer-killing deceases. This stopped the large-*scale* invasions back-and-forth that were common in other provinces, but foreigners have still been present in abundance. 

During the First Era these foreigners were mostly pirates, which used Argonia as a base to launch attacks on Cyrodillian merchants. This forced the Alessian Empire to launch an anti-piracy campaign which took the Cyrodillians deep into the jungle of Black Marsh. The Argonians fought back, because of their newly found distrust in foreigners (because pirates, which were the foreigners they really knew, kinda were assholes). The Alessian Empire drew back after the cleansing, however, Black Marsh remained a province of the Empire (though it's worth noting that they only could govern certain pockets close to the coast and boarder). The Empire then decided that it was a good idea to use Black Marsh as a prison for the worst criminals they had...

Now, let's jump to the Interregnum (the period between the 2nd and 3rd Era). This was the time the Knahatan Flu broke out, which I'm sure you've all heard off. If you haven't, then let me summarize briefly; The Knahaten Flu was some seriously lethal and viral shit that could most easily be compared to a junction of the Black Plague and the Swine Flu. This outbreak is important in understanding the Argonian situation, because it had such an immense impact on the province. Everything in Argonia that didn't have scales died, and the flu took a large *bite* of the population of the other provinces as well. The origin of the Knahaten Flu is debated. Some say it was a mutation of one of the many dangerous deceases of the Argonian Jungle, and some say... that it was... **created**... *que the dramatic music*

Supposedly, the Flu was created by an Argonian Shaman to rid Argonia of the plague that was the residential foreigners + be a giant ""don't fuck with us"". But that's simply a theory (or is it?)

In the Third Era, the Empire once again ""conquered"" Argonia, and continued using it as a prison. During this era the Dunmer increased their enslaving of Argonians, so they could work the regions that the other races couldn't endure. Bandit raids into the province increased, and more and more Argonians were enslaved. A slave revolt in Morrowind were retaliated by the Dunmer going even further into Argonia, and also enslaving any Argonian (and Khajiit) that ventured into the Eastern part of the Empire. Now your probably thinking, why didn't the Empire do anything about it, seeing how enslaving any civilized race is illegal? Well, the thing is; it was heavily frowned upon, but the Dunmer didn't really give a fuck, and due to some favorable conditions in their treaty with the Empire, they were to some degree allowed to.

Eventually, slavery was abolished in Morrowind, but the Argonians didn't forget. In the beginning of the 4th Era, while the Dunmer were heavily weakened by the loss of their living gods and the Oblivion Crisis, the Argonians were stronger and more unified than ever. They secede from the Empire, and invade Morrowind. They sack the south of Morrowind, including Mournhold, but are repelled by House Redoran. After the sacking of Morrowind the Argonians draw back into Argonia, and that is the last large event up to present day.


Now, let's summarize: The native Argonians have a very, very bad relationship with the Dunmer, and also a bad relationship with most of the other races. They have a history of being used, which seeds the notion that the other races are either going to

a. use their home as base for pirating 

b. use their home as base for their bandit-ing 

c. enslave them

This leads the native Argonians to fear/hate anyone who aren't an Argonian, because they simply have no recollection of anything else but bad stuff to be the result when their roads cross. I'm not going to speak for the imperialized Argonians, because they might have learned that not all non-Argonians are assholes, but there are definitely in-game encounters that portray imperialized Argonians as reclusive or hostile, as well as the occasional friendly one. So, to answer the question we started with: ***bite*** (at least in Argonia)




Sorry about the profanities. I were just trying to grab your attention. Anyway, this is a small summary over Argonian history, with a little angel to make it lighter to read. I originally wrote this as a comment to the ""Rascism in Tamriel"" thread, and thought it would be a good idea to start a new thread focusing on a specific race that don't get all the love it deserves. As far as I know, ""noobie-knowledge"" on Argonian history is that ""you know, they were slaves to the Dunmer or something"", which is true, but still could be a little more informed. I would love if anyone more well-versed in Argonian lore than me could educate us a little on the fine people of Argonia  *turns the giant X spotlight onto the night sky*",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_1hyqoe,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1hyqoe/to_bite_or_not_to_bite/,
1361719153.0,62,self.teslore,194uhp,On Nedes and Nords,lebiro,68,6,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/194uhp/on_nedes_and_nords/,"Okay people, this is just a very brief ""PSA"" kind of post on an issue which seems to come up quite often and cause some confusion - Nedes, Nords, Bretons and Imperials. Who were they and where did they come from?

Contrary to popular belief (both in Tamriel and in the real world), the Nedes did not come from Atmora, and were not Nords or proto-Nords. To quote eminent scholar of history Hasphat Antabolis (the in-character forum account of developer Kurt Kuhlmann):

&gt; The usual Imperial arrogance. The hoary old ""Out of Atmora"" theory has been widely discredited (no reputable archaeologist would publicly support it these days), but the Imperial Geographers continue to beat the drum of the Nordic Fatherland in the best tradition of the Septim Empire. They seem to think that the imprimature of officialdom gives their outdated scholarship added weight -- which, unfortunately, it appears to in the eyes of the ever-gullible public which continues to snap up the latest Pocket Guides along with the rest of their Imperial Certified pablum. 

There is a very distinct difference. I think the easiest way to explain it is to explain the origins of each of these confusing races.

**The Nords**

The Nords come from Atmora, the cold, frozen continent to the north of Tamriel. In the Merethic Era, the ""proto-Nords"" (ancestors of the modern Nords, following the Dragon Cult), like Ysgramor and his Five Hundred or Thereabouts Companions, sailed from Atmora to Tamriel, where they landed in Skyrim, which they called Mereth (land of the elves).

They did not know that they were not the first men on Tamriel, and neither, apparently, does the Imperial Geographical Society. According to an old text referenced in the [1st Edition PGE](http://imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-high-rock), they first encountered Nedic people (specifically early Bretons) in High Rock. They mistook them for elves and set about killing them until one spoke to them in Nordic.

**The Nedes**

The Nedes were Tamrielic aboriginal humans, or one tribe of aboriginal humans. They were *always* there, not brought from Atmora. The Nedes were enslaved by the Ayleids in Cyrodiil, and by the Direnni clan in High Rock (where they interbred with the elves to become early Bretons). [The Adabal-A](http://imperial-library.info/content/adabal) lists the Nedes as but one tribe of men, alongside the Kothri, the Keptu, the Men-of-Ge, the Men-of-'Kreath, and several others. 

Nedes already lived in Cyrodiil and Direnni High Rock when Ysgramor and co. landed in Skyrim. 

It is my view, due to the way the term is used, that ""Nedes"" or ""Nedic people"", despite really referring to a specific tribe of aboriginal proto-Cyrodiils, is used as an umbrella term for all of these aboriginal races, so the Keptu and Al-Gemha, while not actually of the Nede race/tribe, were ""Nedic people"".

**The Bretons**

The 1st Edition PGE claims Bretons were the descendants of Nord slaves captured at Saarthal, but as Antabolis writes, the PGE is not to be trusted. In any case, the [3rd Edition PGE](http://imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-third-edition-sons-and-daughter-direnni-west-high-rock) perhaps corrects this, stating that ""the Aldmer coming from Summerset Isle were the first to settle and form permanent communities. The early Nedic people who arrived next were stumbling upon a highly sophisticated culture, and were quickly overwhelmed and absorbed"". Of course, the IGS was probably still of the opinion that ""Nedic people"" were Nords, but who knows. 

In any case, yes, Nedes (or ""Nedic people"") came to High Rock, where the Direnni were well-established as a culture, and were absorbed into what became known as the Direnni hegemony. It was these post-absorption ""Manmeri"" that the confused Nords encountered in the Reach.

Nowadays, ""Breton"" is a loose term that describes all the people of High Rock, who despite remarkable cultural similarity (With the exception of the Reachmen), are fractious and sectarian. But back on topic...

**The Imperials**

This is where it is a little more confusing, perhaps because of the central (geographically and politically) location of the Imperials, and their role in shaping scholarship (for instance the bias of the IGS). The Imperials are the descendants of the aboriginal tribes who were enslaved by the Ayleids. These ""proto-Cyrodiils"" were likewise already in Tamriel when Ysgramor arrived, toiling under the Ayleids.

Alessia (/Perrif/Al-Esh/etc.), the Slave Queen, led a revolt of these proto-Cyrodiils against their elven masters. In this endeavour, they had considerable assistance from their new northern neighbours, the Nords (who hated elves due to the Night of Tears and the associated conflicts). Morihaus, the Bull of Kyne, and Alessia's consort, came from Skyrim. When the Ayleids were overthrown (circa 1E243), the Nords and proto-Cyrodiils found that they had essentially inherited the continent, and went on to found the First Empire (not to be confused with the slightly earlier ""First Empire"" of the Nords, referring to their conquests in High Rock and Morrowind). This led to some interbreeding, and a lot of cultural transfer, so the proto-Cyrodiils (now ""Imperials"", I suppose) had a lot of Nord culture and blood.

The modern day Imperials are divided into two broad groups, the eastern Nibeneans, and the western Colovians. Exactly when and how they became distinct is uncertain. It is interesting to note that in the Adabal-A, the Ayleids are said to have "" herded in men from across all the Niben"", so perhaps not the early Colovians. The Ayleids definitely ruled Colovia, however; it is just as littered with their ruins as Nibenay.

**The Redguards**

The Redguards are probably feeling pretty left out, but that's because their relationship to Tamriel's other men is the simplest. Basically they don't have one, that's why they look so different and have such a different culture. The Ra Gada came from Yokuda, a continent to the West of Tamriel. It was destroyed in a cataclysm of debated origin, and in 1E 808, they came to Tamriel in a deadly invasion, brutally conquering what is now Hammerfell. Over time, their need to trade and communicate meant that they effectively lost their native language of Yoku, and picked up many cultural traits from the neighbouring Nedic people.

**The Starry Heart of Dawn's Beauty**

There is one more thing to bear in mind when tracing human ancestry in Tamriel. The [Nu-Mantia Intercept](http://imperial-library.info/content/nu-mantia-intercept) puts forward the theory that ""All mortal life started on the starry heart of Dawn's beauty, Tamriel"".

Now as far as I'm aware, this theory (which most lore scholars hold to be true) does not invalidate what I just spent half an hour typing out. But it does mean, that before *any* of that, everyone started out in Tamriel, and divided in the earliest days of history.

**Conclusion**

So that's that. I hope this helps, and that I haven't made any horrible errors (please point any out).

1355117296.0,62,self.teslore,14l8r9,The Common Khajiit mindset and the assimilation into Tamrielic culture,Mr_Flippers,72,10,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14l8r9/the_common_khajiit_mindset_and_the_assimilation/,"First in this post, I'll be looking at the common Khajiiti mindset as is.

The best way we can understand the Khajiiti mindset is through the Ahzirr Traajijazeri. Of course not all of it, but the introduction is perfectly fine.

First, a direct quote
&gt; The Khajiit mind is not engineered for self-reflection. We simply do what we do, and let the world be damned.

That right there is a very simplistic way of putting it, but it's a good place to base your understanding of it and work up.

To consider this, first take all you understand of people's reflections and their self-awareness of their actions and forget it. The Khajiit do not have it. To put it in a way we could really understand, they ""live in the moment"" so to speak and the concept of self isn't all that big either. It's not a very good term though. The Khajiit think of what they wish to do, then they do it. To structure it, The Khajiit have the what, where, how and when concepts but not the why. The why is irrelevant to them.

Now when I say its irrleveant, I dont mean they have no concept of doing something could be bad. You couldn't tell a Khajiit to jump into a river of slaughterfish who would go do it just because he didn't think it could harm him. It's hard to fully explain the concept.


Now here's where it's going to get harder, explaining the ""simple"" truth
&gt; ""q'zi no vano thzina ualizz"" -- ""When I contradict myself, I am telling the truth.""

I think this could be referring to the Khajiits deceptive nature (which if you don't know is a gift given to them by Azurah. They are able to hide their true nature and intentions.). In this interpretation, when the Khajiit acts outside of his/her intentions they are telling/showing the truth of their thoughts/goals. A basic way of saying this is that, to the Khajiit, actions speak more truthfully than words.

There can be other interpretations for this, but I think one of them that's similar to what I had just mentioned is that when a Khajiit is contradicting their thoughts or preconceived ideas about something, they are exposing the truth to it. I'm not sure how else to develop this interpretation, but think of it as when they lie, they are further understanding the truth that they hide.


A small addition here, the Khajiit have a lesser sense of understanding of morality. Tied in with the premise of not caring/thinking of why to do things or to rationalise their actions, there is no Ta'agra word for ""rules"" or anything similar. The closest thing is ""thjizzrini"" which means ""foolish concepts"". I believe this shows that the idea of living by certain rules is either foolish to the Khajiit or just foreign in nature to them.


Now I'm going to cover the Khajiit mindset that we see more often in TES. First you're probably thinking what's up when the Khajiit so often speak in third person but there's also a number of cases where they refer to themselves as I. I believe this to be the cause of Tamrielic culture (most notably Cyrodiilic) being constantly present around the Khajiit's day to day life. After long enough I believe the Khajiit just use the term I to replace their name in sentences, whether or not they truly think differently about the self is unknown to me. It's suggested that in public around other cultures/people they'll use ""I"" but when in private and with other Khajiit they will revert back to third-person.

I believe that last part can be shown when comparing Oblivion and Skyrim. In oblivion you have several Khajiit who work and live in cities just like regular people and it's in oblivion where I found the most I's. In Skyrim however, it's much different. The Khajiit aren't allowed in ANY hold capitol and thus are less exposed to Nord culture on a day to day basis, making them less used to the concept of I.

Also I remember a particular Khajiit in oblivion who was complaining about the Argonians in the city, she even stated that she refused to drink the town's water because they swim in it. Now, not drinking water because lizard people swim in it seems pretty acceptable, but she goes on to say some downright nasty things, I think she later requests you kill an Argonian on a Thieves guild quest of which you are meant to steal only. She states that they aren't like Khajiit and not even Imperial (this could be interpreted as she sees Khajiit as EITHER higher or lower in hierarchy to Imperials) showing a clear bias. I'm not saying that racism isn't unheard of in Elsweyr but the quote made her seem like she was so deserving, I think a trait picked up from living around Imperials for so long who appear to me to have at least some form of entitlement towards things, at least that a concept of deserving something exists to them and this has negatively affected the Khajiit, altering a part of her mindset.

At first, the Khajiit can obviously be troublesome for outside cultures, resulting in repeat criminal offences or just unacceptable behaviour that isn't known to them but after time they can assimilate into foreign cultures whilst still likely keeping the ideas and base thought processes of the Khajiiti mind. I hope you've enjoyed my post and learned something about the way Khajiit think.

EDIT: I've noticed a link between the Khajiit's lack of the idea of I and the turning of the wheel that creates an I shape inducing CHIM. If you guy's want to make a post about that, go ahead, that's not what I'm here to talk about in this thread.

EDIT: I'm also not mentioning northern and southern mindsets. The title is regarding the common Khajiit mindset, that is what they both share in concepts.

It would've probably took a lot longer without that. Cheers, mate.*

*Welcome back to the seventh volume of 'On the Species of Tamriel'. This one deals with the feline cats of Elsweyr, more commonly known as the Khajiit. These people, ranging vastly in appearance, have enjoyed the interest and fascination of many scholars, along with the disdain of many non-scholars of Tamriel. Without further ado, her is 'The Cursed and Blessed Cats'.*

The Khajiit (meaning 'desert walker' in their own language Ta'agra, in reference to the barren deserts of their home province Elsweyr), are a feline race of multiple forms, often looked down upon by other races, because of their approach to thievery and possession.

There is much to say about the biology of the Khajiit. So much, in fact, that it is hard to point out a common trait among the different subspecies.  
The form a Khajiit takes is decided by the stance of the moons, and these forms range from what would appear as a simple housecat to most, to almost Bosmeri in appearance (calling them such is regarded as a huge insult in Khajiiti culture), to the anthropomorphic cats common throughout Tamriel, to seemingly feral tiger beasts, and everything in between.  
What can be said however, is that most, if not all, Khajiit have some feline traits, be it a slight fur and sharper nails, to the appearance of a cat. Along with this, they all have some form of pointed ears, be it more Mer in appearance, or more feline.  
Even though these fast differences in outward appearance, all Khajiit do share the ability to see better in the dark than the other races can. Along with this, all Khajiit are blessed with the ability to hide their true intention, a blessing given to them by Azura. Along with this ability, Azura also gifted them with an excellent agility, so they are the fastest and best climbers on Tamriel. Along with this, they are rumoured to be the best survivors, especially in their own deserts of Elsweyr.

The origin of the Khajiit is one shrouded in myth and folktales. The Altmer (along with most other races) hold that they were already present on Tamriel since before men and mer came, classifying them as a beast race, along with the Argonians. the Aldmeris epic 'Topal the Pilot' mentions 'cat-demons' in the general area of Elsweyr. It should be noted that only few passages of this story have been remembered, and it is unknown if there had already been some Aldmeri groups who emigrated to the mainland. Furthermore, epics are always a dubious source when it comes to historical events.  
The Khajiit themselves believe they are descendents of the same group as the Bosmer, there neighbours, even though they do not name this ancestor as Aldmer, in stead referring to creatures that change in form constantly (a theme also present in Bosmeri religion).  
According to the Khajiit, all Et'Ada are descendent of the union between Ahnurr (Anu) and Fadomai (Padomay), the chief forces of creation, stasis and change. Out of the first litter came the Et'Ada often classified as Aedra: Alkosh (Akatosh), Khenarthi (Kynareth), Magrus (Magnus, also the only one who isn't regarded as an Aedra), Mara, and S'rendarr (Stendarr). These forces all symbolise the more common things on Mundus, having effect on all life. After this came a second litter, who are generally seen as Daedra: Hermorah (Hermaeus Mora), Hircine, Merrunz (Mehrunes Dagon), Mafala (Mephala), Sangiin (Sanguine), and Shegorrath (Sheogorath). These forces symbolise the more Khajiiti/feline traits, such as the destructive properties of kittens (along with not asking the 'why' question, a common thing for Khajiit), and their addiction to skooma and moonsugar.  
After this, to comfort her firstborns, Fadomai tricked Ahnurr in another union, birthing the moons Jode and Jone (Masser and Secunda), Nirni (Nirn (Mundus was not yet created, but this might be a metaphor for Mundus) and Azurah (possibly a metaphor for Oblivion in general). Ahnurr was enraged, because he didn't want any more children, and mortally wounded Fadomai. She fled and birthed her last cub, Lorkhaj (Lorkhan), in the darkness. This act also created Namiira (Namira). Fadomai, just before she died, told Nirni that she would birth as many children as she did, and she told Azurah the secrets of the Moon Lattice. After this, Lorkhaj tricked the first litter, along with Nirni, to create Mundus. Azurah took some of the children of Nirni (they are described as having no final form) and shape them to the modern day Khajiit. Y'ffer (Y'ffre) saw this and told Nirni of it. She was enraged and created the deserts of Elsweyr, to punish the Khajiit. As a sign of thanks, she allowed Y'ffer to shape some of her children in the Bosmer. Y'ffer also shouted out the secret to surpass the moon lattice, which was vital in keeping the other children of Fadomai out. Azurah kept Ahnurr and Lorkhaj from hearing it, but it did make the role of the Khajiit as protectors of the moons that more important.

Even though this is obviously a myth, there is, as always, a core of truth. The Khajiit do hold a special link to the moons, as their forms are decided by the stance of them, and it is rumoured that the Khajiit did climb up to Secunda at least once. Their link to the elves is also probably more than myth.

Khajiiti politics are vastly different from those of the other provinces. Historically, Elsweyr was divided in sixteen kingdoms. Even though most kingdoms would have fought over territory, the Khajiit strangely did not fall in any major conflict. At some point, the Thrassian Plague hit, and devastated much of Elsweyr and the Khajiit. Only two kingdoms remained: Anequina in the north, and Pellitine in the south. The conflict ended with the marriage of the rulers of these two kingdoms in 2E 309, forming a unified Elsweyr for the first time. The relative peace was mainly kept by the Mane, a almost mythical spiritual leader, who is born when the moons align, and a third moon appears (by the Khajiit seen as the mane itself). This peace ended in the second century of the fourth era, when the mane was murdered and the Thalmor staged a coup d'etat. Anequina and Pellitine were restored, and both became client states to the Aldmeri Dominion.  
As is standard for Khajiit, most of them didn't and still don't care for politics. Khajiit understand that kingdoms and rulers come and go, and feel that the only thing permanent is the sand of the desert. Because of this, they don't believe investing time in power is worthwhile.

This attitude towards things is standard for Khajiit, which attributes to both their perception of a care free race, and their looser understanding of laws and morality. Indeed, most Khajiit are (sometimes wrongly) perceived as thieves. If a house is empty (even if the owner is just away for a moment), a Khajiit might decide to stay there. Not because he won't buy his own place, but because a empty house is of no use, and he might use it just as well. The same thing applies to possession: if it is not clearly stated that it is someone's property, than it is no one's.  
It is important to understand that this does not mean that thievery is accepted by Khajiit. If it is clear that it is someone else's property, it is unacceptable to steal it, unless it is in a case of life or death. Furthermore, taking other's property is only acceptable if it is to the good of the family or clan, as egoistic reasons are despised.

The history of the Khajiit is not extremely well known, and they themselves do not bother with it. As stated earlier, Elsweyr used to be divided in sixteen kingdoms, who were all but destroyed after the Thrassian Plague, forming Anequina and Pelletine, who merged in the united province of Elsweyr. This union remained until the aftermath of the Void Nights, a period in which the moons had disappeared. This was incredibly influential on the Khajiit, as these had huge importance for them. It is unknown what happened to the Khajiiti born during the Void Nights, but it is likely that they were all stillborns. After the moons reappeared, the Thalmor took credit for bringing them back (it is rumoured that they caused them to disappear too), which justified the coup to overthrow the kingdom of Elsweyr, and reinstating the two historical kingdoms. Before the coup, the Mane was conveniently assassinated. Because of this coup, Elsweyr, already outside of Imperial influences since the Oblivion Crisis, in the form of the two kingdoms, became a client state of the Dominion.

I wrote the following on Talos, and I need someone to verify if this is lore-accurate. So, here we go!

**Early Existence as Tiber Septim***

* Before he was the Ninth Divine, Talos was a Nord born in Atmora named Tiber Septim.

* Tiber Septim was raised in Skyrim, where he learned the thu'um. There he was known by the name Talos.

* Eventually, Talos met the Greybeards. The Greybeards prophesied that someday, Tiber Septim would rule over not just Skyrim or Cyrodiil, but all of Tamriel. To do so, however, he would have to head south to Cyrodiil.

* A petty ruler of Cyrodiil named Cuhlecain saw young Talos' potential and appointed him as his general. 

* With Talos' help, Cuhlecain came to rule over much of Cyrodiil. Talos became known for being a ferocious general skilled in strategy and personally easily the strongest of Cuhlecain's soldiers.

* High Rock and Skyrim, who hated the idea of a second Empire, joined forces to destroy Cuhlecain's kingdom.

* The Nords of Skyrim met Talos and Cuhlecain's forces on the field of Sancre Tor, somewhere in Cyrodiil. Yet when the Nords saw Talos, they bowed to him. They knew that Talos was the heir of Atmora and thus the rightful king of Men.

**Rise to Power**

* Still the Bretons of High Rock continued their assault. One night, a Bretonish assassin snuck into Cuhlecain's palace. There he slit Cuhlecain's and Talos' throats and set fire to the palace. 

* It is true that both Cuhlecain and his palace were destroyed that night. But when Cuhlecain's men came to save their king, they found only Talos, his left hand to his neck and Cuhlecain's crown held at his right. Thus was Talos crowned Emperor of Men.

* During this period, Talos claimed for himself the names of Tiber Septim and Ysmir, Dragon of the North.

* During his conquest of Tamriel, Talos used a golem called the Numidium. The Numidium was built by a long-dead race of elves and was intended to be powered with the Heart of Lorkhan, the heart of a dead god. However, Talos did not possess the Heart.

* Luckily Talos had a friend, the sorcerer Zurin Arctus. Zurin was a Shezzarine: essentially, he was an avatar of the same Lorkhan whose heart was used to power the original Numidium. Zurin sacrificed his soul to power the Numidium, becoming the Underking.

* After Talos conquered all of Tamriel, he and Zurin had a disagreement. This disagreement led to Zurin's first attempt at reclaiming his soul, resulting in Zurin and the Numidium's first destruction. Both would survive, but that is another story.

* Talos went on to rule Tamriel for many, many years. After his death, he was succeeded by his grandson Pelagius I.

* Though it is true that Talos was the rightful king of Men, he would someday come to be something much, much greater than an emperor...

**Godhood and others**

* First, you must understand this: Talos *is* a god. The Thalmor's doctrines are *wrong*.  Nearly everyone knows this. The Imperials know it. The Thalmor also know that Talos truly is a god: they are suppressing his worship for a far, far more insidious reason. But that is another story.

* When Talos became a god is unknown. Some say that it was after the attempt on his life. Others say that it was after his death. What is important is that he *did* become a god. That is definitive.

* To understand how Talos became a God, you need to understand both nirvana and the concept of a Godhead.

**Divinity: The universe and a God**

&gt;The extinction of self is salvation; the annihilation of self is the condition of enlightenment; the blotting out of self is Nirvana.

* In nirvana, one transcends the self and becomes one with the universe. He loses all sense of being and achieves perfect harmony and sterility. Essentially, one is born with the concept of ""I AM"". Through nirvana, he eliminates that concept, thus becoming one with the universe.

* In the Elder Scrolls universe, there are lots of gods. From the kindly Arkay to the arrogant Hircine to ALMSIVI the Thieves, these gods come in all colors and all personality types. 

* Furthermore, their existence is definitive. Not believing in them is like not believing in Kevin Bacon: it is simply ridiculous and laughably stupid.

* With so many definitive gods, it's pretty easy to see why there isn't any clear Christianity equivalent. 

* HOWEVER, there *does* exist a concept similar to an all-creating God. This is the Godhead. The Godhead ""dreams"" up all of Nirn, Oblivion and Aetherius: the universe is a part of it and *is* it, essentially. Very few people know of its existence, and those who do-well, let's see later.

* Nirvana also exists within the Elder Scrolls universe. In achieving it, you realize your place as part of the Godhead's dream. You no longer perceive ""I AM"", you instead perceive ""I AM NOT"". Nirvana is known as zero-summing in the ES universe.

* However (again), nirvana/zero-summing is seen through an individualistic perspective in most texts. It is seen as the ultimate failure of existence, the utter and ultimate elimination of something beautiful and unique. In other words, nirvana is a very *very BAD* thing in TES.

* There is, however, an alternative to zero-summing. This is CHIM.

**CHIM: The sacred seal of royalty.**

* In CHIM, you (""I AM"") realize that you are a part of the Godhead. However, you also conclude that by being a part of the Godhead, you *are* the Godhead. Instead of comprehending ""I AM NOT"", you comprehend ""I ALL ARE WE"".

* Fundamental to CHIM is forsaking logic. CHIM is like ordering a birthday cake, having a slice of the cake and saying that you had all of the cake, because you had one slice and the others had all the other slices. (It also sucks that you only had one slice of cake on your birthday, by the way.)

* What does CHIM require instead of logic? Love. You love your own self, and by extension love everyone else because you *are* everyone else (I ALL ARE WE). It is the ultimate form of selfishness, and yet unselfish by nature.

**Talos as a God**

* Talos achieved CHIM. Again, it is not known when. Perhaps it was during his reign, perhaps it was after his death. 

* Why does Talos not intervene regularly? The other eight Divines have the excuse of being weakened by their role as Aedra. Talos is not an Aedra and has no such excuse. Again, let's go back to CHIM. Talos doesn't intervene with mortal affairs because he sees no point in doing so, as he *is* all parties involved.

* Let's take the recent Oblivion Crisis as an example. Why didn't Talos stop  it? He certainly could have, if he wanted to. And if all this CHIM stuff is true, then he has every reason to! He *is* the CoC, Uriel Septim, Martin Septim, Chancellor Ocato, and everyone else involved! 

* That is true, yes. But it is also true that he *is* the Mythic Dawn, Mankar Camoran, and even good old Mehrunes Dagon himself through CHIM. He has no reason to stop himself from harming himself.

* Now as to why the Thalmor want to suppress Talos and Talos' friend Zurin Arctus, well, that's a story for another day.

As Recorded by Atticus Plinius.

*Author’s Note: Raid on Pyandonea, a tale of mythic piracy told in an informal style, is well and truly obscure. Despite my chosen occupation as a travelling scholar, I had never heard it in all my studies and travels until I heard it told in the city of Luftahraan by a local bard, one Timan Amedee. I was immediately enthralled by the tale. After the telling, I approached Amedee and inquired as to where he had learned it. He told me of a storyteller by the name of Yngmir, who had been an elderly man when the bard had only begun learning his craft, and who has since passed on. I traced Yngmir’s history as far back as I could, but found nothing substantial, no hints at the source of the tale. The man had been one of the Marauders—the guild of naval raiders and sailors—even before the guild had settled into its current role as a shipping company. The story certainly has Nordic origins, considering the Nordic origins and occupation of Yngmir himself, as well as the Nordo-centric views and the representation of the Maormer as direct inverses of the Nords within the story. Yet in all my searching throughout the coastal cities that the Marauders once influenced, particularly those on Skyrim’s coastline, I have not found a trace of this specific story. And thus disappears the only path to the discovery of its true origin.*

*This lack of a definitive source places the tale in a dubious light. Its fantastic nature, too, calls into question the story’s validity. However, Nordic tales are known for their fantastic and exaggerated natures; although it is certain that the story is not true in its entirety, there may be some truth in the central plot points. Perhaps an Atmoran fleet truly did circumnavigate Tamriel, stopping at Pyandonea along the way. The possibility of some small measure of truth is supported by the story’s descriptions of Pyandonea, which match with what little we know of the continent. It is unlikely that a man of Yngmir’s education could invent a story that so accurately reflects such an obscure continent. In short, Raid on Pyandonea is either a near-forgotten fragment of Atmoro-Nordic history, or a clever and unlikely modern forgery built upon the local Dreadmund mythos.*


The Dreaded Bomundl Dragon of the Sea, today known as Captain Dreadmund, was a great Atmoran warrior and Ysmir. He came to Tamriel soon after Ysgramor’s Five Hundred, leading a fleet of his own, his Something More Than Five Hundred Companions. But unlike Ysgramor, he chose not to claim land and build cities. Instead, he set out to explore the whole of Tamriel, to find foreign lands and to fight foreign foes. [Dreadmund, in his explorations and battles, was as much a Harbinger of man as Ysgramor, a forerunner of the times to come.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DU203TWhrTE)

To count several of the Atmoran longboats of Dreadmund’s fleet, and their respective captains: Ice-Storm-Veins-Blade-Hammer the Axe captained *Iceberg*, Aldenuekeloch the Thunder Shield Woman captained *Morakein*, Thendwyr Twice-Torc’d captained *Pillager*, and many others captained many others; as a whole, the fleet was too great to account for in swift. By the time of this story, the fleet had even, during its visit to Yokuda, absorbed a pair of strange Yoku ships captained and crewed by strange, dark, unnamed men who could not speak to the Atmorans with words, but who sang with their lust for the slaughter of elves.

Our story begins at nightfall over an oddly violent sea; the southern elven sea, usually calm and kind, rolled and ripped about, angry at the trespass of Dreadmund and his Something More Than Five Hundred Companions. Waves crashed into ships and tried to split hulls, but the raging sea was still more or less kind in terms of the experiences of the Atmorans; the Sea of Ghosts was this violent on a good day. Dreadmund stood waiting impatiently aboard his longboat *Snow Whale* as it rocked back and forth in the waves. He cloak flew back behind him in the wind as though it were a pair of wings, outstretched and ready to carry him into the air. He awaited the return of his Clever Man, Fhalne, whom he had sent to the High Elf city of Alinor to gather hostages for interrogation. They needed more information before embarking on the journey to come.

Aboard the split-tailed *Snow Whale*, besides Dreadmund in all his glowering, spread-cloaked, elf crushing glory, was his Boat-Thane Kehlet the Quick-Eared who could hear whispers leagues away, his Mumbler Hgenral who was an expert of mutter-magic, his oarsmen, Friedrung the Hammer, Oar-Wielding Olad, Jahnson Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Cradle who was brother to Jahnsdotter of Ysgramor’s Five Hundred, Hjaloc, Wulfil, and the one whose only name was Oarsman as he never spoke other than to say six specific sentences which each pertained to his occupation as an oarsman, his three Thu’um-Thanes^1 Thiriul, Thurjac, and Thaduga, and his Beast-Keeper, Mnetnen, who watched over Dreadmund’s pets who were Fiiq the House-Cat, Raving Savage the Welwa, and Tang Mo the Monkey-Thing. There were Dreadmund’s elf-slave translators who shall not be named; the sullen Snow Elf who spoke Atmoran and Snow-Elvish and who had been taken from the land Ysgramor claimed, the clever Bird Elf^2 who spoke Snow-Elvish, High-Elvish, and Bird-Elvish and who wore feathers and who had been taken from the same land while apparently serving an ambassadorial role to the Snow Elves, and the young Sea Elf who spoke Bird-Elvish and Sea-Elvish and who had been taken from a Sea Elf outpost on the continent’s western coastline and who told the Atmorans about Pyandonea and Sea-Elven ships and the like, but who knew nothing specific about the Mist-Veil or the Sea Elf sea serpents—which appear only when Orgnum is near—or anything really helpful about Pyandonea, for he had been born in the outpost and not Pyandonea itself. Finally, there was his War-Wife Vjali, who stood beside him as he awaited Fhalne.

“Where in the blasted seas is he!” Dreadmund growled, more a statement than a question. He clawed idly at the *Snow Whale*’s side, rending tar unto the waves. “He’s late.”

War-Wife Vjali answered, “Fhalne will return, husband. You do not need to worry.”

Dreadmund grimaced. “It’s my duty as Captain to worry. If Fhalne and his men linger much longer, the elves will surely notice them, and that’d bring trouble.”

For a moment, the pair fell silent. The sea roiled and hissed at the fleet, even still, but the ships’ crews kept the fleet afloat. The sun peeked over the spiked waters at edge of the horizon, and set the sea sparkling.

“See? Dawn is coming. If they’re still there, they don’t have the cover of darkness to protect them, anymore. I’m off to fetch them.”

Vjali opened her mouth and made to speak.

“They’re back!” Kehlet shouted from somewhere on the ship, having sighted the warriors aboard the faering before anybody else, being nearly as sharp-eyed as he was Quick-Eared. “They’re in a hurry, too!”

Dreadmund chuckled, a deep, slow, throaty sound. “Guess they did find trouble.” He cleared his throat and Thu’umed so that every crew could hear him, “Weigh anchors and ready sails, we’re leaving!” The waves were frenzied further with his words, and a stray, stormless thundercrack or two boomed through the sky, as happens when the Greybeards call a new Dragonborn to High Hrothgar.

Clever Man Fhalne and those who accompanied him (who were Mjardel, Hoary Child, Ghrojar, Flame-Grin Sorga who enjoyed throwing flasks full of fire at his foes, Jarnhal, Lungaehm, Ben the Bedeviled, Swajfwen, the four High Elf captives that the men had claimed, and Jhunmor who was an expert of elven magic even though leaping magic and mutter-magic and Voice magic were more popular at the time) paddled desperately to the *Snow Whale* and leapt aboard, dragging their faering quickly after.

Fhalne began speaking before his salt-crusted boots had even cleared the gunwale. “We should leave, Dreadmund. Now. We captured those four elves and cut their hands off so that they couldn’t use any of their magic, but I think some other elves caught wind of us as we were leaving. And I’m betting that they’re pissed.”

“You heard him, Kehlet, get moving. Set sail for the south, while we welcome our new guests.”

Fhalne sat, panting. “It really is amazing over there,” he said. “In Alinor, I mean. The city looks like it’s made of diamond. For all I know, it probably is. We should raid it. Attack in the night, burn out their ships, find where they hide their valuables. There’s probably a lot worth taking in that huge Tower, which—”

“Not interested. Let’s interrogate the prisoners; I want to know more about this ‘Pyandonea’ place we’ve been hearing about.”

“But—”

Dreadmund sighed, his breath heavy with early morning mist. “No. We’ve spent enough time in this neck of the sea, raiding these High-Elven Isles and raiding the coasts of their elven cousins on the big continent. We’re off to kill something new.” He scraped a bone from between his teeth. “Now let’s have a chat with our guests.”

***

Most of their guests didn’t have much to say. One was a drunk who had been wandering around the docks looking for whatever High Elves drink, one was in charge of numbers, or something, and had been speaking to the third captive, a sailor from one of the crystalline ships docked in the harbor. The fourth refused to speak at all, so he died first, thrown overboard to flail in the water, handless and hapless. The one in charge of numbers died second because he knew nothing about Pyandonea, and the drunk died third, thrown overboard after telling the Atmorans some incoherent story about the Sea Elf King Orgnum marrying a princess from a city called Sunhold. The sailor was actually helpful, though, so he got to live the longest.

He spoke of the Sea Elf raids that came to the his Isles so often. He spoke of their ships with bug-sails and bug-hulls and serpent skin for rope. He spoke of their tactics, and of the many ways they were known to board ships, destroy ships from afar, and trick unwary Admirals. He spoke of the sea serpents themselves, who only came with the strongest of the Sea Elf fleets, the fleets led by Orgnum. In battle, the serpents would dive underwater and rise beneath High Elf ships, wrapping around them and crushing them. He told the Atmorans, too, of the mists that the Sea Elves commanded.

They conjured mists wherever they liked, cloaking ships and distracting enemies. They even had a Mist-Veil^3, which cut their land from the rest of the world; it separated Pyandonea from the Isles, from the big continent, and even from the vague land called Aldmeris.

***

The Mist-Veil loomed ahead. It blocked any view of the true horizon, and stretched to the right and left farther than even Kehlet’s eyes could see. It was impenetrable, impossible, colossal. With all their magic, the High Elves had never pierced it, and as of today, they never have.

The Atmoran fleet stayed its course, unshaken.

“Mist-Veil’s ahead! Thu’um-Thanes, clear the skies and clear our path! Mumblers, mutter us some full sails, to compensate for the wind we’re ripping out of them!”

And all the men on all the ships of Dreadmund’s fleet heard his booming Thu’um, for the Thu’um was always the quickest way to relay orders to a an entire fleet, and they scrambled to obey. The muttering of his Mumblers became a babbling stream and the Thu’um-Thanes ran to the bow of each longboat and the ports and starboards of the fleet’s sidemost and Thu’umed a chorus-like-thunder. As one, the great fleet cut into the Mist, and was soon engulfed by it. The Clear Sky Thu’ums warded off the Mist, lending the fleet a bubble of clear air and allowing the Atmorans some breathing room. [The Atmorans pushed onward, with nothing but endless Mist in sight.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=W3DiENnA3gw#t=66s)

***

“We’re coming out of this Mist!”

Dreadmund, aloft over the *Snow Whale*, looked overhead and saw the sky and sun for the first time since they had entered the Mist-Veil. Since then, the sun had climbed halfway to its zenith. He cast his eyes downward and saw it his objective just ahead. Pyandonea; hostile cliff faces jutting from the sea, each crowned by abundant green, jagged, unwelcoming rocks that warned sailors away and strange, obscuring mists that hid much of the land from sight. And speaking of sight, not a single safe harbor or kind beach was in sight. It looked like they’d have to do a little searching.^4

Kehlet approached and echoed Dreadmund’s thoughts. “Captain, shall we search for a place to drop anchor, and maybe establish an outpost?”

“Go ahead.”

Kehlet rushed off, barking orders at the *Snow Whale*’s crew. Dreadmund grinned. This land seemed hostile, but Dreadmund was certain that he could tame it, or at least some of it for a time, as he had so many other lands.

And then a fleet of strange ships shot from behind the closest islands. Their hulls, which were of myriad colors from blacks to greens to [garish rainbows](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_NpNmHxRciRU/TSJSB3zIJFI/AAAAAAAABlk/1uEwwjuN-vg/s1600/iridescent+beetle.jpg) to yellows to whites, seemed to be the unbroken shells of massive beetles, and the sails seemed to be the wings of the same, a single pair of rising from the deck, straight up with a slight tilt. The decks were built of green-tinted wood, probably with rooms built of the same below deck. The rigging and other ropes were the white, tightly coiled skin of whatever sloughed off of the Pyandonean serpents, as the Sea Elf had told them. The fleet announced its presence with the bugling of Pyandonean trumpets, like a snake’s hiss but sharper, shriller, piercing.

And then Dreadmund’s grin became a smile, and his smile grew wider and wider until it became like that of a hungry shark, teeth long and sharp and ready to devour, and he laughed aloud. “Get ready for battle!”

The strange fleet—the Sea Elf fleet—was preceded by a vanguard of serpents of all colors, some mounted by elves, some not. The multihued glimmer of not only the scales of the serpents, but of the iridescent beetle-shell hulls and insect-wing sails of the ships, made the Sea Elf fleet seem as much a rainbow as a threat. The elves even wore bright, colorful dress, distracting the eye from the dismal pallor of their skin, as white as pure snow.

Suddenly, the line of serpents charged forward, ripping through the water.

One serpent, a blue one which matched the color of the sea and wore short, curved horns, sped ahead of the rest, spanning the distance between the fleets in the space of a hiccup. It dived under the waves, and a moment of eerie stillness passed before the creature shot up from the water, writhing and coiling itself around the *Snow Whale* two times over. It reared its head and bit at Dreadmund, who caught hold of its fangs, both twice the length of a horker tusk. Dreadmund tore out the right fang and used the other as a lever to push the serpent’s head to the deck. He stomped his foot onto the creature’s lower jaw to keep it steady and drove the serpent’s loose fang into its right eye. It shrieked, shaking planks and weapons and teeth. Kehlet, with his Quick-Ears, passed out.

“Jahson, Hjaloc, Lunghaem, Savage! Chop this thing up while I’ve a hold on it, and clear the deck!”

They jumped at his command and began hacking. It spasmed against the deck, and tightened its grip on the *Snow Whale* in its pain. The ship groaned as the serpent shrieked again and again. They cut through where its coils came to the gunwale and the serpent’s shrieks grew louder again, earsplitting and dizzying. As coil after coil was severed and pushed over the gunwale, the serpent’s cries subsided. The last thing it saw was Dreadmund’s horned shadow playing across the deck. Dreadmund shoved its now bodiless head off the deck.

The rest of the Atmoran fleet hadn’t fared so well; though the blue serpent had been the swiftest, it certainly hadn’t been the strongest. While Dreadmund and his crew had been fighting, the strongest serpents had been tearing apart ships, and even forcefully dragging them down.

But Dreadmund did not have time to help them. The Sea Elf fleet was fast approaching, and the groaning, injured *Snow Whale* turned to meet it.

***

The Atmorans won the battle.

At the onset, Dreadmund Thu’um-Called a Storm and the Thu’um-Thanes of the other ships followed his lead. In retaliation, the Sea Elves summoned a mist storm, which the Thu’um-Thanes could not clear away without clearing their own Storm as well, and all became a chaos of lightning flashes and indistinct shapes. The Atmoran ships rammed into Sea Elf ships, Thu’um-Thanes grappled with serpents, Sea Elves charged with their skin alight with violent, rapidly changing hues, a strange distinction from their usual pallor. In the end, the Sea Elf fleet was driven to retreat, half of the fleet dodging behind and between islands in flight after the other half sank to the bottom of the sea. The losses of the Atmoran fleet were not nearly as grievous; only a quarter of Dreadmund’s fleet was felled. The Sea Elf fleet was stronger than any naval force the Atmorans had yet faced, or would face, but it still fell before them.

Dreadmund led a shore party of forty and set up camp on the one tiny strip of beach they could find. Four faerings’ worth of fighters; Captain Dreadmund, Boat-Thane Kehlet Quick-Eared who had woken up soon after the battle, Clever Man Fhalne, War-Wife Vjali, Oar-Wielding Olad, the three elf-slave translators, Raving Savage the Welwa, and Beast-Keeper Mnetnen of the *Snow Whale*, Captain Thendwyr Twice-Torc’d, Boat-Thane Ysnulson, Ghemek, Bright-Eyed Khem-li who enjoyed throwing Dwemer cylinders full of light at his foes, Hermal, Jjarkel of Tongs, Kaewyn who used the curved swords of the Yokudans, Aariul, Witch-Wife Aldvira who was married to herself, and Vrenduga the very small karstaag-man of the *Pillager*, Captain Orvar the Wheezing, Boat-Thane Ra’Kaash, Dralsar the Salmon, Tusk’ut’en, Jorn-mora, Wizard who just liked being called Wizard, Sulemeldart, Argan One-Ear, Stehnz the Master Architect, and Lug of the *Arch-on-Water*, and ten men from the remaining Yoku ship, the other having sunken during the battle.

The shore party’s camp was rushed at best, and served little purpose other than to establish a small base of operations to raid the Sea Elves from. A place to hide their loot, too.

A Sea Elf rose from sea, alone and boatless, and approached the camp on the shore. The Atmoran and Yoku warriors swiftly dropped what they were doing, drew their weapons, and trained them upon the elf, but he calmly made noises and then the Sea Elf translator made noises and then the Bird Elf translator made noises and then the Snow Elf translated, “Lower your weapons, I would have words!”

The warriors ignored the elf’s words until Dreadmund waved their weapons down; they did not trust the elf-slaves, and so always awaited Dreadmund’s decision in regards to the elf-slaves’ translations.

The Sea Elf saw Dreadmund’s motion and met his eyes, identifying him as leader. He made noises again, and the elf-slaves made noises in turn. “I am the King Orgnum of the Maormer. Who are you, leader of the foreign fleet?”

“I’m the Dreaded Bomundl, Captain of the longboat *Snow Whale* which flies through the seas and brings the snowy joy throughout the world, and leader of the great Atmoran fleet that you met in battle. Pyandonea is mine, now.”

The elf-slaves made noises in turn again and when the Sea Elf translator finished speaking, King Orgnum smiled and made noises again. He continued making the noises, and the Sea Elf translator did not begin translating. Dreadmund frowned and glanced at the Snow Elf.

“What’s he saying? Why aren’t you three translating?”

The Snow Elf stared at him, confused. “He’s laughing.”

Dreadmund growled and drew his sword. “See this blade? It’s called the Ice Blade of the Monarch. It was made to kill a king. The specific king is dead now, and not by this blade. But you’ll make a good alternative, so the Ice Blade can still fulfill its purpose.”

When the words, thrice translated, reached Orgnum’s ears, the King’s smile turned into a grimace. His thrice translated response was, “You would like to fight? I was hoping to persuade you to leave, but I accept, only on the terms that we fight as tradition dictates: we shall fight on the shore, knee-deep in the sea. Do you accept my terms?”

Dreadmund nodded.

***

Dreadmund and Orgnum stood ten paces away from one another, knee-deep in the sparkling, sun-punished sea. The sun stood at its zenith, glaring down at the Ysmir and the Orgnum. Dreadmund stood in full battle attire of tough mail, horned helm, clawed gauntlets, and swirling cloak, as always, and held the Ice Blade of the Monarch aloft with a single hand. Orgnum stood in casual clothing, entirely unarmed and solemn. His tongue flicked between his lips. Dreadmund wondered why Orgnum chose not to bring a weapon to their duel, but he had left his elf-slave translators on the shore along with the others—and, in the end, he really didn’t care.

Dreadmund gripped his blade in both hands and charged, howling. Orgnum wriggled his fingers and three forms rose from the water, bulging and thinning into [humanlike shapes](http://www.djsyczylo.net/works/humanform/blowaway/blownaway.jpg). The things flooded forward, hoping to slosh down Dreadmund’s throat and drown him standing up. Dreadmund cut through the nearest one, and where the Ice Blade touched it, its water froze. He hacked at it amid a mad torrent of flying water, frozen chunks sloughing off with each slash, and the thing collapsed. Dreadmund spat out a mouthful of water; though it hadn’t managed reach his lungs, the creature had managed to fill his cheeks. The second one leapt into the air, graceful, hoping to spill down Dreadmund’s throat as he stood unawares. Dreadmund cut through it lengthwise as it leapt, and it broke apart. The third crashed into Dreadmund as a wave, and he fell into the water, dropping the Ice Blade. As the thing gathered itself again such that it could slip down Dreadmund’s gullet, and Dreadmund Thu’umed the moment before it touched his lips. His Thu’um froze it unto ice, and it fell.

Dreadmund rose and looked back to Orgnum, and his eyes widened. Snake-magic! Orgnum was a great Serpent, larger than any in the battle, with white scales and blank eyes, staring at Dreadmund. His fangs dripped with venom whiter than his pure snow scales, his leering eyes were full of malice, and his coils rolled through one another like slow ocean waves. Dreadmund glared into his eyes and saw power behind them, power like his Thu’um. Orgnum was a powerful opponent, and Dreadmund was not exactly sure that he could match him. The damned wizard had hidden it earlier, but Dreadmund saw it now.

And Orgnum would see Dreadmund now, for Dreadmund was Bomundl, BO-MUN-DU’UL, MOVE-MAN-CROWN, the Dragon of the Sea who was Crowned as an Ysmir, the Crowned Man who Flew through the world on the back of a snow whale, on the back of the *Snow Whale*. He crouched to the ground on all fours, wings-as-arms and legs gripping into the ground with hooked claws. He whipped his long, spiked tail back and forth. He spread his fanged maw wide and Thu’umed, but Orgnum dodged aside. Orgnum writhed up to Dreadmund and coiled around him, bending his wings-as-arms to his body and stealing his flight. Dreadmund clawed and bit at Orgnum, to no avail. The two rolled into the sea, twisting and clawing and biting and Thu’uming and shrieking.

***

War-Wife Vjali gritted her teeth in anger. She had just watched her husband die. She was shocked, and angry, and mournful. She hefted her axe into the air and looked about, as if looking for something to kill, preferably an elf. Unfortunately, none were present—besides the elf-slave translators, but they were still needed—for the Atmorans had taken no prisoners during the initial battle. That was for later.

Without an elf to behead for some small solace, she went on to do what needed to be done.

“Everybody aboard the faering! We’re going to search for my husband!”

***

As Vjali and those who accompanied her in the faering rowed out, the sea suddenly grew violent, as if angry at the Atmorans as it had been before the crossed the Mist-Veil. Dreadmund, bearing Orgnum’s corpse in his arms, burst out of the water and into the air. The violent waves of his emergence shoved the faering aside and nearly submerged it, but those aboard it, as well as those aboard the longboats in the distance, ignored the waves and watched in awe as Dreadmund, in flight, sank his fangs into Orgnum’s carcass, ripped out his heart, and flung it north-east into the horizon with a mighty flick of his long neck. Then he dropped Orgnum into the sea. And then Dreadmund fell and landed in the *Snow Whale*’s faering. Those aboard the faering sat agape, staring in awe, awe that he had survived.

He looked up, grinning. [“I think we’re here to stay.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr0NBPRMe2E)

***

A month later, Dreadmund and his followers had adapted to the land of Pyandonea and claimed a bloody,  chunk of it as their own. At first, their outpost had been a mere camp on a beach, but it had grown and it was alternately called Smallwall and Narrowwall (for the wall was too small to be called broad, and the beach was too narrow to ever hold a broad wall). At first, they knew nothing of the land, but they stole the oracle bones of Hermium who was a friend of the Sea Elves and who the Atmorans hated as though he was an old enemy. From the oracle bones, they learned to navigate the reaching kelp without being caught (which, luckily, they had not encountered during the initial battle) and they learned to effectively fight the Sea Elves and their sea serpents, to successfully raid and pillage their towns and villages. They learned that the huge beetles the Sea Elves used to build ships lived in the jungled interiors of the islands, though the Atmorans rarely saw them and never fought them, for they hated the jungle. They even learned some Sea-Elvish: words for insults, words for battle cries, and words for ordering the Sea Elves they captured about.

They had learned, too, that there were as many kinds of serpent as there were kinds of dragon. Though the sea serpents—who were lesser—could not do thus, many of the serpents could, more or less, Thu’um with their eyes. The most common examples were those serpents that shot jets of fire, streams of frozen wind, or both from their eyes (but never both at once, of course). There were serpents that could drain men’s vitality with a glance, serpents that could Stare men unto stone, serpents that could Stare men’s weapons out of their hands, serpents that could look somewhere and move there in an instant, and on and on.

As the Atmorans explored further and further into Pyandonea, the islands packed tighter and tighter together, until some branches of the sea looked more like canyon rivers than ocean waters. They found waxy octopus elves, a giant who howled “Ilyadi” and who was like the karstaag-men except that he had more eyes, beaked reptiles with domed shells, and a wide variety of bizarre fish. They also found a great many rewards for their exploration: a shield that struck those who beheld it with fear, a flask that made the imbiber briefly immune to magicka, a sword which spread the injuries of a single enemy to all nearby enemies with each cut, and a chest filled with gold which, if emptied, refilled by the same time the next day. Those rewards have different names today: the first was called Fearstruck before it was destroyed, the second was called the Flask of Something-or-Other, the third disappeared even before it could be named, and the fourth was dubbed Orgnum’s Coffer.

And we can’t forget their raids on the cities of the Sea Elves, where they claimed those treasures and captured Sea Elves as Stuhn had taught them. The cities ranged from a city built of beetle shells to a city of mixed High Elf crystals and Wood Elf plants, from a city of  of ships, bridges, and scaffoldings afloat at sea to an underground city swarming with serpents. The Atmorans raided them all, one by one, and stole from them amid chaos and violence.

There were rumors among the Sea Elves, extracted from those that the Atmorans captured, that the King Orgnum was gathering a fleet to push the Atmorans out. The Atmorans told them that Orgnum was dead, and they agreed, but insisted that he was also gathering the fleet and that they should flee. In response, the Atmorans simply shrugged, assuming that the Sea Elves were just nuts or that maybe Orgnum had turned himself into some sort of Draugr-Mage, or that he had escaped through trickery.

***

Dreadmund’s fleet set out at dawn. The *Snow Whale*’s crew was as it had been at the beginning of this story, with the exception of Flame-Grin Sorga, Jhunmor, and Thaduga, who had all stayed behind at Smallwall, Raving Savage the Welwa, Tang Mo the Monkey-Thing, and Jahnson Whose-Name-Stays-in-its-Cradle, who had all died in agony of the poisons of local foods and creatures, and the Snow Elf and Sea Elf elf-slave translators, for the Bird Elf, the cunning linguist that it was, had by now learned enough Atmoran and Sea-Elvish to become the only translator Dreadmund needed.

Their target was a small fishing village off of one of the northwestern islands, whose villagers brought in all kinds of sea life: fish with translucent skin, sharks, fish with orange and white stripes, eels, underwater birds with spearlike tails, really long fish that looked like eels or sea serpents but really weren’t, and fish that, when looked upon head-on, look like the faces of screaming men. The fisher-elves even caught the occasional Haus, which were creatures with the front half of a cow and the back half of a serpent and which were said to be the cattle of either the octopus elves or the people of a Republic called Hahd. The dwellings of the village were made of coral, like those of the Slugs of Thras, and the town was completely defenseless. The town had next to nothing worth the taking. Nothing besides the fish. The Atmorans certainly weren’t going to go fishing for themselves, especially when they didn’t know which fish would kill them and which wouldn’t.

***

“Captain, shall we sail through the gap between the islands, or sail around?”

“Cut through the islands. We don’t have all day.”

“Yes, Captain.”

The *Snow Whale* pushed ahead, and the cliffs of each island loomed in until only one ship could pass at a time. The space was dark; the only light was that which trickled between gaps in the overhanging foliage that crowned each island. The rest of the fleet followed, entering the crevice one at a time. The cramped, dark, musty space made the Atmorans somber, and all was silent but for the lapping of trapped water on the bare cliffs and on the ships. The silence whispered into their ears and pulled at the edges of the splashes and the creaks of the waves and the ships, threatening to devour even those sounds.

A ship appeared ahead of the *Snow Whale*, cutting out of the vague murk and into the filtered sunlight. It was of a clear amalgamation of elven styles: its elegantly curving wooden hull and deck, patterned with shards of crystal, depictions of Sun-Birds and ancestors engraved throughout, screamed of High-Elven design. The traces green-tinted wood which broke the perfect swirls and even coloring marked local repairs to the ship. A perfectly shaped leaf, alive and green, served as the sail as its stem served as the mast, like the living sails of the Wood Elves in those ships that they grow. Faded text played across the ship’s side. Dreadmund turned to his Bird Elf, which, nervous, preened its feathers and rearranged its magic beads.

“What’s that text on the ship’s side say?”

The Bird Elf squawked. “It reads, ‘the *Pasquiniel*.’”

The *Pasquiniel* sliced through the stagnant waters, spurting green-flecked froth, and the crew of the *Snow Whale* stood transfixed by it. A lone Pyandonean trumpet called, tones rising and falling, just as sharp and shrill and keening as every such trumpet the Atmorans had heard during their time in Pyandonea.

The Bird Elf, who had also learned to read the messages hidden in the alternating tones of Pyandonean trumpets, declared, “They would like to speak to you, and negotiate something.”

Dreadmund grunted. “It’s probably a trap, but we can’t avoid it. Move forward.”

***

As the two ships neared one another, a Sea Elf on the *Pasquiniel*’s bow, [glass-tipped](http://www.kiwitreasure.com/Prodimages/AA01/Taiaha-maori-spear-head.jpg) spear in hand, shouted ahead. To Dreadmund, most everything of Sea-Elvish was still nothing but incoherent noises, but he did pick up one word.

“Did he say ‘Orgnum’?”

“Yes-Yes-Yes. He said that he is the King Orgnum. And that he would like to duel with you, with the condition that you leave Pyandonea and take your fleet with you if he wins.”

Dreadmund frowned. “Tell him that I killed Orgnum.”

The Bird Elf babbled at the Sea Elf, and the Sea Elf babbled in return. The Bird Elf turned back to Dreadmund. “He says that he agrees that you killed the King Orgnum, but he insists that he is the King Orgnum.”

“Ask him what in Hell that means.”

“He says that he is the new the King Orgnum, that because the old one died he was chosen. He says that the one you killed had lived much longer than he was supposed to, so there were a few in reserve. He says—”

“Translate directly, foolish thing!”

“‘I am the King Orgnum, as chosen by the Hooded Elders who live below the World-Bowels-Tree and the Hooded Serpent who lives in the roots of the same. I climbed down through the jungles to reach the Tree after being Stare-Called by the Elders themselves. I am Serpent-blooded as you are Dragon-blooded. [I will defeat you.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCrkUqp9DMA)”

“Heh. What do I get out of dueling with him that I don’t get from just killing him?”

The two elves made sounds for a moment. “You shall be granted the *Pasquiniel* without resistance, and you shall have a time of respite before the next King Orgnum challenges you.”

A lazy smile played across Dreadmund’s face. “Odd how eager he is to be crushed. I’ll humor him. But the last Orgnum chose where he would fight me, so this time I get to choose. We’re fighting aboard the *Snow Whale*.”

***

Dreadmund and the second Orgnum, the second Serpentborn, stood across from one another on the ship’s deck. Dreadmund readied the Ice Blade of the Monarch, which he had recovered after his battle with the other Orgnum, and this new Orgnum readied his spear. The Ice Blade still hadn’t tasted a King’s blood, but maybe it would finally get its chance. Dreadmund stared into Orgnum’s eyes, and Orgnum Stared back.

Orgnum charged. Dreadmund tried to move, to react, but he realized that he was frozen in place, slowed by the Stare, for Orgnum knew it as the serpents did. A Thu’um rose from Dreadmund’s frozen throat and pushed Orgnum back, breaking eye contact and freeing Dreadmund’s movement again.

Orgnum Stared a gout of flame, which erupted from his eyes, and Dreadmund Thu’umed the same. The flames crashed together and hissed.

Dreadmund spoke another Thu’um from the side of his mouth. It landed beside Orgnum, and there he was, bringing the Ice Blade down upon the elf.

Or not. Orgnum shoved his spear haft in the way, and Dreadmund’s blade cleaved straight through, cutting the spearhead from the rest of the shaft. Orgnum twisted out of the way of the blade like the Serpent he was at heart and he grappled with Dreadmund, dropping the shaft of his spear as Dreadmund dropped the Ice Blade. There wasn’t space to use spears and greatswords, anymore.

The two rolled across the deck, Thu’um deadlocked with Stare, and Orgnum's hand desperately grasped for a weapon, for a coincidental savior. His seeking fingers found the severed spearhead. He held it aloft and brought it down with all his strength, shoving it into Dreadmund’s chest.

Dreadmund gasped. It hurt him to breath. Orgnum stood and backed away, face triumphant. Insolent elf! Dreadmund began a Thu’um, but before it could leave his lips as a honed weapon, it burped from his side. He screamed in agony. The elf had stabbed into his lung. He Thu’umed again, and again, and as the Thu’ums burped from his side, his wound grew wider and wider. He gave up his Voice as a lost cause; his greatest power made powerless. He rose. He would not fall to this cur. He charged, howling, and made to smash Orgnum in the face, to gouge out his eyes with his claws, to kill him anyway. Orgnum glared daggers at Dreadmund—literally—and Dreadmund was flung back. He tore one of the daggers from his body and charged again, armed now with more than his claws and teeth, and Orgnum Stared lightning at him. Again, and Orgnum Stared him unto ice. Again, and Orgnum Stared at Dreadmund with such force that he flew into the *Snow Whale*’s mast and split it. Dreadmund did not rise this time.

He spoke in hissing Sea Elf tones, and the Bird Elf translated from the side.

“He says, ‘Do you surrender? Do you accept my demands? Will you leave, and take your pink men with you?’”

Dreadmund roared and rose again, and Orgnum Stared agony into his wounds. Dreadmund fell. He was breathing in only quick, painful gasps now.

Between gasps, he answered, “I...accept. We will...leave.”

The Bird Elf spoke, and Orgnum nodded.

Footnotes

1 Pronounced ‘Thoom-Thanes’ by Amedee, which indicates either archaic spellings and pronunciations within the story, or ignorance on the part of Amedee or on the part of an earlier teller of the story, such as Yngmir. I spelled it as ‘Thu’um’ with each mention, for the sake of adherence to accurate, or at least modern, spellings. The Thu’um is the more specific, accurate word referring to the Shouts and Voice of the Tongues of Skyrim in Skyrim’s early years.

2 The term ‘Bird Elf’ presumably indicates an Ayleid, considering the attachment the Ayleids had to avian imagery. ‘Heartland High Elf’ was likely too clunky a term for Atmoro-Nords to smoothly use in storytelling, and it was nonsensical too, considering that these Atmorans did not encounter the elf in Nibenay. ‘Wild Elf’ is a nonsensical title for the Atmorans to use as well, considering that this story’s setting, whether the story is historical or fictional, predates the fall of the Ayleids and their descent into ‘Wild’ness. And finally, the term ‘Ayleid’ is simply too technically correct for the Atmorans to use; to them, the elves were Snow Elves and Bird Elves and such, not Falmer and Ayleids and the like.

3 The ‘Mist-Veil’ is fairly mysterious. Different sources hold different views; it is clear that, for the last five hundred and twenty four years (as of 4E 201), the ‘Mist-Veil’ has cut Pyandonea off from the rest of the world. Older sources dictate that the Mist-Veil (‘The Veil of Mist’) once cut Pyandonea off from Aldmeris, with no indication of separation from the rest of the world. As a whole, it is clearly evident that the Maormer have some control over the mist storms that are some common in and around their land—with one source going so far as to claim that certain herbs and magicks of the Maormer made one feel like a ‘cooling mist’ during certain, ah, recreational activities—and it seems that they have traditionally used their ‘Mist-Veil’ as a barrier and an alarm system. Such a view is clearly supported by the text of Raid on Pyandonea.

/r/teslore was created by letstrythisagain81 as a place for civilized and meaningful TES lore discussion, and it has and will continue to serve this purpose fantastically. This is in no small part due to the subscribers here, particularly the regular posters. But our subscribers have been rising quite quickly as of late, and with that comes the inevitability that the content on the subreddit will slip in quality and away from the subreddit's purpose.

It's in the interests of myself, the rest of the Elder Council, and I'm sure many of you, that this does not get out of hand, and /r/teslore stays the quality community that it is. It hasn't been happening too much, I'll admit, but we want to stamp it out before it begins. So, we'll be toughening up in our moderating responsibilities in that threads and posts we deem unfit will be removed.

Some might consider ""stupid"" questions to be unfit, but I realize this is quite a gray area. As such, threads that are obviously jokes will be removed, threads that ask questions answered in the [upcoming revised] FAQ will be removed, and anything else judged unfit at our discretion will be removed. If it's not obvious it should be removed, it is not a ""stupid"" question and will not be.

Know that joking in general won't be forbidden, because it's fun - as long as it's in good taste. We've never had trouble with that before, so I don't see any reason for us to put an outright ban on jokes. Only threads that are jokes will be removed.


Also remember; TES lore =/= TES games, and /r/teslore has always put an emphasis on this. Game *lore* discussion (such as DLC speculation and the like) *is* allowed, but posts that stray too far into game stuff will be deleted. Also, threads asking for help with the background of their game character will be removed if they are guilty of this also.

Repeat offenders of any of these new rules *will* be banned from the subreddit.

Of course, some of all this lies in your hands. Never be afraid to downvote where appropriate. Conversely, upvote quality content. Refer to the newly revised voting guidelines in our sidebar for assistance. If you see a comment or thread that you think should be removed but hasn't yet been dealt with, report it and we'll look at it at the soonest possible moment.

Additionally, send a message the Elder Council (or any single one of us, if you'd prefer) if you have anything you'd like to say or suggest. If you're a regular around here (we know who you are), we take your word as seriously as we take each other's.

With Reality TV.",desquire,67,8,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1eoc68/clearing_up_all_the_godhead_confusion_with/,"Alright, ya know what grinds my gears? All the confusion and misinformation about the Godhead. I apologize for sounding crass, but it's getting out of control. The Godhead has gone from a *very* thinly veiled *idea* of how the universe of TES began to a near-sentient character within the lore. This is not correct. There is almost **no** real information on the Godhead. Why? Well, because it is irrelevant. What follows is a VERY simplified analogy.

Think of the universe as a house. A super rich, anonymous benefactor purchases this infinitely large mansion, burns the deed and invites whoever wants to move in, ala The Real World reality TV. This benefactor DOES NOT LIVE THERE.

Loads of crazy, excelectic, idealistic and weird people move into the house and make rooms of it their own, their areas reflecting their own personalities and habits. Some are super messy, others OCD freaks. Some are violent and try to kill the others for more space, even though there's plenty of empty space elsewhere. The Real World house is a chaotic torrent of conflicting personalities, buddy-pacts and back stabbing all the win the grand prize. Whats the prize? Nobody knows, but they want it. Oh, and as the house gets larger and the contestants leave food out all kinds of ants and other tiny, insignificant vermin move in. Some of the vermin praise the contestants like gods for an extra crumb of sweetroll.

A few of these contestants, most a bit more level headed then the rest and some blatantly misinformed, decide to combine their areas to make a more peaceful place to be. A place that represents enough combined habits, good and bad, to be congenial to all of them. And thus, the common room is formed. 

You can see where I'm going with this, but my main point of this ridiculous analogy is: After everything that has happened, all the contestants who live in and run the Real World house, what does the person who initially bought the house and burned the deed matter? He doesn't. He doesn't live there, he doesn't control the house and he no longer owns it. It belongs to those who have made it home. The Godhead isn't the head of the gods. Or a being dreaming the world. Or any of the other bad writing that has been spread throughout the internet. It became irrelevant to the lore immediately after it's role was played.

Oh, and the guy who bought the house? He was a non-sentient rock. Or a sweetroll. There was a clerical error at town hall.

So, lets just never mention the Godhead again.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_1eoc68,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1eoc68/clearing_up_all_the_godhead_confusion_with/,

I decided to post this here and not on the ESO reddit because we're looking specifically for Elder Scrolls lore-lovers. A lot of this is in response to ESO's representation of the altmer and Summerset Isle which even Michael Kirkbride hates. 

Taken from the official Elder Scrolls lore forums on the Bethesda website:

Don't read too much into it, it's all for fun. I am not a musician, and not much of a poet, so don't be surprised to find that some of the rhyme and rhythm is... well, a bit crap. I tried.

The tune would be basically [The Devil Went Down to Georgia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDm_ZHyYTrg) (upon which this is all based), only on a lute, if you can imagine that. Colovian lutists are... uh... really good. I imagine a Colovian accent (for this purpose at least) somewhere between the original Georgian of the song, and the English West Country... if you can imagine that.

Also, yes it should technically be ""The Daedroth went to Colovia"", but I can't really hear that on a Colovian tongue.

*Enclosed is a transcript of the most widely-accepted lyric to ""The Daedra Went to Colovia"", a popular folk song of the West Weald. Of course, the exact tune and words can vary significantly from player to player,  but typically, this old tale of Clavicus Vile is one of the most consistently recognisable songs in the region. Its frantic pace and ambitious chords are testament to the skill and unique tastes of Colovian musicians.*

.

Old Man Vile was feastin’, a-sittin’ on his throne

Sucking up some hapless ghosts and crunchin’ on their bones.

But Old Man Vile was greedy and his belly growled on still

for every scrap of every soul could not that belly fill.

So the Daedra frowned and stamped his foot and looked further afield.

Old Man Vile with Daedra smile went walkin’ in the Weald.

.

And there he spied with Daedra eye young Kastav at the lute.

He knew this was the soul for him, his huntin’ might bear fruit.

He said “here boy I see you play, and rather fine I grant,

But tha’rt no Daedra, that’s for sure, and play like me you can’t!”

Old Man Vile’s a wily one and Kastav brash in youth.

“Old Man Vile,” young Kastav said, “I’m the best an’ that’s the truth!”

.

“Yay very well,” said Old Man Vile, “I’ll make a bet with you.

Play your lute and play it good and if you’re boast is true,

You’ll win my lute o’ solid gold, but if ye prove a liar, 

I’ll take thy soul right back with me to roast upon my fire!”

.

“Why that lute’s fine” said Kastav brave, “I’ll hang it on my wall,

When my song’s best and yours is less and you win nowt at all!”

Old Vile just laughed and snapped his claws and held the lute of gold

It hissed and spat and thunder roared and Vile struck these chords bold:

.

*Instrumental*

.

“Old Man Vile I’ll tell you what, your playin’s pretty fine

But I told you once that I’m the best and that there lute is mine!”

.

*Instrumental*

 .

With that the Daedra groaned, and began to stamp his feet,

He roared with rage and smote the earth for he knew that he’d been beat.

Old Man Vile did not lose well, and snapped his bloody claws 

And to him came his mighty hound, a lute held in his paws.

The hound did growl and split apart and turned all into scamps.

Each held a lute of blackened wood and they began to dance.

.

*Instrumental*

.

And Kastav frowned and on the hill he drummed his booted feet

And the ghosts o’ Kastav’s blood cried out “By Hrol, Lord Vile’s a cheat!”

And the Wealdmen brought their ghostly lutes and Kastav played again.

Now just like Vile instead of one, young Kastav played as ten:

.

*Instrumental*

.

And this time even Old Man Vile had to admit defeat.

“Kastav boy, come take my lute, I know when I am beat.”

So Kastav took that lute o’ gold and said “don’t come again!

Old Man Vile you know your place, and this is man’s domain! 

I’ve beat you once, I’ll beat you twice,” and when all that was said.

He swung the lute and knocked the horns right off of Old Vile’s head!

.

But no prize o’ Vile’s is as it seems and Kastav didn’t know.

He was brave and rash and played that lute right then and there and lo!

Those razor strings o’ solid gold would play no mortal score.

They cut poor Kastav’s fingers off, he played the lute no more.

**Player:** ""The Emperor. The real Emperor. Where is he?""

**Amaund Motierre:** ""You mean after all that's transpired, the Dark Brotherhood will still...honor the contract? Why, this is astounding news! Wonderful news! The Emperor is still in Skyrim, but not for long. He's aboard his ship, the Katariah, moored offshore in the Solitude Inlet. But you must hurry! If you can get aboard that ship. Kill Titus Mede II, as contracted...I will reveal the location of the dead drop that holds your payment.""

I don't think that it's beyond reason that Amuand would take a similar precaution, in his last dealing with the brotherhood. Given that some players did in fact carry out the task of killing Amaund, his worry would be completely founded.

It's impossible to post a ""gist"" of this, but basically it means that there was an initial past that through CHIM was changed to be a past the Ruling King liked. Such as Vivec changing his history to have the origin story in the Sermons, despite being born initially just a normal elf. Or Camoran meddling with his ancestry.

Or, say, Talos de-jungling Cyrodiil, and the not-jungled Cyrodiil seen far prior to his time in TES:O.

**BEFORE** you mash the downvote arrow and yell at me for daring to mention that blasphemous name, hear me out.

Vivec was born a mere elf. He achieved Divinity through the Heart, and made a history of himself that was so much more. He was Vehk the Mortal and Vehk the God, twice Vehk. Vivec.

Thus, he was always born from an Egg, visited by Almalexia and Sotha Sil, etc. etc. etc., and yet was born as a normal elf as well.

So suppose Talos did something similar to Cyrodiil, for his Red Legions because he loves them.

Cyrodiil was initially jungle (just as Vehk was initially normal), but after CHIM was made to be always temperate (just as Vehk has always been deific).

The temperate nature of Cyrodiil shown in TES:O isn't a mistake. The dev who said it was a ""transcription error"" is right for the wrong reason.

Courtesy of Talos' CHIM-interference, Cyrodiil has always been temperate. This usurps it having always been jungle. The two are both knowable, just as we know Vivec's mortal origins, but his deific origins as seen in the Sermons take priority over that.

So, yeah. I kind of just solved our problems with temperate Cyrodiil far preceding Talos. Talos made Cyrodiil always have been temperate over it having always been jungle, and what we see in TES:O will reflect that.

It's commonly accepted that the last Dragonborn is the PC, and that he is the only one who can save the world. But how true is this? A lot of us take book lore at face value, but I believe it's time to see things with the Occom's Razor. The last Dragonborn? Or the Last Dragonborn left? In the final fight against Miraak, he boasts how the heroes of Sovngarde looked to him to defeat Alduin. Miraak alone seems like quite a fitting candidate to take on the world eater. Power to control Alduin's forces, limitless number of shouts, a dragon rider, the power of Hermaeus Mora's wrath, the list goes on.

So something came to my mind recently. The last Dragonborn almost gets his head chopped off at the beginning of the game. Surely, if Alduin was one second late, Dovahkiin would be dead. But it seems just so conveniently, Miraak is getting out of Apocrypha. From the looks of things, it seems that the tale didn't care so much for the Last Dragonborn, but more so the last living Dragonborn in the Kalpa.

As we know, Dragon culture is very simple, kill someone better than you, you take their place. It's easier to wear the crown when the king has no head. What if Miraak was just a test for the Dragonborn, a sort of obstacle to see if the Dragonborn was strong enough for Alduin? What if Miraak was a contingency plan if things went to shit? What if Akatosh pitted these two together and let Dragon Priests be Dragon priests, just to quickly decide who was going to take the place as the last Dragonborn? Miraak has all the things needed to take down Alduin. In fact, Miraak could very well fill the role of the Dragonborn in almost every aspect (ends the civil war, finishes off the silver hand, stops the situation of the eye of Magnus, destroys the Dominion, etc.). In fact, one could go so far as to say that Miraak is even a better candidate than the Dragonborn. He could skip half of the entire MQ if Alduin happened to be in Sovngarde. If Miraak succeeded in killing the Dragonborn, he could mantle his place and get things done, just like he did with all the other Dragon priests.

 Correct me if I'm wrong, but Hermaeus Mora is the Daedric Prince of knowledge, born from the unused ideas of creation. If this is true, then couldn't every single play-through be an unused idea of creation being played out, and therefore a part of Hermaeus Mora? What if each time a PC starts out on their journey, they are simply performing one of those possible unused ideas? If HM knows all knowledge of TES, then he knows all possible actions and each play through is the actualization of one course of possible actions.

And what's more than that, aren't all of us on r/TESLore, engaging in the exact acts Hermaeus Mora wants us to? All of us are trying to learn the hidden knowledge of the Elder Scrolls universe; all of us are digging deeper and deeper and getting lost in the search for knowledge. It is this very search for lore that is exactly what HM says happens to those who get lost in his realm. 

Because of this, I think HM is the most powerful and meta character in TES. Every time you try to learn about the lore of the universe, you are really participating in just such a search as HM wants. And going even deeper, we are all spending real life time learning about HM and the other Daedric Princes and this knowledge is with us as we go about our real lives. In some small way then, this knowledge becomes actualized in the real world. 

It reminds me of Neil Gaiman's ""American Gods"" where a god's power comes from those who believe in them or even just know about them. This is actually pretty close to Richard Dawkin's memetic theory that ideas are real and self-replicating. The more we know about HM and the more we dig into the lore of TES, the more ""real"" and the more powerful HM as an idea becomes in the world.

1350866948.0,58,self.teslore,11vcrs,When the Dreamsleeve Runs Dry,Ishullanu,63,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11vcrs/when_the_dreamsleeve_runs_dry/," The Dreamsleeve is a difficult subject of speculation, even though it is likely that all those speculating on it have at least once been through it before. It is rare to find reference to the Dreamsleeve and its function, as many mages use it merely has a conduit for coded communication and wipe their hands of any further investigation. Despite this lack of formal documentation, certain fringe groups have contributed information on the Dreamsleeve topic, such as in the [Mythic Dawn Commentaries](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/mythic-dawn-commentaries).The opening of those commentaries states “We mortals leave the dreaming-sleeve of birth the same, unmantled save for the symbiosis with our mothers, thus to practice and thus to rapprochement, until finally we might through new eyes leave our hearths without need or fear that she remains behind.” This excerpt has been interpreted to mean that this dreaming-sleeve (or Dreamsleeve as it is more commonly phrased) is the place that all mortal souls must pass through when first entering Mundus. Scholars have expanded this further, coming to near consensus that the Dreamsleeve is also returned to upon death. Here, it is theorized, that the souls of the dead are purged of their memories and attachments, and re-enter Mundus unburdened by their former life. So this process assures the continuation of mortal life, while simultaneously giving the souls of men and mer chances to transcend the limitations they built up through past mistakes. Though this function is enormously valuable to mortals, the Dreamsleeve could be involved in something even bigger, with its continuous use being tied to the eventual fate of the Kalpa.

 It is clear that not all souls go through this process of recycling and rebirth in the Dreamsleeve, there are many documented examples of mortal souls reaching alternative realms for a continuous afterlife. The realm's of Oblivion are filled with the souls of those who make deals with the Daedric Lords, eternally in service one way or another. The Nightingales of Nocturnal becoming one in the Evergloam. The lycanthropes and other bestial hybrids, endlessly switching between predator and prey on Hircine's Hunting Grounds. The other Daedric Lords are known to engage in similar agreements, sheltering mortals in their respective realms (or at least harvesting their souls in some way), over time these souls removed from the rebirth cycle will begin to add up. It is not just the Daedra that are involved with this removal from the Dreamsleeve cycle, the Nordic Sovngarde is an eternal drinking hall for the Nordic heroes if their death earns them a place there, and the Redguard's Far Shores could function in a similar way. The fact that souls are being recycled implies a finite overall supply, a supply that is being siphoned out into the daedric realms and other afterlifes, eventually halting the flow of souls through the Dreamsleeve and back into Mundus. With the Dreamsleeve dry, Mundus would become an empty plane of existence, and the souls of mortals would be static in their various eternal resting places. What would be the point of Akatosh protecting a world that can no longer progress? The desertion of Mundus would remove any attachment the Time-God might have with the current Kalpa, likely convincing him to allow Alduin to begin his World Eating. 

If we accept these postulations on the connection of the Dreamsleeve and the continuation of the current iteration of reality, the question becomes twofold, ""Is removing oneself from the Dreamsleeve cycle to be desired?""and ""Why are certain forces pushing towards the reduction of the Dreamsleeve's soul supply?"" Let us first examine the issue of escaping the Dreamsleeve’s cycle. It would appear from a casual look that the Dreamsleeve exists as additional chances to live ones life, giving mortals endless opportunities to find immortality. So on the surface, attaining immortality through the power of the Aedra and Daedra appears to be the point of the cycle, giving individuals time to find which realm will hold their soul until all souls are sorted and time comes to a close. Unfortunately this view is short sighted, as this definition of immortality does not consider what transpires when the current Kalpa comes to a close. For it is clear that when the world is devoured, the mortal souls that make their home in other realms are not exempt from Alduin's hunger. As he showed when traveling to Sovngarde and feasting upon the Nord dead there within, at the end of the Kalpa all mortals will be consumed, regardless of if they are in Shor's realm, Mundus, or the numerous pits of Oblivion. Alduin’s world eating could be seen as an extension of the Dreamsleeve, gathering up all of the souls and destroying the world to restart the process again in the next Kalpa. Taking this into account, the Daedric realms and mythic worlds for the dead do not offer the preservation of the self, but a postponing of cycle of rebirth. As stated in the sermons of Vivec[ “The enlightened are those uneaten by the world”](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-twenty-one), meaning to truly escape the cycle, an individual must fully reach enlightenment, achieving true divinity themselves and not relying on the powers of other gods. Anything less than true transcendence unto Godhood is a failure of the purpose of the Dreamsleeve. 

Now if it true that the collection of souls into other realms is what depletes the Dreamsleeve, spurring the end of time, it is important to examine the agents behind this movement of souls. This could give insight into the unexplainable, glimpsing at the motivation of the Daedra and their reasons for hoarding mortal souls in their realms of Oblivion. It has been speculated that the Daedra could move past the ending of a Kalpa, since if the spheres they represent are eternal (betrayal, ambition, revolution, madness, and ect.) then the Daedra themselves are necessary to embody them forever as well. In addition to this, many of the Daedra champion change, they could yearn for the changing in reality that comes with the end of a Kalpa. There is a distinct possibility, keeping all these factors in mind, that the Daedra take steps to hasten the end of each Kalpa, robbing the Dreamsleeve of its waters, ferreting away as many souls as they can.

Though the Dreamsleeve continues to be frustratingly opaque, yielding few of its many secrets, clearly it is worth further research. Providing opportunities for mortals to reach divinity, maintaining the amount of souls present throughout a Kalpa, and its drying serves as the catalyst of the world’s end, it would appear that the Dreamsleeve is one of the most important forces in existence. Is it the responsibility of mortals to keep the Dreamsleeve flowing, to ignore the temptations of the Daedra and other promises of eternal happiness, and focus on repeating the life/death cycle until  enlightenment can be reached? Or is the drying of the Dreamsleeve a natural phenomena, and mortals should embrace whatever afterlife they wish until the Kalpa comes to a close?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1352452458.0,,Winterhold,True,t3_11vcrs,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11vcrs/when_the_dreamsleeve_runs_dry/,

Since the second era, there have always been three words guaranteed to strike fear into people’s hearts: The Dark Brotherhood. Supposedly led by ‘The Black Hand’, these fabled assassins were responsible for the murders of thousands of innocents, and perhaps some who were not so innocent. But, what happened to this organisation of legend? Since the beginning of the 4th era, the cult has drifted away into a thing of legends. Now at the coming of the dragons, it was as if they no longer existed, until the death of the emperor. I hope to explain how the Old Dark Brotherhood completed its final contract… itself.

First, let me explain the Dark Brotherhoods concept of ‘purification’. The idea is that to ensure the safety of the Dark Brotherhood, the 5 tenets may be forgotten, and an entire sanctuary sacrificed to Sithis to ensure any traitors are killed. I believe the fall of the Dark Brotherhood is simply purification on a massive scale.

The end began during the final years of the third era, nearly 200 years ago, around the time of the Oblivion Crisis. The Dark Brotherhood was betrayed from within by one Mathieu Bellamont. Lucien Lachance, a speaker for the cult, murdered Bellamont’s mother, creating within Bellamont a deep hatred for the assassins. The idea of revenge built up inside of him, until he eventually came up with his plan to destroy the one who gave the order for his mother’s death: The Night Mother.

Bellamont joined the cult and rose up the ranks. He created masses of paranoia within the cult by getting assassins killed, resulting in the ‘purification’ of the Cheydinhal sanctuary by a Silencer, a high ranking assassin for the Black Hand. Bellamont then began secretly switching the Silencer’s jobs so that he would inadvertently kill many members of the Black Hand. Eventually, the Silencer was confronted by Lucien Lachance, who told him about the jobs being switched. After finding the lair of Bellamont, but still unbeknownst that that he was the traitor, The Silencer returned to Lachance, only to find him dead. Bellamont convinced three other speakers and the Silencer to go with him to Bravil, where the Night Mothers tomb was. Here, Bellamont began the final part of his plan, murdering two of the speakers and attempting to kill the Night Mother. He was instead killed by the Silencer.
These events are what started the downfall of the Dark Brotherhood. With many of the Black Hand dead, and the Cheydinhal sanctuary wiped out, the Brotherhood was weak. However, more importantly, Sithis’ wrath was incurred. Bellamont broke all 5 of the tenets in his betrayal, leaving a dark mark upon the Brotherhood. He dishonoured The Night Mother by attempting to kill her immortal body, he betrayed The Dark Brotherhood by causing the death of members of the Black Hand, he replaced jobs given to the Silencer and therefore indirectly disobeyed orders and in this way he also stole The Silencer from the Brotherhood. Finally he killed many Dark Brothers and Sisters. 

Sithis and The Night Mother knew that this sort of betrayal could easily occur again and that to ensure the Dark Brotherhood could be great once more; it had to be destroyed and rebuilt via the purification of every Dark Brotherhood sanctuary.

The 3 main ways the Dark Brotherhood was eliminated were: The Great War, infighting of the Black Hand and Falkreath Sanctuary. The Great War was the most problematic for the cult, as it resulted in them losing many sanctuaries, including every base in Hammerfell and Black Marsh. The Night Mother most likely did not cause the Great war, but instead did not protect the sanctuaries in anyway and allowed them to be destroyed. The destruction and evacuation of so many sanctuaries eventually led to Black Hand becoming divided. Some wished to expand the Brotherhood, whereas others wanted to protect what few sanctuaries were left. Neither side understood that the Brotherhood’s days were numbered, and that nothing could prevent the will of Sithis and the Night Mother. 

In 4E 187 only 4 sanctuaries remained: the Cheydinhal Sanctuary in Cyrodiil, the Wayrest Sanctuary in High Rock, the Corinthe Sanctuary in Elsweyr, and the Falkreath Sanctuary in Skyrim. The Wayrest sanctuary was destroyed by Corsairs, and the Corinthe sanctuary was evacuated to Cheydinhal. The Falkreath sanctuary abandoned the other sanctuaries, believing that the other sanctuaries were doomed, and only a new Brotherhood not bound by Tenets and the Night Mother’s will could survive. When only one member of the Cheydinhal sanctuary remained, the keeper of the Night Mother, Cicero, took her to the Dawnstar sanctuary, knowing that the Falkreath sanctuary had given up on the old ways. The Night Mother drove Cicero insane with her silence, ensuring he would assist in the death of the final sanctuary: Falkreath. Cicero then took the Night Mother to the Falkreath sanctuary.

By the Night Mother’s will, a new member was recruited by the Falkreath Sanctuary, who she made listener. Astrid broke all 5 tenets, thereby sealing her own fate, as well as the fate of her Sanctuary. The Blade of Woe she possesses is most likely stolen from another Dark Brother or Sister. She then dishonoured the Night Mother, by at first ignoring her order to seek out Amaund Motierre. This also broke the 3rd Tenet, by ignoring an order from her superior, the Listener. She broke Tenets 2 and 5 by betraying the listener to Commander Maro, and trying to get them killed. Commander Maro finishes off the Falkreath sanctuary, killing most everyone. The listener finished the purification, by killing Astrid after the attack, thereby destroying the final fragment of the Old Brotherhood. 

Finally, the Dark Brotherhood was reborn and could once again strike fear and death into the innocent Men and Mer of Tamriel.

I recently discovered that the game I spent so much time on in middle/high school was far deeper than I had suspected. I have been replaying it for the last few weeks--taking the time to invest myself in the texts. It's truly an example of artistic merit in gaming. This will be my second post on this subreddit, so please feel free to correct me on any mistakes.

Inspired by our own [Prince-Of-Plots](http://www.reddit.com/user/Prince-of-Plots)' pat-on-the-head encouragement, I'd like to take a stab at answering one of the seemingly infinite questions brought up by even a casual reading of MK's mythopoetic ramblings. 

&gt; What gives the mythic archetype of ""the Prisoner"" so much power? Where does it stand in relation to the King/Rebel/Observer?

Or, straight from the devil's mouth:

&gt; what in the Aurbis makes the Prisoner such a powerful mythic figure?

 To understand the importance of the Prisoner, we must understand the importance of the Tower. 

According to [Vehk's Teaching](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tower), the Tower holds the secret to CHIM. The tower is representative of the barrier we face in our journey to realize our potential to say ""I AM"" in the face of the alien terror that is God. 

The Tower is the fourth constellation, and the Thief is the third. The tower is a place to keep things, crown jewels, prisoners, secrets to apotheosis, all things a Thief would be interested in. The Thief could be any average J'oe born under a certain star, seeking enlightenment, trying to break into the Tower. 

The Prisoner, however, is born to uncertain stars. The Prisoner is someone locked in the tower with CHIM, whose fate is their own to decide. They have the potential to become a ruling king, due to their freedom from the stars. 

If CHIM is a walking path (out of the godhead, into reality), and the Prisoner is imprisoned within the secret of the tower (CHIM), then we could say that the Prisoner is imprisoned within reality.

 Escaping the tower means that the Prisoner is seeking freedom from reality. Escapism. Fantasy. We are all Prisoners. 

But the Prisoner knows reality exists, and is thus predispositioned to learning the secret of the tower, without being constrained by fate to follow a certain path, other than the one they choose through their actions.

The Prisoner is the Thief, but one step ahead.


+++

As to it's standing in relation to the King/Rebel/Observer, I must admit I had to do a bit of research to even know what those concepts referred to! 

I believe they are entirely unrelated. The Prisoner may occupy any of those roles or none, due to his or her inherent lack of predisposition.

1360344956.0,54,self.teslore,1853lh,A Look at Vvardenfells Noteworthy Creatures,Undoer,64,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1853lh/a_look_at_vvardenfells_noteworthy_creatures/,"I'll just start off by saying: This is all written in character, and most based on observations and dialogue found in Morrowind (though a bits from Skyrim). It's set before the fall of Baar Dau, and just after the Nerevarines arrival on Vvardenfell. The only book source I've used that comes to mind is [this](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Unnamed_Book). From here onward is all in character. 

**A Look at Vvardenfells Noteworthy Creatures by Arnand Duvier.**

First, please allow me to introduce myself, I am Arnand Duvier, currently in the employ of the Mages Guild of Tamriel. I am the author of many books, essays, and articles on the indigineous species of Vvarndfel, such as “Cliff Racers And How To Avoid Them” and “The Observed Relationships Between Kagouti And Alit”. During my most recent excursion to Vvardenfell I came across some very bewildered tourists in both awe and fear of the wild life which they'd never seen before on Tamriel, it was then that I decided to do two things: Firstly, join them in unadvancing towards the angered Betty Netch and secondly, write an essay on the most surprising and noteworthy animals that can be found on the island of Vvardenfell. 

**Alit**

I shall, in most typical fashion of many publications, proceed in alphabetical order, and we shall start with the aforementioned “Alit”. The Alit is a two legged creature in appearance with razor sharp teeth that dominative the mouth of the beast, which in turn dominates the body. The Alit appears to be a cumbersome and slow creature, but in actual fact can reach high speeds and catch even the most seasoned researcher by surprise. Due to it's lack of forelegs it attacks prey primarily with it's teeth and maintains good balance whilst attacking, despite it's appearance. 

The hide of the Alit can be tanned to make a tough leather, and is frequently traded by the Ashlander Tribes of Vvardenfell. It also holds many magical qualities that can be used by seasoned alchemists for a wide range of potions, poisons, and elixirs.

Alit's are frequently found around the grasslands of Vvardenfell and the Ashlands.

**Cliff Racer**

Perhaps one of the most infamous creatures of Vvardenfell is the Cliff Racer, a carnivorous flying beast that terrorizes all of Morrowind, rather than just Vvardenfell. The winged menace has also been sighted on the Eastern borders of Skyrim. Although it is rumoured that their population has been dropping as of the 3rd Era 427 (The date of this publication being 3rd Era 428, 13th of Last Seed) Cliff Racers are still in positively frightful quantity. 

The most impressive feature of the Cliff Racer is the length of the wing span, which appears to be around 1.5-2 meters, I regret to inform readers I have never stood around one long enough to measure it's wings. Another striking feature is the long tail, which is presumably used to maintain balance whilst flying, or potentially whilst hunting, since the creature appears to be carnivorous.

The Cliff Racers plumes are often found available in the Imperial City's many market places, and are available from alchemists for their 'levitation' properties and numerous other shops for their more aesthetic qualities. 

**Guar**

Guar are the pack animals of Vvardenfell, and the mounts of the Dunmer who see horses as a meal, rather than a noble steed. Guars are similar to Alit in many respects, such as their very strong back legs which support the entire body, and their large heads which dominate much of the creatures appearance. In contrast to the Alit, Guar are herbivorous, and easily trained to serve the native Dunmer rather than hostile, this is probably due to the beasts rows of razor sharp teeth. 

The Guar is easily distinguished from the Alit by several huge differences: Primarily, it's skin tone is a much lighter shade, making it easier to spot at a distance (and potentially run away from), secondly it has seemingly useless but rather interesting small arms, and thirdly it has a long thick tail protruding out of the creatures nether regions. 

The Guars thick hide can be tanned into a leather that is frequently found all over the Empire. These hides a major export of Vvardenfell. Ashlander tribes have been known to farm packs of Guar, presumably for their hides.

Guars can be found all over Vvardenfell, and this is probably due to their adoption by the Dunmer, considering how similar creatures such as Kagouti and Alit stay mostly to the grasslands and ashlands. 

**Kagouti**

Kagouti are the Alit's stronger brother, and share many resemblances with their brothers, but very few with the Guar.

The Kagouti, like Alit, are aggressive carnivorous beasts (This researcher recommends the use of Levitation magics to avoid Kagouti whilst studying them) who dominate the grasslands and ashlands of Vvardenfell, presumably preying on the herbivorous creatures found around the area. 

The main difference between Kagouti and Alit are the tusks which protrude forward from where cheeks would be on a Man or Mer and the two sharp fangs rather than lines of fearsome teeth. This may sound preferable, but due to the Kagouti's fast running speed it can be crippling, if not deadly, to be caught by a charging Kagouti. The Kagouti's charging abilities are aided by an eye ridge that allows it to charge without fear of damaging it's eyes. 

Similarly to it's brothers, the Alit, and cousins, the Guar, the Kagouti also has a valuable hide, but it is in shorter supply than Alit and Guar hides due to the Kagouti's significantly more ferocious and dangerous nature. The hide is said to be tough and valuable leather for fittings and armours.

**Kwama**

On my journeys around Vvardenfell I once met a miner, and I asked him where he works, believing there were no valuable ores or stones in the area, and I was right, much to my surprise the man explained that he, like most Miners on Morrowind, mined for Kwama Eggs, a staple of the Dunmer diet. There are many subspecies of Kwama, ranging from small slug like Foragers to the great queens. Kwama Eggs are used in a vast range of dishes due to their size and abundance, and are cooked in combination with Mudcrab Meat (which can also be found on the island) and Nix-Hound meat to create two unexpectedly tasty dishes. 

The Forager, smallest of the subspecies (except perhaps the Scrib) is unduly aggressive for it's size. It is, as aforementioned, a small slug like creature with a beak and three black, menacing, evil eyes. I shudder to think about the beast, and as I write this I figuratively tremble (If I trembled no one would be able to read my writing) as I think of the 'Kwama Cuttle' which the Forager produces at alarming quantities. It is a thick waxy substance that is produced from the Kwama's beak and has modest magical properties such as a resistance to poisons.

The Kwama Scrib is the larval form of Kwama, a small ant like creature with a white chitin exoskeleton and six legs. Although the Scrib is not a very dangerous critter it is, like the Forager, unduly aggressive for it's size, and, unlike the Forager, produces a weak Paralysis Poison from within it's body.

The Kwama Worker is one of the species few non-aggressive subspecies, and will only attack if provoked (or it's queen is harmed). The Worker does most of the work around a Kwama mine by digging tunnels for the Queens eggs and attending to the Queens needs. Unlike many of Vvardenfells beast the Kwama has a rather ordinary number of legs, four to be precise, a number of legs befitting most non-sentient beings. 

The Warrior is my personal least favourite form of Kwama. It is aggressive, and unlike the Scrib or Forager, it is appropriately aggressive to its size. The Warrior's job within the mine is to protect the queen from invaders, such as researchers and miners. The Warrior excels at it's job using it's powerful front arms which can shatter wood, bones, and the resolve of Bretons. 

The Queen is the central figure of the mine, and what all Kwama mines over Vvardenfell revolve around. The Queen is a huge monstrosity of a creature that lays eggs through a huge egg sac protruding from it's rear end. The Queen, despite appearances, is not hostile in it's nature, and will not attack anyone unless attacked, but it is heavily guarded by the dutiful Kwama Warriors which are not quite as welcoming to visitors, regardless of how important a blood sample is. 

**Netch**

Netch are the main cattle of civilized Vvardenfell and are a magnificent sight to see. The Bull (Male) Netch is the larger of the two very different genders and has a thick hide that covers a sack of jellyish substance known as the “Float Sack”. The Float sack, found on both genders, is a sack of magical vapours that keep the majestic beast afloat as it soars gracefully over the ground. 

The female, or Betty Netch, is the more aggressive of the two genders, and has an external float sack that moves with the Netch. The Betty Netch is much smaller and lighter skinned compared to the Bull.

Whilst in the wild Netch herd in ratios of 1 Betty and up-to 8 Bull, but in captivity the ratios are kept closer to one to one in order to raise conception rates. This causes the Betty Netch to be much more hostile in captivity than it would ordinarily be in the wild. 

Some Bull Netch have known to display poisonous qualities when threatened by prey, or their flesh is improperly ingested. 

Netch are farmed for their valuable leather which surpasses Guar Leather in it's quality. 

**Nix Hounds**

Nix Hounds are canine predators who hunt in packs all over Vvardenfell. Whilst the Nix Hound is quite large (and one of the few quadrupedal creatures on Vvardenfell) it lacks a strong way of attacking it's prey, but it makes up for this by numbers and speed. 

The only valuable part of the Nix Hound is the meat, which can be found on the dinner table of many Dunmer. The meat when prepared properly is one of the most filling meals a researcher could hope for after a long day of cataloguing seashells. 

**Shalk**

Shalk are insects which can be found on Vvardenfell's grasslands and ashlands. The shalk is said to be very resistant to fire, and rumoured to have lava flow through it's veins by some Ashlander myths. The Shalks resistance to (and rumoured use of) fire is met with a weakness to cold, and Wizards with a helpful Ice spell at hand have nothing to fear. 

Shalk have been known, on occasion, to reside within Kwama mines peacefully alongside the Kwama and it's many subspecies. 

The only valuable part of the Shalk is the resin which the Shalk produces which when ingested properly can assist in the healing of wounds, or knock someone out, depending on how it is prepared. Despite it's interesting properties Shalk Resin is rarely distributed outside of Morrowind.

**Silt Striders**

Silt Striders are enormous insect like anthropods with six long thing legs (seemingly ending points) and two long thin arms, also ending in points. The arms and legs seem remarkably similar, to the point that's it questionable as to whether they are different sets of limbs and the behavior of the strider is to treat them as arms or whether they are actually arms like Men and Mer have. On top of their long legs and potential arms the Silt Strider has a thick carapace which houses all of it's organs. 

Silt Striders are not an aggressive animal, and handle difficult terrain with ease due to their height and slender legs, because of this they have been tamed by Dunmer as the primary form of transport around Vvardenfell (which would not be suitable for horse and carts due to the varying degrees of terrain such as marsh and rocky canyons). The Strider is guided by the rider which sits within a hollowed out part of the shell where they guide the Strider by manipulating the behemoths organs and nerves. Customers hiring a silt strider also sit within this hollowed out part, along with any goods, and from personal experience I would like to note that one should not wear ones best robes when travelling by Silt Strider.

This researcher also notes that the Silt Strider Caravaneer by the name ""Selvil Sareloth"" is not to be trusted with valuables, as I am most certain he stole my compass. 

**Wolves**

I'm sure many readers, who haven't visited Vvardenfell, are currently thinking “Wolves are everywhere! Of course they're on Vvardenfell!” and many other readers who have visited Vvardenfell are muttering to themselves “That was a waste of a very reasonable 5 septims.” I would like to state that Wolves can be found on Vvardenfell and this is surprising. The lack of 'normal cyrodiilic animals' on Vvardenfell is astounding, and an ordinary hunter would be surprised to learn of the lack of Deer, Bears, Wolves, Large Cats, and even ordinary Birds (I blame the Cliff Racers). Vvardenfell has a landscape that is incredibly alien compared to Cyrodiil, Skyrim, High Rock, Hammerfell, or even Valenwood, and is perhaps only comparable in it's oddities to the Black Marsh (which this researcher refuses to visit on moral grounds). Wolves are an incredibly rare sight on Vvardenfell, and are usually found in service as domesticated guard dogs. 

I speculate that Wolves are either taken from the borders of mainland Morrowind, or Solstheim at a young age and bought to Vvardenfell as guards because of their ferocity.

1357672527.0,56,self.teslore,1675ca,Daedric Armour light emission research,Chieftah,63,7,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1675ca/daedric_armour_light_emission_research/,"I am currently doing a research about Daedric Armour and abilities. The currently known info includes this: Ebony, a rare volcanic glass, is one of the most precious substances in the Empire, mainly found in Vvardenfell, buried in the lava flows from Red Mountain. Veins can also be found in Solstheim, and occasionally on mainland Skyrim. Raw ebony itself is an extremely hard, durable, black glass-like substance, said to be the crystallized blood of the gods. It is protected by Imperial law, and may not be mined or exported without an Imperial charter. Settlements such as Caldera and Raven Rock once depended on the mining of ebony.
The ore has several alchemical properties and is often smelted into ebony ingots for use in smithing. Ebony armor is made by repeatedly folding the ore upon itself to form strips, which are then molded into shape.[4] This creates a durable, heavy armor. Ebony weapons are also highly prized. Daedric armor and weapons are created from ebony, binding a daedra to the object by use of a process known only to the denizens of Oblivion. Exceptionally skilled smiths can create daedric armor by throwing a daedric heart into melted ebony under a lunar phenomenon, with the harvest moon being the best time to do so. (from UESP)

So, as it explains, daedric armour is actually made from melted ebony mixed with either a daedra heart or with a daedroth (daedra) itself. 


Why the armour glows? In my researches, if a material reaches gas state and it's temperature is still increasing, it might reach plasma state, in which the gas state material molecules start spinning much more faster than in normal gas state (though the distance between them barely differs) and start to emit light (energy). Now my idea would be that some places in daedric armour are filled with a material (probably a daedra heart or some of it's parts) which is able to reach plasma state without any additional heating source. How is that possible? Is it completely a magickal thing or not? My theory would be that the material is being heated by itself since it's a daedra heart. Probably, if you take out the right material from the daedra heart, which normally keeps its energy in a certain volume, when placed in an empty place inside the armour, it (100% separated raw one material) emits more energy when mixed and contained within the heart. If the strange material is D, then m/f would be density of our material, which would allow us to recognize (at least) the closest possible material from our world ones. (Simply body mass divided from body volume results in body density, or m/V=p (can't find ro on my PC). When we know the right material, we can continue by calculating the light emission level (J) and more interesting facts about daedric and ebony). I would appreciate if somebody would take part in this research.

1350322057.0,58,self.teslore,11iqga,The Time God Conspiracy,regalnerd,64,6,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11iqga/the_time_god_conspiracy/,"My friends I believe I have either stumbled upon the grand conspiracy that Nu-Hatta spoke of in the Intercept, or I have taken my final steps into Sheogorath's realm. I will let you decide which.

[Conjecture](/g ""In the main games the various aspects of the Time God have been attempting to undue what the Selectives did when they danced on the tower."")

**Red Mountain and Azura.**

The destruction of the Numidium marks the start of the conspiracy, it showed that Towers can be deactivated and Mundus unbound. After the Warp in the West it was fair game for the various aspects to  destroy the Towers and unbind the dragon, hopefully becoming whole again.

Now as we all know the Nerevarine was sent by Azura to remove the Tribunal's divinity and thus obtain her revenge on them, and this of course required the unbinding of the Heart and the deactivation of Red Tower, it all seems very straight forward on the surface. But lets look a little bit more in depth at the Mistress of Dusk and Dawn. Azura as we have seen in Skyrim gives her followers visions of the future, and her sphere relates to the passing of Time. Because of this I believe Azura to be one of the many Time God aspects (I stopped counting how many there were a long time ago)

Azura, being an aspect of the Time God, must have known that in order to remove the Tribunal's divinity the Nerevarine must deactivate Red Tower, As Divayth Fyr said “Azura, he said, knew and understood all things, and declined to speak of these things, or only spoke in riddles.” I suggest that this was absolutely no problem to her, as she wished to be reunited with her mirror-twins, she killed two birds with one stone, both the deactivation of Red Tower and the end of the Tribunal.

**The Oblivion Crisis.**

This is where the conspiracy gets really good. I should have just titled this part “Hermaeus Mora is a glorious bastard.”

So again as we all know the Oblivion Crisis happened when the Mythic Dawn assassinated Emperor Uriel Septim VII and his Heirs, which ended with the end of the Septim bloodline and the deactivation of White-Gold. This plan was put into place by Mankar Camoran, after reading the Mysterium Xarxes, a book written by Dagon himself.

Lets see what some experts on Daedra have to say about Dagon.

From [Varieties of Daedra](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/varieties-daedra) we have a quote from Divayth Fyr himself.

&gt; Mehrunes Dagon, on the other hand, out of pride, fixity of purpose, and a predictable lack of subtlety in thought, knew nothing and understood nothing, and was inclined to speak freely and without falsehood. 

And from [Interview with two denizens of the Shivering Isles](http://www.imperial-library.info/node/2234) we have this quote from Haskill.

&gt; Or with Mehrunes Dagon. Do not speak his name to me again. The Master of Scum. The pawn of every Prince of true power, the dupe of every schemer in the Nineteen Voids. 

According to these two reputable sources, Dagon is not a man with a plan, he's just a dog on a chain barking at cars, he needs someone to unleash him, and that somebody was Hermaeus Mora. 

Note the name of the holy book of the Mythic Dawn, the Mysterium Xarxes. Xarxes, god of secret knowledge was a scribe to Auri-El and thus servant to Mora. It was Xarxes who gave Dagon the knowledge in the Mysterium Xarxes, and it was Mora who gave the knowledge to Xarxes. And as we have seen in Skyrim he has no problem giving people false info if it means furthering his goals.

Mora, being the Daedra of fate, knew exactly what would happen if he gave that knowledge to Dagon, because in his own words “Past, Present, and Future are all as one to me.”

So now we have a full third of the known towers deactivated in a short period of time by aspects of the Time God. That brings us to the modern age.

**Post Crisis**

Almost immediately after the Crisis the Mane of Elseweyr was assassinated,  if my suspicions of the Thalmor's involvement in the deactivation of Falinesti and the assassination of the Mane that would be two towers deactivated by the Thalmor, who as the ruling kings of Alinor serve Auri-El, and work to unbind him and the entirety of Mundus. This brings the total of confirmed deactivated towers to 6, with 3 confirmed being deactivated by Aspects of the Time god and 2 suspected. The only aspect that has shown an interest in prolonging Mundus and the Kalpa is Akatosh, we see this in the Monomyth, specifically Shezzar's Song, where the pro-mundus Aedra are led by Akatosh, while the anti-mundus Aedra are led by Auri-El.

That brings us to Skyrim, which is a giant mess of Time God aspects and politics. The Dovahkiin in Skyrim has been charged with defending Snow-Throat against the Thalmor and to eliminate a major threat to the people of Mundus, namely Alduin. (Alduin is like Akatosh, neither want to see Mundus unbound, Aka because he loves this Kalpa and Alduin because he wishes to rule it.) And then of course in Dawnguard you can choose to hinder the influence of Auri-El with the blood cursed arrows. So far I have seen no good evidence to suggest that Snow-Throat has been deactivated, so I presume that it is still active. This leaves three towers still active.

Snow-Throat.

Adamantine.

Orichalc.

Before anyone murders me about including Orichalc I would ask you read these lines from Lord Vivec's Sword Meeting With Cyrus the Restless.

&gt; True stories had come that Yokus still lived among the stark remains; that some did not or could not flee when cataclysm came; others that the orichalc isles were a place of censure handed down from the no-totambu. And everyone knew the self-exiled ansu still lived there who did not witness the ho no shira, or the capture of Volen, or the Make Way of Diagna, and so were left to the sword-singing of their histories behind the Curtain of Run. 

The Islands that remain of Yokuda are called the Orichalc Isles, which is why I believe that Orichalc tower is still active.

Since Akatosh is the prime temporal spirit whose appearance led to the formation of the world, perhaps Hermaeus Mora speaks the truth. Nevertheless, it is the will of His Majesty Uriel VII that only on the official holiday of 5th First Seed should any propitiation to this Daedric Prince be delivered. “All else is mutation.”

- The Hist called back the Argonians to fight in Black Marsh before the Oblivion Crisis. 

- Six years before the Sack of Kvatch, Eno Romari in Mournhold knew *exactly* what would happen and was so concerned about the upcoming events that he founded the End of Times cult, was willing to kill himself and called for a mass-suicide. 

- Almalexia knew about Eno Romari and told the Nerevarine that the End of Times cult is a threat for her people. 
However, I don't think that Almalexia's primary goal was to save the ""misguided"" people. Retrospectively, it looks more like she knew about the Oblivion Crisis as well and didn't want her people to know; They would've lost faith in her and her powers.

- If Almalexia knew, Sotha Sil and Vivec surely knew as well.

- Geilir the Mumbling in Solstheim knew about the upcoming events through the seeings of Oddfrid White-Lip as well.

- One could argue that the Nerevarine met two people who, independently of each other, were able to tell him that the Oblivion Crisis will happen, so he basically had confirmation as well.

If you decide to follow them, they talk to you about what happened with their ambush: Ulfric and some Stormcloaks where ambushed at Darkwater Crossing, and were on their way to the Imperial City to be paraded and executed in front of the Emporor. But something happened, so they decided to execute them in Helgen instead.

Now the closest mountain pass into Cyrodil from Darkwater Crossing is the Pale Pass (aka White Pass) which is on the road between Darkwater Pass and Helgen, as shown on in [this](http://majamaki.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/skyrim-map-by-mottis86-lg.jpg) map. And if you visit it in the game you'll notice that it's quite snowy, and that there's no guards at the gate. Not to mention the fact that when Ralof tells you you tried to cross into Skyrim, it sounds like he was already captured when he saw you commit the crime.

This is where my speculation comes in.

The Imperials were on their way to bring Ulfric and his Stormcloaks to Cyrodil through the Pale Pass, but it got snowed in, so they decided to execute them in the nearest town, which was Helgen. 
Now, the Dovahkiin (who was attempting to enter Skyrim through Cyrodil) saw that there were no guards at the gate, and so he/she went through the gate illegally right as the Imperials passed by, so he/she was captured and probably knocked out, which is why you were asleep when the game started.

According to [the map of Skyrim](http://www.uesp.net/maps/srmap/srmap.shtml?centeron=Fort+Snowhawk), Snowhawk is directly west to current Morthal. It is not unlikely that Morthal is the settlement referred to by Oblivion's Night Mother and that, given the chaos of the transition to the Fourth Era, Snowhawk was razed. Perhaps this was via Oblivion Gate (ala Kvatch) or through some military action by a rival Jarl (we have much evidence that relations are not always friendly between the holds of Skyrim), but what is apparent is that Snowhawk is little more than a fortress and Morthal, likely once but a settlement outside the lost city, is now the capital and only settlement to speak of in the entire hold.

First off,

* Given Vvardenfell is a volcanic wasteland, the Sheogorad region wouldn't be habitable in the slightest, or could it?

*  Could it be possible to try and implement more obscure-lore stuff involving House Dagoth? If so, any suggestions?

*  Just in general, given the general consensus around Solstheim in 4E201 that the Almsivi were ""false gods"", Almsivi worship wouldn't be commonplace, but could it make sense for a small cult devoted to the Almsivi to exist in secret?

* How far can the rabbit hole go in terms of obscure lore and Metaphysics? I mean, I want to go DEEP deep. Like, Deeper than Deep.

I would greatly appreciate your help, and forever hold you guys in a small special little place in my heart.

1358809263.0,52,self.teslore,170nio,The Worth of the Soul: The Subtext of a Dragon’s Duel ,Ishullanu,57,5,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170nio/the_worth_of_the_soul_the_subtext_of_a_dragons/,"
It is often said that when two dragons engage in battle, rending each other’s flesh and the world around them through their powerful Thu’ums, that this is more than just a simple physical conflict but a complex metaphysical debate. This can be bewildering to one unfamiliar with the intricacies of the dragon language and world view, a novice of these subjects seeing only the surface level of these conflicts, the waves of flame, frost, and pure entropy spilling forth from the dragon’s maw. As knowledge of the mechanism behind these powers increases, realizing each one of these great powers is linked to specific words of power and fueled by the deepest essence of the dragon itself, the literal label of debate seems wholly fitting. 

 Though, as with most things, when an individual’s comprehension of dragon language surpasses a certain level they are thrown back into the realm of confusion and more questions arise than before they understood the subject at all. Chief among these questions being, how are the clashes between dragons to be considered true debates when the vocabulary of power words in each individual contention rarely reaches more than the same few words repeated again and again? Which brings about another consideration, if these debates so often play out in the same way with similar wording, what is the subject being argued? 

 To address these concerns, it is important to transcend a purely anthropocentric world view, and consider how there are many ways in which the value system of dragons diverges entirely from that of mortals. When scholarly mortals present their arguments it is thought important that they be fact based, supported by evidence, and appealing towards the subjects intellect. Here it is the objective content of the words that is the barometer for truth, and many words are delicately chosen and arranged to try to make them fit the context of the discussion. To a dragon, such context and subtlety is irrelevant. Individual words are known to have power in of themselves, they need not be prettied up through long drawn out sentences, they merely are paired with the few other words most fitting and said with true conviction. 

Indeed, there is what is valued in a dragon’s debate, conviction. The passion behind the words, the power found in understanding the real meaning of even the simplest concept, these are what each side is presenting. While Men and Mer seek to convince through building elaborate structures of words, concepts upon concepts interwoven together impressively, the dragons’ discourse reaches towards something profoundly baser. The appeal to emotions is not only encouraged, it is the only important aspect of the dispute, the shouter is attempting to show their adversary how deeply they feel the words they speak and through their Thu’um they make the other dragon feel it too. Still, these words and their meanings are just the mechanism of showing depth of a dragon’s emotion, they are but the filters through which the dragon conveys what is actually being discussed, the superiority of their soul. 

 A dragon’s soul is immortal, but though it cannot truly be extinguished it can be forced to change form. If a dragon is bested by a fellow dovah, the soul of the vanquished actually transfers into the victor. This is what is at stake in a debate of dragons; this is the subject of their shouts. By channeling the power of their emotion and understanding through their words these dragons are attempting to demonstrate the strength of soul, with the end goal of convincing their opponent that they are more worthy of possessing their soul. When the soul travels from one dragon to another, it does so willingly, it has not been trapped but has been shown this is the best thing for it to do, it is better to be a part of this greater soul than to exist on its own as an inferior. This has to do with the dragon’s inbred need to dominate; their willingness to become an aspect of another soul is within character as long that soul has demonstrated it has the ability to control. So the debate of the dovah is not some petty squabble of what trivial facts are true or false, but it is a measuring of each other’s spirit and attempting to determine who possesses a soul worthy to envelope the others.

This year it has been decided that any subreddit which wants to take part will have it's own community best of awards.

There will be 4 individual categories including 1 best of the best award which are:

* **Best apocrypha**

Apocrypha is a term we use to describe the writings of fans designed to expand upon the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe. It denotes those fan creations executed with technical skill and a dedication to the creation of an organismic, living Tamriel.

* **Best explanation**

The difference between a good explanation and a good apocrypha is that apocrypha seeks to expand the lore whilst the other seeks to explain the Lore.

* **Most helpful answer/reply to a question**
* **Scholar of the year**

and

* **Best submission** (this can be anything that you deem 'best')

-----------------

In order to get everything organised please post your nominations (you cannot nominate yourself only others) for each category. Make a separate post for each category you wish to nominate for in order for the best of each category to get upvoted. Voting/nominations will close on the 26th and the top 3 for each category will be subjected to a 4/5 day poll. Upvote anything and everything which you agree with

For the nominations only upvotes will be counted and any/all downvotes will be discounted. Also please do not look to the 'Most upvoted' posts to make your decision for you. Some of the best posts and explanation were made when the community was far smaller than it is now. The winner of each category will get reddit gold from the Admins via us, the mods.

If you don't like the sound of that, don't worry - for the moment, we're just trialling the feature for one week to see if it works for our community, as many other subreddits are. In one week's time, we'll evaluate whether we should remove or alter it based on its application and what you all think.

Obviously, we think it's going to have a positive effect (if we didn't, we wouldn't do this). The idea is that it will encourage members to review the guidelines and rules when voting on content, resulting in poor quality content being appropriately downvoted. Because erroneous answers will need to separated from correct answers (which is harder to do without votes to distinguish them), they will more likely be corrected in a reply rather than (or in addition to) being downvoted. First and foremost, we're a discussion-based community, so this can only be a good thing. Further evaluations can be reviewed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/1dfem2/moderators_can_now_choose_to_hide_comment_scores/) and elsewhere on reddit.

1362600477.0,54,self.teslore,19smmy,"On the marriage practices of Morrowind, and some notes on the institution of slavery in Morrowind",FrankManic,60,6,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19smmy/on_the_marriage_practices_of_morrowind_and_some/,"Velothi – Something along Mongol lines. The Velothi seem strongly tied to their tribes, rather than nuclear or lineal families. The Marriage would likely be officiated by the Wise Woman and involve appealing to the ancestors, the good Daedra, and the spirits of Vvardenfell to witness and approve the marriage. Elves are very long lived, to the order of thousands of years among the Telvanni and Altmer. It seems unlikely that Ashlander marriages would be permanent, simply due to the span of time (And the Dunmer's famously dour character). Given the relatively slow Elven life span and the great danger of living in the Ashlands among beasts, daedra, bandits, smugglers, and the odd Ordinator it seems likely that remarriage would be a fairly simple affair. Dark elves are known for promiscuity in their youth and for a people that live that long I doubt virginity is considered important or notable. 

Important life stages are likely marked by becoming proficient with weapons and magic. The Magribrash suggest that women are acknowledged as being potential fighting wizards. Likewise the hazards of the ashlands and the rough equality of men and women, coupled with the great deal of time women spend not-pregnant compared to the briefer races, suggests that women are likely fighters alongside men. 

Pre-marriage rituals likely include exchange of gifts – clothing, armor, weapons, blankets, magical scrolls or spells, guars, nix, shalk, various household goods, silver and gold. Ashlanders are noted for taking the exchange of gifts very seriously. It is always considered good form to offer bribes, that is to give a gift of gold. For serious occaisions it is considered important to show respect by learning about the recipient and offering a gift that will be suitable to their temperment, useful, and valuable to that specific person. Value is not as important as the care that goes into choosing the gift.

Additonally a visit to the ancestor tombs of the various Dunmeri families seems likely, and if not that then pilgrimage to ancestor shrines, sacred places, or daedric shrines. 

The ceremony itself is likely brief, involving some sort of proclamation from the wise woman, a blessing from the Ashkhan, some sort of formula between representatives of each person's family, 

Redoran

Likely the most 'tradtional' of the great houses. Probably shares many characteristics with Indoril and Dren nobility. Likely viewed as a meeting of families, though again given the long lives of elves one cannot be sure of that. Most likely involves the presence of senior members of each persons lineal family, one or more Tribunal representatives to witness the marriage in the name of AlmSiVi, and perhaps a ranking member of the Redoran formal structure. It seems likely that Nerevar and Almalexia would stand as the model for the ideal Dunmer marriage. Though given how that marriage ended it would be somewhat ironic. The presence of an ancestor ghost would likely depend on the degree to which the individuals present followed ancestor worship practices. More likely for the Redoran, less likely for Indoril. And Dren, being somewhat difficult to know away on the border of Argonia, cannot be commented on. 

The event itself likely involves a visit to the local Tribunal temple or shrine where the marriage is witnessed by AlmSiVi and approved by the House representative. This would likely be followed by a reception and a party. Redorans being Redorans this would likely serve as a time to meet and reaffirm featly and comittment to Redoran. 

Indoril – Indoril being strongly committed to the Tribunal, few in number, and having a large proportion of nobles would likely follow similar customs to the Redoran. If anything they are likely to be stuffier, more formal, and less accepting of any western or pre-AlmSiVi influence. 

Telvanni – It would seem that Telvanni practices are as wildly distinctive as the Telvanni themselves. It's commonly known that the only time the Telvanni pay attentiont to anything outside fireball range is if they believe it's a threat to themselves, Telvanni as a whole, or Morrowind. The sorry state of Tribunal shrines (frequently in the basement, behind the door marked ""Beware of Vermai"") and of Tribunal temples (there aren't any) demonstrate the disinterest of the Telvanni in religious matters. A marriage is unlikely to involve anything beyond the agreement of the principles. If there is significant property or prestige involved the local Wizard Lord or a representative might be requested to witness and keep track of any marriage document. Beyond that there is likely to be a party of some sort. It seems likely that a Telvanni celebration would be quite a sight, providing the wizards a chance to show off some of their flashier magic or to summon otherworldly entertainment. It would also serve as an excuse for families to visit each other, travelling between isolated Telvanni townships and holds. 

Hlallu – the Hlallu are most likely to adopt western practices. It would not be surprising if a Hlallu wedding involved an edgy Tribunal witness standing alongside a priestess of the Nine Divines. The Hlallu houses are notable for being more competitive than members of the other great houses; it seems more likely that attention would be paid to a marriage contract. It is also likely that Hlallu would seek to adopt trends and fashions from other parts of Tamriel, as the house as a whole in noted for it's interest in and acceptance of other cultures. 

Commoners – Commoner weddings are fairly unpretenious affairs. A journey to the Tribunal temple to seek the witness of AlmSiVi, perhaps a visit to the ancestral shrine, followed by a party hosted by the families of the betrothed. The formal portions are short and simple, the party being the most notable aspect. 

Slaves – The Dren and Telvanni are the primary slaveholders on Morrowind. The manner in which the two houses hold slaves is distinctive. The Dren hold large numbers of slaves as field and plantation workers. Dren slaves perform a great deal of the agricultural work of southern Morrowind. Comparitively the Dren slave is less likely to be well treated. Dren slaves are traded more frequently, less likely to receive medical care, and more likely to die young, frequently of overwork or illness. The majority of Telvanni slaves work in or around the house or compound. It's hard to generalize with Telvanni, and they do have many field slaves. In a very general sense, however, Telvanni slaves are better off than Dren slaves. The large number of magicians and wizards make health care less expensive. Telvanni are also much less likely to trade slaves. A given slave family will likely live under a single Telvanni master their entire life. 
Telvanni slaves are much more likely than Dren slaves to engage in some craft or trade and the Telvanni generally allow their slaves to keep the procedes of their trade. 

Slavery under the Telvanni, in many ways, resembles Peonage in Bretony more than the grueling forced labor of the Dren. Many Telvanni Slaves grow to have, in not a friendly, at least a tolerant relationship with their masters. It helps somewhat that the Telvanni wizard-lords are as disinterested in their slaves as they are in most everything except magic and intriguing. The dispassionately practical Telvanni often ensure their Slaves relative comfort for the simple reason that it's less trouble to keep them happy than to hunt down escapees and put down revolts. It is notable that men and mer will occaisionally sell themselves into slavery in a Telvanni household. For those who are poor but have some craft or an intellect that makes them valuable to the Telvanni this is a way of securing food and shelter. This sort of slave is somewhere between a dependent and a valuable posession.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_19smmy,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19smmy/on_the_marriage_practices_of_morrowind_and_some/,

I'm gonna do a quick write up to fill you in on most of it.

First, you have to understand where the Khajiit have come from. Many can see an Empire or new leadership as a real big thing, e.g. Ulfric as new High King of Skyrim. Khajiit don't bother so much with caring about that. Kingdoms and Empires have come and gone in Elsweyr, with the earliest being 16 individual kingdoms in the land of Elsweyr somewhere in the First or Merethic era; all of which are turned to rubble and long gone, many beneath that sands of Anequina (refraining from proper terms for simplicity). Khajiit know leaders come and go, unless they will directly affect them right in their face, who cares? they will not keep Elsweyr forever, no one has or ever will.

You also have to understand that the Empire has been rough on Elsweyr. They:

* Take Leyawiin

* Tiber Septim just takes Rimmen's land and uses it for the Numidium's rebuilding, forever fucking up the land

* Possibly outlaw Moon Sugar, not sure, but also completely criminalise Skooma (yes, Skooma is dangerous to Khajiit too, but only one town, Rimmen IIRC, has ever tried to ban it once. It's their right to mess themselves up)

* Have citizens who look down upon Khajiit more harshly than other races, bar Argonians and possibly Orcs

Khajiit and authority are also a tricky thing. I liken the image to Khajiit and authority as two figures holding hands and slapping each other at the same time. For simplicity's sake in this quick post, I'll just leave it to this: Khajiit have a concept of authority alien to humans.

Anyway, lets bring this to a time to focus on. Early 4th Era. Oblivion Crisis is over and pretty much everywhere except Black Marsh has been affected negatively by it. Oh yeah and that no-good, annoying Empire lost it's dynasty. Khajiit are picking up the peices in Elsweyr and skipping forward about 100 years, what happens? Void Nights.

Now, you have to really understand how important the moons are to Khajiit. Not only are they forever bound to the Lunar Lattice, the purpose of Khajiit is to literally fix Jone and Jode (two gods that save mundus on a day-to-day basis mind you) if something goes off. Now, Jone and Jode don't even *exist* (at the time). Beyond Jone and Jode isn't just space/Aetherius/Oblivion, beyond Jone and Jode is AHNURR. The god who one-hit killed Fadomai and is still pissed so much he shook the very universe itself and he's still angry. That sounds like a damn fine reason to be scared to me.

Not only that, Khajiit have to think about what happens to their children. Now, we don't know what's fact when it comes to Khajiiti children during the Void Nights, but the most commonly accepted idea is that it resulted in stillbirths for two years. That's rather worrying, your whole race dieing off because you cant procreate.

Then who comes to save the day? Not the Empire, they don't give two shits about us, but the Altmer! The Altmer practically saved Khajiit and returned not only entire gods, but also protection of Nirn and purpose for Khajiit again.

Now that's no reason to go up and join them, now is it? No. But that's not all. The Altmer dont just give the moons back and bugger off, they actually help out Elsweyr as a whole. The AD comes in, restores the two ancient kingdoms Anequina and Pelletine, then helps Khajiit leave the Empire for a group that's actually been helping them. Now Elsweyr is more unified (probably as unified as it's ever going to realistically get [EDIT: without stuffing up soon]) and is, without a doubt, wealthier in both cash and culture.

The Aldmeri Dominion are actually looking like pretty good guys here, aren't they? That's because they are. The AD is the best thing that's happened to Elsweyr in a long time and furthermore they don't try to go in thinking they know everything about Khajiit and rule over them. The AD helped bring back Khajiiti kingdoms to rule Khajiit, not some foreign empire that thinks they know everything. Khajiit would definitely fight for the AD, they're the only ones who are making Elsweyr prosper.

I've probably made a fair amount of spelling/grammatical errors, I'm not really going to go over it since this is a quick peice.

1356801676.0,53,self.teslore,15mp5k,"Concerning a certain Dragon in Blackreach
CONJECTURE",DingoDoug,69,16,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15mp5k/concerning_a_certain_dragon_in_blackreach/,"Preface: 
As some of you may know, there is indeed a dragon within Blackreach, called Vulthuryol. He can be summoned by using an Unrelenting Force shout on the orange orb in the center of the Silent City. The dragon will appear after a short delay. Now on to the good stuff.

Vulthuryol's name in the Dragon Language translates to ""Dark Overlord Fire""; this provides the largest insight into the the creature's nature. ""Dark"" obviously corresponds to the dragon's location in Blackreach. It is uncommon for a name in the Dragon Tongue to refer to anything but the dragon itself. In other words, ""Vul"" is unusual in that it refers to the environment in which the dragon inhabits rather than the actual dragon. I believe that this means Vulthuryol was named after he was ""discovered"" within Blackreach, most likely by agents of the dragons. If this is true, it makes ""thur"" or ""overlord"" doubly interesting. What exactly is Vulthuryol the overlord of? The most obvious answer is Blackreach and its denizens. This is enforced by the fact that neither the dragon, nor the creatures of the abyss are hostile to one another. On the surface, when any other dragon lands, it is immediately targeted by any and all creatures on the ground, including all varieties of Chaurus (this can be observed in the swamps east of Solitude, where leveled Chauruses will spawn). So we have the fact that Vulthuryol is the Overlord of Dark Blackreach. ""Yol"" is likely a reference to the dragon's entrance; after being summoned, he will circle around the perimeter of the city, breathing fire, but never at any enemies. It is worth noting that Vulthuryol always spawns with the same mesh as an Ancient Dragon, though he (thankfully) does not have the same stats until later levels.

One of the most interesting things about Vulthuryol is just how obscure he is. His name does not appear in the ""Atlas of Dragons"" in Sky Haven Temple, which shows that his very existence was unknown, even to the Dragonguard and Blades. This could mean that he has lived since the days of the earliest dragons, as he was one the very few who escaped death at the hands of humans. This is enforced by the fact that there is no Dragon Burial Mound in Blackreach. 

Vulthuryol's location is bizarre as well. There is no possible way to gain entrance into Blackreach without possessing an Attunement Sphere, and even then, a dragon's frame is too large to fit into the small stairwell beneath the Dwarven mechanism that serves as the gate to Blackreach. This means that Volthuryol has either resided in Blackreach since its formation, or managed to find some other way in. 

So what does all of this mean? Is Vulthuryol an outcast? Or are his motives just different from those of the other dragons? Does he seek to raise an army of Falmer and attack the surface, hence his title of overlord? Or is he in hiding? I believe that Vulthuryol is a sort of ""third party"" among the other Dovah; Alduin seeks to devour the world with the aid of his cohorts, Paarthurnax wishes to stop him, and finally Vulthuryol is planning to raise an army from the abyss and aid the Falmer as they retake the surface world.

1349675222.0,50,self.teslore,114j54,The Handless Mage,Ishullanu,61,11,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/114j54/the_handless_mage/,"(Though the following thoughts are extrapolated mostly from in game observation on how mortals use magicka, it also seems to match many of the descriptions found in lore books explicitly describing magic use, and because of that I believe it is appropriate for lore discussion. Such book examples include the battle magic found in “[Mystery of Talara Part III](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/mystery-talara)” and the clear inclusion of hands for the enchanting process in “[Twin Secrets](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/twin-secrets)”. And as this is almost entirely conjecture I have chosen to forgo the conjecture tag, if only to save us from the giant wall of green)

When observing a spell being cast, it is plain to see that a certain measure of manual manipulation is required to form the magicka to the mage’s purpose. The process starts with an internal declaration of what spell is intended, a recollection of techniques and thought processes known from the relevant school, then magicka is visibly expelled from and directed by the hand. This is often coupled with some sort of broad gesture or intricate finger movements (this does not include the power of the Nordic Thu’um, which is believed to be a gift granted by either Kynareth or Akatosh, is accomplished by different processes, and does not seem connected to an individual’s magicka pool). The hands may well be necessary for channeling internal power, shaping raw magicka into the spell and focusing it like a lens. If this is true, removal of hands could result in the metaphysical castration of the mage, eliminating much if not all of their spellcasting capacity. This punishment could be used in situations where a mage has large potential for dangerous behavior or is likely to lose control of their power, but where death would be deemed as unnecessarily cruel.

Now the suggestion that something as mundane as amputation could affect something as extraordinary as magical ability may seem implausible, but it has been shown conclusively that an injury to one’s physical form can destroy or limit magical abilities. An example of this was seen with Tiber Septim [losing his power of the Voice after his throat was slit](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tiber_Septim#cite_note-name-1). So even though these powers transcend our physical selves, it would appear they still require a material means. 

But there could also be ways to circumvent this disability, to become The Handless Mage. A powerful wizard could attempt to mimic something similar to the Nordic shout, developing techniques of the tongue and throat to mimic the articulations of the hand. It seems improbable that the same measure of precision could be gained with this technique, and it could be entirely impossible to be a true spellcaster this way, likely being limited to abilities currently known to be attainable through words of power.

With enough arcane authority and knowledge, perhaps the memory of one's hands could be enough. To focus the spirit and mind sharply enough, one could supposedly create literal phantom limbs, which in turn would move to shape the mage's magicka further. The precedent here being ghosts and spirits, without physical limbs of there own, still being able to project their will through ethereal representations of extremities they used to possess. 

The link between what lies at the end of our arms and the forces we can project beyond them is apparent, but what occurs when that link is severed is far more ambiguous. This type of injury could be a magic user’s greatest weakness, literally cutting them off from accessing their inherent power. Or hand removal could be a potential boon, removing a wizard’s reliance on the physical and creating a more direct involvement of one’s own spirit in controlling the flow of magicka. Unfortunately these theories exist in the hypothetical, and the magical potential of the Handless Mage will remain a mystery unless some brave and curious scholars choose to engage in empirical testing.

Not everything made it into this volume, as I wanted to use a lot for the next volume on Argonians. Thanks a lot!*

*Welcome back to the eighth volume of 'On the Species of Tamriel'. This volume deals with one of the strangest races on Nirn, the Hist. These sentient trees are incredible important, not only to the Argonians, but to the entirety of Tamriel. Even though this is a relative small addition to 'On the Species', it is instrumental in further understanding the Argonians.*

The Hist are probably the most secretive and hardest to understand race on Tamriel, not only because they appear very mundane to the untrained eye, but also because of their unfathomable knowledge and intelligence. Even though there are no reports of Hists communicating with other races than the Argonians, who are extremely defensive over the trees, they are instrumental in the history of Tamriel.

There are not many noteworthy biological traits of the Hist. Indeed, in almost all features they resemble standard trees, albeit very big ones. Even though an average Hist is about the size of an oak, there are examples of Hist being slightly shorter than the trees of Valenwood, albeit being more spread out. The largest Hist is in Lilmoth, Black Marsh, and is seen as the most important one, even though this is a pure mortal distinction, as all Hists are linked together via their roots, forming a hive mind. In short: all Hists are connected, and share the same mind. This also attributes to the incredible knowledge (even of previous Kalpa's) the Hists have, as, even though one Hist is mortal, his knowledge and mind are not, as these are absorbed in the hive mind, and kept with all the other Hist.  
Furthermore, the Hist give off a special sap, which is incredibly important to the Argonians, as it is not only the only way for the Hist to comunnicate with any non-Hist, but it also what gives argonians their shape, form, sentience and soul.  
Pinpointing any features other than these is virtually impossible, as the sap of the Hist has strange shaping properties, making it possible for a Hist to shape itself into multiple shapes, and increasing it's adaptability.

The origin of the Hist is unknown to us. What is known, is that the Hist had been around at the same time as the Et'Ada, predating Mundus. Indeed, they were the first inhabitants of Nirn, even before the Ehlnofey. Along with Nirn, the Hists also had a realm of Oblivion of their own, the name lost to us, along with relatives of them (called the Um-Hist) inhabiting the realm of Clavicus Vile. During the Ehlnofey war, the realm of the Hist was mostly destroyed, the remains merging with Nirn and forming Black Marsh, despite their neutrality.

This neutrality is something common to the Hist. Because of their huge intelligence, the Hist are known to predict most major events on Tamriel, being able to adjust themselves and the Argonians to deal with the future threats. In this sense, neutrality is a very short sighted term, as the Hist will interfere in one way or the other, if they themselves are at risk.  
Even though the Hist are all linked, and share the same thoughts, it is not unheard of rogue Hists, who split themselves off of the hive mind. When this happens, the other Hist team up, and destroy the rogue Hist, one way or the other.

As stated earlier, the only thing we know of the origin of the Hists, is that they were already present when Mundus was not yet created, and that they were the first inhabitants of Nirn. their realm got destroyed during the Ehlnofey wars, despite their neutrality.  
It is safe to say that at almost all major events in Black Marsh, the Hist played one role or the other. During the Oblivion crisis, for instance, the Hist had already been calling back Argonians for years, to condition them for the impending dangers, making them better fighters, and more durable to the horrors of the Deadlands of Mehrunes Dagon. This was successful, and caused Dagon to order all gates in Black Marsh closed. This also further strengthened the position of the An-Xileel, a political party in Black Marsh which acted as the Hist's lieutenants. With the support of the Hist, the An-Xileel ordered the secession of Black Marsh from the Empire, making it the first province to do so.

*These strange trees of Black Marsh are indeed one of the more curious races of Tamriel, if not a force to reckon with. Their shape altering abilities are incredibly important to the Argonians, and, in turn, for the whole of Nirn. A basic understanding of these magnificent creatures is necessary to further understand the Argonians, with who the next volume will deal.*

1364018215.0,52,self.teslore,1aui1e,The Mabrigash,AzraelDomonov,58,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1aui1e/the_mabrigash/,"*“… But above all, beware the Mabrigash, renegade Witch-Warrior women who practice the dark magics.”* - Andilo Thelas, Dunmer Savant

Within the bleak and barren climate of the Ashlands, food is scarce and danger is constant, so much so that the various tribes of unsettled Dunmer are said to live on a razors edge between life and death. It is here, where the dust blows across the landscape, that the concept of 'tradition' is emphasized perhaps more so than anywhere else on Tamriel. Honor is their currency. Ritual is their lifeblood. But what happens when an Ashlander chooses to break with that tradition, not only to forsake the Ashlander way of life in favor of another, but to abandon an important position within the tribe and break the taboos that such people hold sacred?

Ashlander society is governed by a strict tribal hierarchy, family ties, and an ancient code of honor. Within this hierarchy, gender plays an extremely important role. It should be said that the extent at which these rules are enforced within a tribe is by no means uniform amongst the Ashlanders. Much depends on a specific tribe's traditions, the discretion of the local Ashkhan, and any extraneous circumstances. The Ashlanders, after all, are nothing if not adaptable. 

An Ashlander's gender imports a series of traditions the individual must follow, as well as determining the possible positions within society available to them. Women, for instance, cannot become warriors, or serve in the Ashkhan's retinue (known as Gulkhans amongst the Ashlanders.) Likewise, the position of Wise Woman is an exclusively female role. Amongst the Ashlanders, the Wise Woman is a repository of culture and traditional knowledge, serving as equal parts councilor, storyteller, seer and healer. Each tribe usually has a primary Wise Woman conducting affairs, who may take on several other Wise Women as her apprentices. The Ashkhan, the Warrior-Chief of the tribe, is a traditionally male position, but it is not unheard for a woman to assume the title. A female Ashkhan is almost pointless, however, as they are prevented from carrying out most of the crucial activities of the position, such as leading the tribe's warriors into battle, conducting raids on other tribes, or engaging in duels to defend the tribe's honor. As such, a female Ashkhan is usually only named at times when the previous Ashkhan has died and left no clear successor. Healers, when not Wise Women themselves, are traditionally female. The tasks of herder, hunter and scout are open to both sexes. 

As one can see, gender does play a large role in organizing Dunmer tribal hierarchy. This information, however, should not be misconstrued to view all Ashlanders as incapable of equity amongst the sexes.  Quite differently, many Ashlanders hold the women of the tribe in great respect. The position of Wise Woman is considered an important and vital one, and many times women are treated with the same courtesy and respect as men, especially amongst the northern tribes. However, one cannot generalize such attributes of respect either. There exist a number of cases where things are quite the opposite.

Amongst the more warlike bands, the position of women within the tribe is significantly decreased. This is most exemplified in the position of the local Wise Woman. If the Ashkhan is powerful and greedy, the position of Wise Woman is reduced to a totally ceremonial role. Similarly, the position of all women in such tribes is held below that of the men, especially the Ashkhan and the Gulkhans. In such tribes, abuse and slave-like conditions are commonplace. The Wise Women are often exempt from the worse of this (many suspect this to be due to possible traditions of chastity surrounding the position of Wise Woman.) Still, to see the members of her clan beaten, raped and humiliated can be too much for the proud Ashlander to bare. Some say that it is out of such an environment that a Mabrigash is born.

Mabrigash (The term is often used for both the singular and plural forms) are the Witch-Warriors of Ashlander legend. They are Wise Women who have abandoned their position within a tribe and forsaken the traditional rules of conduct. They break the provisional taboos preventing a Wise Woman from wielding weapons, and train in the use of the War Axe (a weapon normally reserved for Gulkhans,) along with other tools of war.  They are well versed in various aspects of dark magic, while retaining the Wise Woman’s proficiency in both the alteration and rejuvenation colleges of magic. Ashlander magic, and by extent Mabrigash magic, differs from western magic significantly, in that Ashlanders emphasize a combination of charms and incantations that strengthen their user, while opting to wield curses that damages the life force of their target directly, rather than using the elemental magics of destruction. Mabrigash have delved deep into the study of these curses more so than any normal Wise Woman, and as such they are incredibly powerful. The source of their power supposedly comes from the vital essence of men which, they drain from their bodies through the use of the Ghost Snake, a subject which will be elaborated upon later. 

To break with a tribe and become a Mabrigash is no simple event. Ashlander society knows only two forms of punishment for trespass; banishment and death. The punishment for a Wise Woman practicing the dark arts is normally death, but many tribes opt for exile, for they fear the Mabrigash’s power. What separates the Mabrigash from other outcasts is the fact that this exile is often mutually approved; The Mabrigash want nothing to do with the men of the tribes, and the tribes want nothing to do with the fearsome witch-women. As such, and uneasy truce is often forged, with neither group explicitly bothering the other without provocation. 

The Mabrigash draw exclusively from the ranks of Wise Women, and as such there are exclusively female. It is speculated that many Mabrigash were once simply rebellious seers in training, who found the restrictive life of a Wise Woman unsavory, but it is more reasonable to assume that a number of them were full-fledged Wise Women who took issue with the way a tribe was being run by a disrespectful Ashkhan. Whatever their reason for become Mabrigash may be, the change is a definitive and irrevocable one, for once a woman becomes a Mabrigash, there is no turning back. The point at which a Wise Woman becomes a Mabrigash is usually pinpointed at their first use of the Ghost Snake, signifying a full break with the tribal ways, but it is unknown how the Mabrigash themselves what constitutes a ‘real’ Mabrigash. Mabrigash will often arrange themselves into small groups, numbering around two or three, and are known to camp near roads and tribal settlements, so as to ensnare passersby from which they can drain energy to fuel their practices. 

To outsiders, the Mabrigash may appear to be another simple variant of the common witches found all over Tamriel, but according to most research, lumping them in with a series of diverse magic-users with a penchant for stealing traveler’s clothes would be a grave mistake. The variances between more common Western magic and Ashlander magic, as illustrated above, mark a key difference between the two. Mabrigash, like all other Ashlanders, also abstain from the conjuration of spirits, which is considered profane in Velothi culture. It is unclear whether the Mabrigash are capable of enlisting the same level of voluntary support from their ancestor-spirits as their Wise Women cousins, or if the process of becoming a Mabrigash severs some link with the ancestor clan. What’s more, while many witches may seek out and target men with their abilities for personal reasons, a Mabrigash is distinct in that they seek out male targets to serve in themselves as a source of power. The Mabrigash directly drains the power of their target, and grow stronger as a result. 

The method by which a Mabrigash drains the vital essence of her target is known as the Ghost Snake.  The exact nature of the Ghost Snake is unknown; it is a closely guarded secret amongst the Mabrigash, for whose way of life it is essential. Most mages who have studied it describe it as a regular (albeit advanced) form of magic. Still, it is uncertain if this magic represents the Ghost Snake in its entirety, or if it is simple one part of a greater ritual. Some rumors link it with an almost religious significance amongst Mabrigash, going so far as to suggest the Ghost Snake is actually a representation of some deity (Boethia, perhaps,) but again, this is extreme speculation. What is known, due to careful documentation, are the effects of the Ghost Snake. The Ghost Snake draws out the vital energies of its target, their very life force, and by doing so increases the power of the Mabrigash. Only women are supposedly able to utilize the Ghost Snake, although why this is exactly is unknown. No documented cases of its use by any other than the Mabrigash exist. There are speculated to be two main variants of the Ghost Snake, one fast acting and one slow acting, but both are theorized to simply be variations on the same technique. The fast acting method directly paralyzes the target, and drains their bodily strength for a short period of time. This can leave the target extremely weak for a period of time, usually long enough for the Mabrigash to either kill or capture whomever is unlucky enough to be her prey. The use of the Ghost Snake in this manner has not been shown to affect the physical strength of the Mabrigash in any noticeable way. The slow form is not nearly as well understood as the fast form, with most of the descriptions of its workings being relegated to rumor. It is believed, like the fast form, to drain the strength of its target, leaving them weak and servile while preventing them from running away. However, it acts over a much longer period of time than the short form, and its effects on the target are not as immediately severe as the short form (although over the long term the effects can be much worse.) The long form also differs from the short form in that it is said that the draining of strength from the target somehow serves to empower the Mabrigash, somehow transferring the ‘vital essence’ of one unto another, allowing the Mabrigash to practice their dark magic. Stories often list captives being held for long periods of time to be slowly drained by the Mabrigash, much in the same way that Vampires have been rumored to keep stock for blood (it should be noted that a connection between Vampirism and the Mabrigash has not yet been theorized.)In such stories, the use of the long form is often tied in with an increase in the strength and vitality of the Mabrigash, sometimes even suggesting the Ghost Snake can be used to artificially prolong the lifespan of the Mabrigash into immortality (although this is largely rumor, and can in many cases be attributed to a misunderstanding of the female Dunmer’s long lifespan.) While examples of the short form being practiced on targets of both sexes exist, the rumored targets of the long form are exclusively male. Amongst a few variants of the rumors surrounding the long form of the Ghost Snake are notable sexual undertones, which seem to suggest that the male captives of the Mabrigash serve as items of pleasure for these witch-warriors, who drain their life force though cardinal rituals, giving the term ‘vital essence’ a whole new meaning. These stories are largely lacking in evidence, however, and are mostly attributed to the storyteller’s use of poetic license to add entertainment to the tale. 

Through the collection of firsthand accounts from lucky (or unlucky, depending on how one looks at it,) survivors of the technique, one is able to piece together the sensation of what it feels like to be on the receiving end of the Ghost Snake. At first, when the paralysis takes hold, the body feels as if it is on fire, with the sensation of spasms and seizure coursing through the body, despite the fact that the person cannot actually move. As this continues, the physical energy of the man begins to wane, until the muscles are limp and the body is useless. The blood feels as if it drains from the limbs, and then is turned into bile and poison. The sensation is akin to being on the receiving end of one the mystical poisons employed commonly by many mages throughout Tamriel, although with none of the associated physical damage, as the feeling exists solely in the senses. After a few short seconds, the paralysis wears off, but at this point the man is so incredibly weak that they are often unable to move. The energy for action is removed from the body, and a sensation of extreme lethargy takes hold. Finally, a chilling cold sensation enters through the throat before spreading out through the rest of the body. First one feels frozen. Then one feels numb. Then one feels nothing at all.

All of these descriptions are notable for the fact that they come exclusively from outside observers, rather than directly from the mouth of a Mabrigash. Much of this is due to the Mabrigash, like many Ashlanders, not using writing as a way of recording information. Interviewing a Mabrigash directly presents many problems due to their hostile nature, but it is not unheard of for a person to be able talk with a Mabrigash and live. When asked about their way of life, Mabrigash have a tendency to be tight-lipped. They too say that only women are able to use the Ghost Snake, saying as well that they are unbound by the man’s rules of behavior within mainstream Ashlander culture. They seem to revel in their own notoriety, which seems to suggest that they are not actually as hostile as rumors make them out to be, but rather allow such rumors to spread so as to keep meddling hands out of their business. Many also find many of the stories surrounding them, especially those told by men, to be quite humorous and foolish. When asked about the Ghost Snake, Mabrigash seem to indicate that the subject is far more complicated than many of the stories surrounding them make it out to be. The Mabrigash do not talk about the Ghost Snake in terms of ‘long form’ or ‘short form’ either, suggesting that the distinction is a misnomer, or that perhaps the long form does not actually exist. Mabrigash find the idea that they ‘drain the vital essence of men’ to be missing the point, and seem to suggest that the truth of the matter is far more complicated than a simple transfer of power from one person to the Mabrigash. From these accounts, many have come to believe that the true nature of both the Mabrigash and the Ghost Snake are largely misunderstood by outsiders, but also that the Mabrigash are perfectly happy with the reputation this misunderstanding has given them. Even the less violent among them are incredibly secretive, and direct discussions with a Mabrigash serve to clarify very little about their nature.

When examining the Mabrigash, it is important not to force the idea of what the Mabrigash represent into a pre-made dialectic or organizational structure. It is very easy to see them as some form of symbol for the ‘battle of the sexes’ within Ashlander culture, but to view them as such disregards much of what we actually know about the Mabrigash. As illustrated above, gender is very important amongst both the tribal Ashlanders and the Mabrigash, but it is far too simplistic to view their existence as simply a reaction to gender relations within Ashlander society. One must remember that a Mabrigash begins her life as a Wise Woman, with the abilities and responsibilities of that position. More than almost any other trait, the Ashlander Wise Women are known for the deep empathy they harbor for their clan and their people. Could it perhaps be, then, that the Mabrigash are simply Wise Women who have forgotten how to care, who have abandoned their responsibilities in favor of the pursuit of power? Perhaps, but this is an overly simplistic view, which leads one to believe it to at least not be the entire truth of the matter. The desire to help is born into the Wise Women of the Ashlands, and they are trained to assist their people from the moment they are born; such habits would not disappear so easily. The Wise Women of the Ashlands are said to be seers, capable of viewing the future through their dreams. Was it some obscure vision which drove them to live the way they do, or are they fulfilling some forgotten prophecy the likes of which we cannot grasp? Could the talk surrounding them be simple myth, and they are really just witches by a different name? Or is the true nature of the Mabrigash something more? 

None but the Mabrigash themselves know for certain, and it doesn’t appear as if these Witch-Warriors of the Ashlands will be revealing the truth any time soon. For now, they remain shrouded in mystery, ready to strike fear into the heart of any man who so much as hears the word ‘Mabrigash.’

Orismer (Orcs) are actually descendants of Aldmer which means they are elves giving the name Oris""mer"". When Trinimac was corrupted so were his followers making them look ""ugly"" as the other races call them.


Orcs follow the Code of Malacath unless they live as an Imperial citizen that follows Imperial laws. The Code of Malacath is an unwritten set of rules that are pretty basic. Don't steal, don't kill, don't attack people for no reason (There are many exceptions for the last one).  These codes are never written any where, but are past on from generation to generation. Orsinium and all Orc strongholds follow the Code of Malacath.

In Orc Strongholds who ever is the strongest male becomes the chief. Only Chiefs can have wives. This method is to ensure that the strongest Orc becomes chief, contributing his genes to the next generation of orcs who in theory should be stronger than the last. Also if you have a problem then you deal with it you don't have some imperial guards deal with your problem. Strongholds do not have jails or prisons, but have a thing called ""Blood Price"", this is when the criminal bleeds until the victim is satisfied. Orcs all sleep under the same roof of a longhouse and have feasts there as well. Orc strongholds rely on each other and are sort of a big family.

Orc culture is widely surrounded around battle and war. Orcs believe to die in battle would be the most honorable death. Their culture is also surrounded around blacksmithing and have been known for their quality armor they make and their fierceness in battle. These are some of the reasons the Empire recruits Orcs from Strongholds.


Orsinium is considered Orc's homeland even though it has been ransacked many times. Orsinium was first established in the Tenth century of the Second Era. Orsinium started off as a few tribes, but then Orc chieftain Torug gro-Igron brought his people together. Orismer had been pariah of the land of the land for 200 years and to hear of a place that Orcs could call home was too amazing not to be sought. 

Orc historians said it was a utopia, a peaceful land full of agriculture and commerce. Orcs were not the only ones to live there but, Goblins, Gremlins, and Ogres that worshipped Mauloch (Malacath) as well. 

However this dream didn't last long. In 1E 950 the first Siege of Orsinium began. Other neighboring countries feared Orcs were gaining too much power so a joint military force made up of the Breton armies of Daggerfall and the Redguard soldiers of Sentinel invaded the Orc homeland, but Orsinium's walls wouldn't be breached until 30 years later and the Orcs proved themselves to be fearsome and brutal warriors. The forces overran the city and was razed to the ground in 1E 980. The Orismer homeland would rise again.

Over the next 3000 years other Orcs attempted to create new homelands, but all were destroyed before any could even begin.

Then in 3E 399, an Orc, Gortwog gro-Nagorm acquired the land near the former site of Orsinium through a duel against Lord Bowyn, you can read more in [Orsinium and the Orcs.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/orsinium-and-orcs) 

This new version of Orsinium, was sometimes called Nova Orsinium. The city had statues of Orc heroes such as Mauloch and Torug. Nova Orsinium was destined to provoke the same reaction the first Orsinium did. Gortwog was a political genius and the Orc homeland prospered and it now encompasses a substantial territory of central High Rock. Its application to become a province is under review by the Imperial authorities. 

Then there is a religous conflict that has brewed for the last 10 years. Most Orcs worshipped the Daedric Prince Malacath. However Gortwog and high ranking shaman priests believe that Trinimac still lives and that Malacath is a separate entity. The Orcs that support Gortwog fear that turning their back on Malacath will anger the Daedric Prince. 


We don't know a whole lot about the second sacking of Orsinium, but the combined forces of Hammerfell and High Rock invaded Orsinium and again was destroyed. The Imperial Legion helped Orc refugees escape to Skyrim. For this Orcs now have become more friendly with the Empire and have joined the Legion once ready to leave their stronghold.


Orsinium is now relocated between Skyrim and Hammerfell.

What we know is that it’s an extremely powerful artefact with colossal magika potential. It was discovered by the Nords when building Saarthal, and both they and the Falmer wanted it for its extreme power. It was buried by Ysgramor and left hidden until 4E 201 when it is a significant part of the College questline. The Thalmor want it, it baffles the Synod and College mages and has some kind of link to the Staff of Magnus. The Psijiic Order was already aware or semi-aware of its presence and wants to keep it out of the reach of the Thalmor.

**Origins**

Seeing as both the Nords and Falmer had no knowledge of the Eye before it was discovered by accident, and the runes aren’t Dwemer runes, it’s extremely unlikely that any civilisation built the Eye. The only other way it could come into being is if it was created – deliberately or otherwise – by the Aedra during some part of the creation of Nirn.

My theory is that Magnus was tricked or partially tricked into making the Eye. He was quite intelligent even by the standards of the gods (as he is said to be the one who designed the mortal plane). The Aedra commissioned Magnus to make the Eye for some purpose (which I’ll hypothesize on later). They tricked him either into placing some of his divinity into the Eye, or forcefully stole some of his divinity for the Eye. After this event, Magnus fled Mundus back to Aetherius, creating the sun and allowing magika to flow into the world.

**Purpose**

Again, we know nothing about this. I reckon that it was designed to either allow magika into Mundus, or as a stone similar to that of the stones that uphold (or used to) the towers. The Dwemer oculory, when used to project the location of magically powerful objects by using the link of the sun and stars shows the location of the Eye and Staff due to the Eye being tampered with by Ancano. This lends some credibility to the thought that it is linked to the magika flowing into Mundus as it’s so powerful that it blocks out the visibility of every other artefact (minus the Staff). We know it’s linked to magika in some way as it gives Ancano tremendous power when he tampers with it correctly.

We could also think of the Eye as the stone of Snow-Throat, but the only reasons we have for this are that it’s in Skyrim and it’s powerful.

**Tampering and link with the Staff**

From the events of Skyrim, we know that both magika and the Staff of Magnus can be used to tamper with the Eye. I don’t think that the Staff was made by Magnus the god, but by a very powerful mage who had knowledge of the Eye. In this theory, the Staff is a tampering tool for the Eye in the same way that Sunder, Keening or Wraithguard is to the Heart of Lorkhan. If we assume that tampering with such artefacts can only be done in a similar way to how Kagrenac did it (two tools and a protector) then I’d say that the Staff and magika are the equivalent to Keening and Sunder. For this to be true, there would have to be a Wraithguard equivalent. This could be a protective type of spell, the metallic walls that surround the Eye, or something we don’t know of yet. I think the runes themselves on the Eye may be the key, and that the third item in this case isn’t a physical object, but is knowledge – the runes could tell those who can analyse them correctly how to tamper with the heart correctly.

I assume that, once someone has learned the meaning of the runes on the Eye to a certain extent, and wields appropriate magic and the Staff, they could use the Eye to attain semi-godhood in the same way the Almsivi and Dagoth Ur did. However, Dagoth Ur didn’t use Wraithguard when he tampered with the Heart if I remember correctly, and that lead to severe defects such as insanity. Ancano did not have the Staff with him when he tampered with the Eye, meaning he only had two of the pieces needed to tamper with the Eye. This did give him great power, but he appears to lose his sanity along with it.

Magnus the mage was possibly the first to attempt serious tampering with the Eye. Little is known about him, but I’d assume he’s a Nord due to the Eye being discovered first by them. His fate, too, is not known but is probably linked to the Eye and Staff. I think that he, along with other mages in Saarthal attempted to tamper with the Eye and something went wrong, which is what lead to the burying of the Eye. Seeing as the Staff is said to contain the power of Magnus, it’s possible that the Staff consumed him when he attempted to tamper with the Eye incorrectly.

**Link to the Throat of the World**

Again, there’s no evidence for this but it’s possible. As the Thalmor are keen to destroy Mundus, and a way of doing this is by deactivating all the towers (and I recall hearing that a minimum of two must remain active for Mundus to be sustained). Obviously then the Thalmor would have high interest in destroying or otherwise disabling the Eye if it is indeed the stone of Snow-Throat, and this is possibly what Ancano was trying to do when he was tampering with the Eye. My reasoning for this is that he tries to distract the mages of the College by spawning anomalies in Winterhold and creating powerful barriers that only the Staff could undo, which would have usually given him time to destroy the Eye (he also says something about being able to destroy the world but I can’t remember the quote exactly). If it’s true that two towers need to be active for Mundus to stay up, then it would make sense that Ancano would try to destroy it and not use it, as the only other active tower is Direnni Tower. This could also be the reason that the Psijiics took the Eye out of the reach of the Thalmor, as they have no way to undo the Convention as of yet.

**To sum** everything up, I theorise that the Eye of Magnus is potentially the stone of the tower Snow-Throat, and can be tampered in a way like the Heart of Lorkhan can be with the Staff, knowledge and magic. Many are keen to abuse it like the Almsivi did the Heart, or destroy it to undo Mundus, and this is why the Psijiics are keen to move it.

As I said before, feel free to batter this in every way as I’m no lore expert, and this is just something I thought up when bored one afternoon.

**SECTION I: GENERAL**

**What is *The Elder Scrolls*?**

*The Elder Scrolls* is a long-running series of video games. The series began in 1994 with the release of *The Elder Scrolls: Arena*, and with each instalment grows more and more popular. *The Elder Scrolls* is renowned for offering what most RPG's do not - a huge background of information regarding the setting of the games, which is called ""lore"". This subreddit involves itself exclusively with the lore of *The Elder Scrolls*, rather than the games themselves.

**What does ""lore"" mean?**

The term ""lore"", in this context, means the backstory and background of a fictional universe. In this case, obviously, the fictional universe is that of *The Elder Scrolls*. TES lore is immensely vast, and as you dig through it all you'll notice it gets weirder and weirder as you go.

TES lore is unique in that it's completely subjective - nothing is 100% known or factual. It is this attribute that helps make it so great. Through years of discussion, the lore is adapted and moulded, and sometimes it is even created. There is a name for such created content: ""monkeytruth"" - content in lore that has been assumed or invented and cannot inherently be proven wrong, and is therefore right.

**If lore can't be strictly canon or non-canon, how do we tell what's right and what's not?**

You can't. TES lore, as previously stated, is completely subjective. It essentially means that any individual is free to consider parts of the lore ""true"" or ""untrue"" at will, depending on what they'd like. Of course, some parts of the lore are much less controversial than others. For example, some will consider lore that can't be found in the TES games ""non-canon"", often due to the strangeness and unfamiliar concepts of it that is far from what they can see in the games.

Here at [/r/teslore](/r/teslore), comments explaining that a part of the lore is ""non-canon"" is not allowed. Given that lore is subjective, telling others how it should be interpreted is wrong, as they are free to decide themselves. The same goes for comments saying things like ""I don't consider this canon"" where it is irrelevant, as it doesn't contribute to discussion.

**What is [/r/teslore](/r/teslore) all about?**

Here at r/teslore, we offer a place for intelligent and thoughtful discussion regarding everything about the lore of *The Elder Scrolls*. Questions, theories, and everything similar are welcomed here, and anyone with any level of comprehension of the lore can post.

**Who writes the lore?**

Nobody in particular writes the lore; it is a collective effort of many developers at Bethesda. One in particular, however, is known to be a driving force behind it - Michael Kirkbride, often known simply as ""MK"". Though no longer a formal employee of Bethesda's, he continues to write lore through posts on the official forums. You'll likely recognize his work when you can't make head nor tail of it at first glance - MK is infamous for producing cryptic pieces of literature that introduce weird and wonderful concepts into TES. In fact, the strangeness of his work and his informal position at Bethesda are often points for contention regarding the legitimacy of his contributions, and some consider his work non-canon. It is likely you will have a hard time dissuading a lore buff from accepting his work, though.

**Where can I find information about the lore?**

Your first stop should always be [The Imperial Library](http://imperial-library.info/), which is run by the most buff of lore-buffs and supported by Bethesda. The [UESP](http://www.uesp.net/), whilst fantastic for everything game-specific, isn't great for lore. Another great place is the lore section over at [the official forums](http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/16-elder-scrolls-lore/). Frequents over there have knowledge that, I shamelessly admit, far outranks any of us at [/r/teslore](/r/teslore). If no one can answer a question here, they can. A quick search on a topic of interest over there will also yield some good discussions.

**I'm new to TES lore. Where should I begin?**

Lady Nerevar (librarian at The Imperial Library for those that don't know) wrote a guide on ""[How to Become a Lore Buff](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1112211-how-to-become-a-lore-buff/)"", which is a must-read for anyone. It provides a well-rounded look at almost all aspects of lore, and goes just in-depth enough for you to decide whether you're interested in specific topics or not. She has also generously linked to further reading on each topic. In the guide, Lady Nerevar links to [Nigedo's Elder Scrolls Lore FAQ](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/15282-elder-scrolls-lore-faq/), which is also a great read. Both of these essentially render a lot of this FAQ redundant, but hey, I have a lot of spare time.

**I'm not new to TES lore. How can I further my understanding and knowledge of it?**

Browse the official forums' [lore section](http://forums.bethsoft.com/forum/16-elder-scrolls-lore/) and search there for things that interest you. In-depth discussions are frequent over there, making for interesting reads for even the most well-versed of scholars. You can always go further into aspects of the lore you don't know so well by digging into texts at [The Imperial Library](http://imperial-library.info/), but chances are you won't be interested in the stuff you don't so well - that's *why* you don't know it well.

I've found that for the more metaphysical aspect of TES lore, which is easily the most intricate and mind-boggingly confusing, studying real-world religions, creation stories, deities etc. will prove to be surprisingly helpful. TES lore, at many times, takes inspiration from real-world religions and therefore often bears resemblance to them. Understanding even the basics of things such as Buddhism and Taoism will give you a bit of an edge.

**How do I get dashing flair like yours, Prince-of-Plots?**

The are two symbols given as flair - the Imperial Dragon, given to members of the Elder Council (flash name for the moderating team) and the Penitus Oculatus symbol, given to members of the, well, Penitus Oculatus.

The Penitus Oculatus, on [/r/teslore](/r/teslore), is a collection of redditors that have both contributed significantly to the subreddit and who have proved a solid and credible knowledge of TES lore. Their flair is given both as a reward to those members, and as a sign to other members that they know their shit.

Induction into the Penitus Oculatus comes when a member of the Elder Council notices you and thinks you deserve it. They'll nominate you, and the other mods will look at you and voice their opinion. All Elder Councillors must agree - a single ""no"" is a veto. If all agree, you'll be sent a message notifying you and asking if you'd like to be a member of the Penitus Oculatus.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,True,,Council,True,t3_p5x2f,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/p5x2f/official_faq/,moderator

I figured it would be a good idea to have a quick Public Service Announcement concerning a recent topic that has been brought up in several threads, that is **whether an in universe story should be posted in /r/teslore or /r/talesfromtamriel**

The common argument for stories to be posted exclusively in /r/talesfromtamriel concerns the fact that /r/teslore is supposed to be a lore discussion-only subreddit while /r/talesfromtamriel is the home of in-universe fan fiction. This is a bad assumption.

In truth, there are many stories that both fit under the subreddit guidelines and heavily contribute to the subreddit. These are what some call ""Lore Stories"", which differ greatly from what others may call ""fan fiction."" What is the difference you ask?

**Fan Fiction**

when in the context of Elder Scrolls, is any in-universe story that holds the purpose of simply being an enjoyable story to read. Most ES fan fictions use elements from the Elder Scrolls games and universe to deliver some sort of thrilling (or arousing for some in some cases I'm not going to mention) tale involving characters that are relevant to Elder Scrolls. These stories are mostly written for fun and sometimes to show off one's narrative writing skills, but are not aimed at educating or giving anyone a wide perspective at the lore and world of Elder Scrolls. As such, they fit the guidelines of /r/talesfromtamriel and should be posted there.

 Some examples of these stories might be [Ancestor's Wrath](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/187ojr/ancestors_wrath_a_dunmer_dragonborn/) and [The Man in Black](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtamriel/comments/x2dzw/the_man_in_black/)

**Lore Stories**

differ from fan fiction in that they are read not only to entertain one with a thrilling narrative but also to educate one on the lore of the ES universe. Of course, these stories can also be well written and enjoyable narratives, but at their core their purpose is to give one a look into the working of the lore and elements within it. As such, while still being in-universe stories, they still fit the guidelines of /r/teslore and may be posted in the subreddit.

A couple of examples of these are [The Raid on Pyandonea](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170264/raid_on_pyandonea/) (which, by the way, is one of the greatest threads posted on the subreddit, and thus would be a shame to restrict) and [The Withering](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19fr2u/the_withering/).

Orcs all have basically the same name. Given name, prefix-surname. Very simple, very universal. I like that about the Orcs. Gives them a big sense of community, though not variety, that other races just don't quite have.

# Lore

Known Orcish names consist of the Orc's own name, followed by gro-Father or gra-Mother, depending on the Orc's gender.

This can be seen in *Skyrim* in the case of siblings Moth gro-Bagol and Ghorza gra-Bagol.

There are anomalies to this pattern, however. -Largash and -Dushnikh are both surnames of Orcs. Largash is from the Largashbur Stronghold, and Dushnikh from Dushnikh Yal. 

One of these characters (I believe the gra-Dushnikh one, but I don't remember) is known to have a mother, but the father is not made clear to the PC. The character is female, and so her surname should be the mother's name, not the Stronghold. However, the Orc in question had left the Stronghold and her mother, so perhaps she took the Stronghold name as a way to identify herself by tribe while distancing herself from her immediate family.

Elves in general do not seem to use familial names. Altmer and Bosmer are almost universally only given one name. Dunmer have House names, but it is common for the unaffiliated to have one name or a second name that is unconnected to their family. Orsimer have the only clearly familial naming tradition of the elves, yet even so keep it limited.

Identifying an Orc by their parent or tribe serves as a convenient way to make short associations, and can even be used to trace lineage, though this is painstaking. We have not seen much of Orcish familial life, but I believe that their strongly tribal culture means that children are raised collectively, and the patronymic or matronymic serves as a means of identifying which Orc belongs with which parent at the end of the day, though they are all grouped together otherwise.

Stronghold names would be adopted by orphans or those who were casting off their parents.
____
Now onto the language.

Orcs have their own ""language"" in *Daggerfall,* though this is just a value check in the game mechanics, so I am not going to use it.

Orc names are almost always mono- or bi- syllabic. It is very rare for their names to exceed two syllables per name. Notable examples are in Strongholds (Lar-gash-bur, Nar-zul-bur) and a few Orcish names (Dush-na-mub). However, one and two syllable names are the rule.

Next up, phonemes. Every race has a subset of the common alphabet from which they draw their typical names. Orcs favor oral consonants. They are not guttural, but also rarely labial. Consonants such as D, K, Z, G, N, R, and L are the most commonly used. All of these are formed by manipulating the shape of the mouth and the position of the tongue.

Interestingly, the vowel E is rarely encountered in Orcish names. On the UESP page Lore:Orc_Names, the letter E occurs in the names all of four times. I is slightly more common, but not by much. A, O, and U dominate the vowel population, and never occur as diphthongs. Y occurs solely as a consonant.
____
(Applies only to /r/Orsimer and the TSG)

If you need to make an Orcish name, I recommend perusing http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orc_Names). Combinations of consonants, with vowels placed to make syllables so the name can be pronounced, are the norm.

From general observation, feminine names have more vowels and syllable breaks, and less consonants per syllable, than do masculine names. The name in my flair, Krognaz gro-Makoza, is male for the given name and female for the surname. I don't know how well that came across, but I'm rather proud of it.

So, the dragon cult ruled over ancient Skyrim until the dragon war happened, the capital of Skyrim at this time was Bromjunaar (lit. North Light Servant or North King Slave) which is known today as Labryinthian.

Bromjunaar is actually quite telling, it reveals that the Dragoncult had advanced knowledge of Time, since they created the Wooden Mask that takes you back ~~a thousand years~~ a really long time. It also appears the Mask Hall is the precursor to the Moot, the eight dragon priests of Skyrim would place their masks on the pedestal to elect their king, Konahrik (lit. Warlord.)

In addition to their powerful Chronomancy the dragon cult features strong Necromancy. The Dragon Priests as we all know are powerful liches and were powerful enough that they actually binded their flock and were buried with them. We know that in order to become a lich the necromancer must transfer his soul into an outside object, and I believe in this case the outside object is the mask that dragon priests wear.

So on top of the Chronomancy and the Necromancy there was also a massive amount of human sacrifice. According to Tolfdir the cult sacrificed people every day, probably for use in their necromantic rituals.

I’ve seen the idea of Serpent Breaks thrown around the BGS forums and it seemed nobody ever really dug into them and their possible relation to Dragon Breaks.

Now I started thinking about this when I was trying to rationalize the lore (or anticipated breaks in lore if they were to happen) in ESO, which will be my main example for the purpose of this theory. Now as we know Dragon Breaks allow for all kinds of crazy things to happen. I obviously started looking for a Dragon Break to reconcile any revealed or yet to be revealed lore breaks. Well I couldn't find anything until I made a connection in my head.

Now in our world (bare with me on this) it’s considered that time and space are intrinsically tied together. I postulate that the same applies to TES, but for entirely different reasons. 

As we know Aka (Dragon) and Lorkhan (Serpent) are two sides of the same coin, the coin being the Godhead’s psyche. We see their duality in many things and personas. So via this dichotomy, I further postulate that if you break one, you break the other.

We see in ESO that Molag Bal is trying to merge Nirn and Coldharbour via the Dark Anchors. One space is literally prying it’s way into another. An impossible idea. But as we know, breaking time is another impossible idea. So, in essense, Molag Bal is breaking space. A Serpent Break.

So if we apply my above theory to ESO, we have an “indirect” Dragon Break via a Serpent Break. Thus allowing for multiple outcomes, millions of “heroes” doing the same quest lines and the like. 

Now to take this even further, assuming all the above is on point and correct, we can apply this to the unholy “transcription error” **(not that I enjoy it or even agree with it, CHIM is esoteric enough to apply this theory to it).** When Tiber changed the landscape of Cyrodiil, he broke the Serpent, thus breaking the Dragon and making it so Cyrodiil was always a temperate climate. Now I don't enjoy applying this theory to this event, but I figured, for the sake of argument I would.

After receiving the Bands of the Chosen from a Dremora in Camoran's paradise, Mankar says

&gt;How little you understand! You cannot stop Lord Dagon. The Principalities have sparkled as gems in the black reaches of Oblivion since the First Morning. Many are their names and the names of their masters: the Coldharbour of Meridia, Peryite's Quagmire, the ten Moonshadows of Mephala, and... and Dawn's Beauty, the Princedom of Lorkhan... misnamed 'Tamriel' by deluded mortals.
    Yes, you understand now. Tamriel is just one more Daedric realm of Oblivion, long since lost to its Prince when he was betrayed by those that served him. Lord Dagon cannot invade Tamriel, his birthright! He comes to liberate the Occupied Lands!


Since Michael Kirkbride wrote all his dialogue, I have a hard time believing him messing up the realms of the princes named was anything but intentional. Now, it could be just to show how crazy he is, but I've noticed that:

Meridia, a rather stuck-up sort-of-Daedroth who basically boils down to ""All undead must die....again."", is attributed to Coldharbour, realm of Molag Bal, creator of Vampires (which he created out of spite for Arkay, the aedra associated with life and death) and was at the very least involved in the creation of Soul Gems.

Peryite, Prince of order (and pestilence, but I see that as an extension of his nature as prince of order), is attributed to a realm so chaotic it's basically the Oblivion-Realm equivalent of a person in the Dawn Era (if the Bosmer are to be believed.) (It has no true form, it constantly shifts in appearance)

Mephala is attributed to Moonshadow.

Here is a description of Moonshadow from The Doors Of Oblivion:

&gt;'Too much beauty,' Zenas gasped when he went to the next realm. 'I am half blind. I see flowers and waterfalls, majestic trees, a city of silver, but it is all a blur. The colors run like water. It's raining now, and the wind smells like perfume. This surely is Moonshadow, where Azura dwells.'


Now, this is a little more desperate than the others.

To oversimplify things, we're pretty sure the Dark Brotherhood's ""Sithis"" is actually either Mephala screwing with them by acting as the Night Mother. Got it? Now, since Lucien Lachance claims to have been in the Void as the Spectral Assassin in Skyrim, it probably exists.

Since Mephala's realm is pretty much off-limits to mortals, it can be assumed that the Void (the one Lucien talks about)=Mephala's realm. From what I gather, the Void is cold, bleak, black, and generally unpleasant to non-assassins (and assassins too, probably). Pretty much the polar opposite of Moonshadow.


ANYWAY, I noticed all this crap and its 4:45 in the morning here and I'm probably sleep-deprived but I was wondering if anybody had any thoughts on this, and what possible significance could there be in Mankar Camoran claiming this crap. Also, he worships a Daedric Prince sometimes called the Prince of Change, so there is that.

EDIT: I like thenighthawker's explanation for Mephala.

&gt;Moonshadow is so beautiful that it is blinding. Mephala's realm is completely obscured, it doesn't even have a known name.

So here's the ugly, followed by the link.
____
It's not hidden that the Altmer are among (if not the) most disliked race. Why? The Altmer are tied to the Thalmor and a few other individuals that come across as rude, but not all Altmer have these same stereotypical traits. Many people link the Altmer to the Thalmor, but in actuality not many Altmer actually agree with the Thalmor

For an example, here is a sample of Altmer in Skyrim that don't fit this stereotype:

* Ulundil: runs the Windhelm Stables; among the most friendly NPC's in Skyrim

* Legate Fasendil: Imperial Legate that makes camp in The Rift; strongly dislikes the Thalmor

* Nelecar: resides in Winterhold in The Frozen Hearth Inn; helps helps player in The Black Star quest

* Calcelmo: Resides in The Underkeep in Markarth; comes across as rude when you first meet him but you get to see his nice side during the several quests he's in.

* Aicantar: friendly nephew of Calcelmo

* Viarmo: headmaster of the Bards College in Solitude

* Faralda: apart of the College in Winterhold 

* Nenya: steward to the Jarl of Falkreath 


Something to take into account is that not all Altmer agree with the Thalmor's opinions, actually there are indications that a vast number of Altmer in the Summerset Isles don't agree with the Thalmor. In the in-game book Rising Threat the Altmer author (Lathenil), outwardly talks about the corruption of the Thalmor. Lathenil talks about how the people of The Summerset Isles were ""tricked"" into welcoming the Thalmor and allowing them to expand their presence in the isles . During the Oblivion crisis the Thalmor helped save the Isles and they shut all the Oblivion Gates in the Isles for good. After the crisis the Thalmor were looked up to and allowed to join the Isle's government.

&gt;Before my numbed mind could comprehend the tumult that consumed my beloved Summerset Isle, before I could formulate the question ""how?"" they were there, dripping honeyed poison in our ears: the Thalmor. They were the ones that saved us, they claimed, working deep and subtle magicks. It was their efforts, their sacrifices that delivered the Altmer from extinction. Oh, what fools we were. We wanted so desperately someone to thank for ending our tribulations, we lavished it upon the first to step up and claim the glory. With that simple act of gratitude, we allowed a vile rot to seep into our homeland, to putrefy our once noble and distinguished civilization.

&gt;But the people of the Isles soon realized that they had made a terrible mistake of letting the Thalmor into their government, they began to see the Thalmor's true intentions. Soon after the Thalmor had control of the Isles they expanded to forcibly take control of Valenwood to recreate the Aldmeri Dominion, soon Elsweyr joined (on their own accord) the Dominion. 

&gt;Ever so cautiously, I formed a cabal made up of others who distrusted the motives and methods of the Thalmor. Over several months, I liquidated my ancestral holdings and took whatever inheritance I could without raising any suspicions. I would follow after Rynandor and help him restore his reputation and status. We would then return to best the Thalmor at their own game and win back the mores and morals of the Altmer! The rest of my cabal would stay on Summerset Isle and win the trust of the Thalmor on whatever level best suited each of them, sending clandestine missives to me when possible.

It's safe to assume that many citizens of the Isles were secretly against the Thalmor, but they feared for their own life to publicly express their concern and hatred of the Thalmor. If you speak to Legate Fasendil he will tell you about the Night of Green Fire, he tells you:

&gt;""Back in 42 I was stationed in Hammerfell, on leave in Sentinel, trying to trace down some refugee relative who had fled persecution in Alinor. Suddenly an explosion of magic in the refugee quarter, Thalmor mages were attacking the Altmer dissidents who were resisting with magic of their own. I ran to the scene with other Legionaries who were stationed there, but the entire quarter was a smoking ruin by the time we arrived. Everyone was dead. Wholesale slaughter. The Dominion, not content with killing dissidents at home, came to Hammerfell to finish the job.""

There were Altmer who have decided to risk their lives to escape the Isles from the Thalmor, but they were killed by their own kind...The Thalmor, the group who refers as themselves as the ""Saviors of Mer"". It's very evident that not all Altmer agree with the Thalmors agenda, I wouldn't be surprised if at least 70% of the Isles population are against the Thalmor.

## In addition:

The Altmer have been a great driving force behind many off the modern advancements within Tamriel. The Altmer are widely known for their capabilities in architecture and in the arts, thanks to the Altmer culture widely involving the arts and due to the Altmers' long lifespans (approximately 500-800), they are able to perfect their abilities. Not only have the Altmer influenced Tamriel's modern arts and architecture, they have lended their vast knowledge in math and science. There are also many historians in Tamriel who happen to be Altmer who have furthered the knowledge in all Tamriel.

Names have no meaning.

.

The two Altmer walked along the rough path. They were heading deep into the woods east of the Niben Bay, where scouts had finally tracked the traitor. The lanky Justiciar emptied his mind as they plodded forward, pulling all his magicka reserves up and readying them. His partner, a great brute of a soldier, walked ahead of him, guiding him down the path so his mind could fully prepare for what was sure to be an uproarious battle. They climbed a small hill, and several things happened at once.

They saw a shack, small and secluded beneath a great tree. From the shack burst a light, and power radiated out of it, streaming away into the air. It snapped the Justiciar to; he readied a spell and hissed to the solider ""Get down!"" But as soon as the light had come, it was gone. Cautiously, the pair approached the shack. Just as the soldier made to force the door in, a tired voice sounded from within, saying ""Come in, then."" The two exchanged a surprised look, then opened the door. Sitting there amidst piles of books were three large chairs, one of which was occupied. Staring up at the two was an incredibly old-looking Altmer.

""Please, young mage,"" he said, ""still your spells. Or are you so oblivious that you cannot see that I have no strength left to resist you?"" The Justiciar reluctantly let the magicka slip back from his fingertips, but the soldier kept his sword drawn, and raised as if to strike the old mer. There was a twinkle in his eyes, despite his apparent exhaustion. He motioned to the chairs. ""Sit, please. All this taking and breaking in is such tiring work. Rest for a moment, and explain who sent you. For I am curious which will win out, my being kin, or my being a Blade.""

The Justiciar spoke up, ""We are here on orders from Alinor. You are to be brought back for reeducation, as your rebellion has been a thorn in our sides for too long."" The old elf chuckled. ""A fair assessment, I suppose, glossing over the major details as usual. Your Thalmor's never been a group for details, only results. Wine?"" At this, he made to grab a glass bottle on the floor by his chair, but the soldier saw his movement and stepped forward. The old elf's eyes darted to the blade as it came down, and with a swift movement, he knocked the blow aside, embedding the soldier's sword in his floorboards. ""Honestly, you great buffoon, if I had the strength left to kill you, I would have. Your damn scout's already took too much out of me as it is."" He picked up the bottle and motioned behind his chair. A Thalmor scout lay there, dead, and oddly pale. ""Now then, shall I drink alone?""

The Justiciar reluctantly sank into the chair closest to the door, and forced the soldier to the chair between him and the old elf. The soldier refused wine, but the Justiciar reluctantly agreed, provided he saw the old elf drink first. He did, but even so, he cast a few spells to detect poisons, but found nothing. This amused the old elf. ""It's vintage 3E401, you fool. Not even the most cruel-hearted of assassins would dare add anything to this masterpiece. In fact, this is my last bottle. Smuggled it out of the Summurset Isles myself. Oh, I mean, out of *Alinor* myself. Of course."" 

""Now then, down to business."" He set his glass down, and with obvious effort, cast a little, flickering candlelight above them. ""You're here to take me back, and well enough. It's been too long since I've gazed upon the best our culture has to offer, but I suppose we won't be going through Valenwood then, shall we? And I suppose you'll want me to... oh, what is that phrase... ah! *Come quietly*, as it were?"" Something about the old elf's tone set the Justiciar on edge. ""Enough talk, we're going now."" Even as the words dribbled out of his mouth, they fell flat to the floor. The old elf pressed on, ""Oh, but must we? There's so much I want to hear propaganda about, and I must finish off that vintage. Oh, but I suppose you must believe our homeland's always been Alinor, am I right, whelp? Are you even old enough to wear those robes, boy?""

The Justiciar bristled. ""I am one-hundred forty and seven years old, and I daresay I've been taught more about magic than you've ever forgotten, you old fool!"" The soldier was silent, knowing that if he restrained his partner there would be punishment later. ""One hundred forty-seven years old, eh? I've lived four of your lives, and I'm damned close to a fifth. 'Learned more than I've forgotten indeed'... I suppose you know the answer to the oh-so-important question of the Khajiit, then, yes? Was your little experiment worth it?"" A befuddled look came over the Justiciar's face. ""Experiment?"" he asked, ""What experiment are you talking about?""

The old elf's eyes twitched to the body of the slain scout for the smallest of moments, and he cracked a wry smile. ""So, they never told you young ones, then. Khajiit were mer once, if you can believe it. Your Thalmor experimented on them to see if making the moons disappear would make them revert to Aldmer, only I suppose they failed, as per usual, seeing as Void Nights Khajiit are still beasts, not mer."" The Justiciar stared in disbelief. ""That's... ridiculous. I've had quite enough of your stories, old fool. It's time to go!"" And with that, he and his partner rose as if it had been agreed upon beforehand. His partner worked his sword out of the floor. But the old elf sat quite still, pensively sipping his wine. The Justiciar pulled magicka down and readied a spell of binding. ""Get up, you old fool, it's time to go!""

The old elf looked up at him. Their eyes locked for the briefest of moments. He threw his glass, wine and all, into the face of the Justiciar. Even as the Justiciar cried out in pain, the soldier's sword found itself embedded in the old elf's chest.

To the amazement of the soldier, he smiled. ""So... Now, you've actually... actually done it. Damn fools..."" He choked, even as blood began to flow from his chest. The Justiciar raked him with lightning in his rage, before casting a spell of binding on him. They set a fire in the shack after combing through it for texts the old Blade would have found useful, and began their slow trek back to the prison below the Bay. A quick healing potion fixed the Justiciar's problems, and every so often he would stop to have the soldier beat the old elf. The spell of binding would keep him alive until his use was ended. Sometimes the beatings lasted for ten minutes or more. It wasn't until midmorning that the odd trio finally reached the shores of the Niben Bay. They brought him to the prison beneath the Bay, where he was questioned thoroughly by the best torturers in the Dominion. It was decided that he could not be sent to Alinor due to the actions of the pair, and they were sent in his place for reeducation.

But the old elf began to fade. The torture began to weaken the spell of binding, and each day he felt himself slipping further and further. Finally, after an endless reality of torture, he broke.

A scribe was brought in, and what follows is his account of the confession of the last Altmer Blade:

&gt;""Prisoner 093471: I killed him. Broke his soul. Used it to tell them... Told Cloud Ruler. They sent word to the Eagle in the North. He'll move... catch the Bear as he sleeps... Our agent is there. Our agent will be there. But your fools... Your stupid fools let me send the... the message. Too willing to listen. For shame, you great bunch of fetch-

&gt;[the prisoner is beaten with a club covered in leather. non-standard torture equipment. may have contributed to death.]

&gt;Torturer: Who is your agent? Where will he be?

&gt;[the prisoner was spitting out blood and bits of bone, to account for the pauses in this report. breathing was labored. E did not intervene.]

&gt;P093471: Couldn't say. Never met them. Orphaned. You bastards killed the family... Don't recall a bit of it, so I heard... Raised the poor fool... Never told who we are. Can't, cause you bastards'd hunt us down... We... We're all prey. But our agent's going to break your thrice-damned neck. You'll stick it out too far, and our agent'll crush it neath a great boot of iron!

&gt;[at this point, the prisoner spit in the torturer's face. in response, the torturer struck the prisoner repeatedly. a breaking sound was heard. assumed jaw fracture in four locations.]

&gt;E: I think we've heard enough. This damned traitor has been working against us for far too long, and our evidence against him is quite substantial. Besides, you got overly enthusiastic on your last swing, see? You broke his jaw, you fool. We'll deal with this after. 

&gt;[at this point, one of the guards stepped forward and cut prisoner's throat. all were escorted out of the room. prisoner died soon after, due to suffocation on his own fluids. cutting the throat had negligible effect. must be more careful during torture. recommending this account to be reviewed by Alinor.]""",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1355282760.0,,,True,t3_14ojmd,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14ojmd/the_role_of_the_bladesinhiding_leading_up_to_the/,

&gt;*""Now, I'm new here, so I don't know what this subreddit used to be like, but if new members are changing the tone of this place the mods have two options. First, they can just let the subreddit evolve into something new, and risk alienating older members. Or they can crack down on ""bad"" posts, similar to what askscience does, and hope new members learn the culture of this board. Both options have pros and cons, but I expect the established community would prefer the latter.""*

Indeed, myself and the other moderators have decided to take that second option. /r/teslore will see much stricter moderation than before in an effort to guide its content back on track and maintain the quality that the subscribers want. In particular, this is what changes:

* All threads must be looked at by a moderator. If it matches the standard held by /r/teslore, it will be marked as approved. Otherwise, it will be removed and the poster will be notified of the reason.

* Individual comments that stray too far from lore will be removed.

* People that ask questions that already answered in the FAQ will be directed to it, and then the thread should be removed. After all, the frequently asked questions are deemed as such for a reason. However, if the poster has made it clear that they have already read the FAQ, it would be obvious they're looking for further clarification, which is completely fine (and encouraged).

That's what will change in our moderation, but we hope that you'll be making a change, too. We strongly encourage the use of:

* Upvotes/downvotes. If possible, vote on every thread you come across. If the thread is of a good standard, upvote it, and if it isn't, downvote it. It's simple enough, but in numbers, as this is a small subreddit, will be very effective. Good posts will decorate the front page, and bad posts will never see the light of day.

* Reports. As well as downvoting content, anyone can report it if they think it should be outright removed. It's completely anonymous, and it'll get a moderator's attention, so we can look at the content and see whether we should get rid of it.

Finally, to aid us in increasing the level of moderation on /r/teslore, [xenoposeidon](/u/xenoposeidon) has joined the moderating team. He's been hanging around here for a long time, consistently providing us with good Argonian lore, and we feel he's perfect for the position.

&gt; * Six are the formulas to heaven by violence,

&gt; * Vivec said, 'Reach heaven by violence then.'

These are the ""six walking ways to reach heaven by violence"" that I believe Vivec laid out in his 36 lessons and that have been further fleshed out by MK's other works. The ones in **bold** are stuck to that number whilst the others are not:

1) The Prolix Tower/Hurling Disk

2) Dracochrysalis

3) **Scarab that transforms into the New Man**

4) **Mantling (Enantiomorph)**

5) **CHIM**

6) The Numidium

-----------------------------------------------------------------

To start I'll answer a few question about the walking ways.

**What are the Walking Ways?**

The six walking ways are the different ways of ascending to Godhood and further (which I'll explain at the end).

**Where did you get the different walking ways from?**

I used the Loveletter and this quote mainly.

&gt;You in the Fourth Era have already witnessed many of the attempts at reaching the final subgradient of all AE, that state that exists beyond mortal death. The Numidium. The Endeavor. The Prolix Tower. CHIM. The Enantiomorph. The Scarab that Transforms into the New Man.

The failure that this quote refers is to do with reaching Amaranth rather than the Walking Ways and it specifically refers to how the Walking Ways are only a stepping-stone to Amaranth and the Walking Ways it mentions number 6 but they are not the same 6 as I presented. The difference is is that I've changed the Endeavour with Dracochrysalis because the Endeavor is the same thing as CHIM.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Now to go through the list and why I put what where.

1.a) The Prolix Tower.

There is no information on this whatsoever and the only mention of it is in the Mythic Dawn Commentaries and the Loveletter.

If I were to have to give a guess at it then I'd say that it is to ascend in a way so long-winded and boring that it is impossibly boring to explain (Prolix= long-winded - lengthy - verbose - diffuse - wordy).

1.b) The Hurling Disk

This is a way to reach heaven that is stated in the 36 lessons and in the book of hours. It is essentially to achieve divinity during a Dragon Break and especially the Middle Dawn.

&gt;In this world and others EIGHTEEN less one (the victor) is the magical disk, hurled to reach heaven by violence.

&gt; http://www.imperial-library.info/content/vehks-book-hours-concerning-dragon-break

There is a tenuous link between both of them and that is referring to an extract from the Mythic Dawn Commentaries which calls the Mnemoli as **Prolix** Gods and it is the Mnemoli who appear during Dragon Breaks.

2) Dracochrysalis.

I swapped the Endeavour out for this because that we have proof of a being ascending via this. He is Auri-El, God-King of the Aldmer and Dragon God of Time. When he was banned from re-attaining Godhood by Anu he led the Aldmer to victory over Lorkhan and then ascended in full-sight of the Aldmer:

&gt; Auri-El led the original Aldmer against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane. 

How do we know that it is by Dracochrysalis he ascended? because the Ald(t)mer followed in his footsteps in trying to ascend by creating the Crystal Tower in emulation of Ada-Mantia. Since we know that the Ald(t)mer practised Dracochrysalis from the Nu-Mantia Intercept:

&gt;Where the Altmer sought to focus on dracochrysalis.

What is Dracochrysalis itself?

This is my explanation of it:

&gt;First of all if we split the word into two we get ""Draco"" and ""Chrysalis"". Draco stands for Dragon and therefore time. Chrysalis is a reference to the cocoon stage of an insects life (vague, I know).

&gt;Therefore we have Time Cocoon. If you were to be in a Time Cocoon, time would stop effecting you, you would not grow older and the degeneration that effects the rest of Nirn would not effect you. This would keep you as ""pure"" as possible, something that the Ald(t)Mer are famous for.

&gt;So how do you ascend?

&gt;If you are successful enough at the Time-Cocoon you begin to reverse time. You begin to grow younger and purer and stronger until you finally reach Godhood/Divinity.

3) Scarab that transforms into the New Man

This is the Heart of Lorkhan under a cryptic name. It is the way the ALMSIVI/trinity ascended and it is described as the third walking way by Vivec:

&gt;Trinity in unity is the world and word of action: the third walking path.'

It is common knowledge that the Tribunal used the Heart of Lorkhan so I won't go into any more detail.

4)  Mantling (Enantiomorph)

This is the fourth walking way and it is the way the oversoul of Talos ascended, it is neatly summed up by the Tiber Septim himself: 

&gt; Tiber Septim: ""The Stormcrown manted by way of the fourth: the steps of the dead. Mantling and incarnation are separate roads; do not mistake this. The latter is built from the cobbles of drawn-bone destiny. The former: walk like them until they must walk like you. This is the death children bring as the Sons of Hora."" - [Nu-Hatta](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/nu-hatta-sphinxmoth-inquiry-tree)

5) CHIM

&gt;  Late is the lover that comes to this by any other walking way than the fifth, which is the number of the limit of this world. The lover is the highest country 

CHIM is the fifth walking way since it is [love](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pojhf/know_love/) and it is the fastest of the Walking Ways by which I mean it is an instantaneous achievement unlike the others. It is also the only way that leads past godhood but it is still not the furthest one can go. 

6) The Numidium

The creation of the Numidium was an attempt by the Dwemer to unite their souls into one and ascend as one people by use of the Heart of Lorkhan. This could be noted under (3) but I see it as a different way for some reason although in reality it may no be a way at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, what's the significance of the Walking Ways?

By following the Walking Ways one escapes the Kalpa. One does not need to worry about the World-Eaters giant gullet, for those who ascend via the Walking Ways are past mortal death and can look towards Amaranth.

At the end of the paths there is a jump a jump to Amaranth.

* The Tharn family has made a pact with the King of Worms, who has agreed to supplement the Imperial's forces by resurrecting their soldiers.

* Secretly, Mannimarco is conspiring with Molag Bal to take over Mundus.

* Molag Bal is harvesting souls of mortals, and the player is an adventurer whose soul has been taken, allowing them to constantly return to life.

* He's also sent ""Dark Anchors"" into Tamriel, which drag Mundus into Coldharbour. They're dark because he's a baddie, obviously. The Fighters Guild have taken it upon themselves to remove them.

* Three major groups have formed: The Aldmeri Dominion, consisting of Altmer, Bosmer, and Khajiit, control Alinor, Elsweyr, and Valenwood. The Daggerfall Covenant, consisting of Orcs, Bretons, and Redguards, control High Rock and Hammerfell. The Ebonheart Pact, consisting of Dunmer, Argonians, and Nords, control Skyrim, Morrowind, and Black Marsh.

* Time-travel will be featured in the game. In one example, the player throws on some old armor and is put in the owner's role, participating in a battle of long ago.

* Undead werewolves will be featured in the game.

* A werewolf named Faolchu has amassed a werewolf army and has taken over Camlorn, High Rock. For whatever reason, he has a weakness to fire.

* The Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Fighters and Mages Guilds are around.

* There will at some point be a battle for the Imperial City which is overrun by Daedra, deciding who will rule Tamriel.

The Sea of Ghosts

by [author's name not yet decided]
 
I have lived for a large part of my life in the city of Haafingar, capital of Haafinheim Hold and one of the greatest port cities in the land. Seafarers of all stripes can be found here; from Nord families working the same boatmaker’s trade since before the start of the Third Era, to  deckhands of every race making an all-too-short land visit before embarking once again to Anvil or Senchal. All are tied to the Sea of Ghosts, the icy and mist-wreathed waters that stretch north from the coast of Skyrim to the deserted land of Atmora.
 
Though more properly part of the Padomaic Ocean -- the body of water surrounding Tamriel -- the Sea of Ghosts has a curious name. It is a well-accepted belief, especially by those Nords that fish and sail these waters, that there is some sort of malign presence within to which can be attributed all related bad luck and calamity.
 
Intrigued by the matter, I was fortunate enough to seek out and be granted an audience with a former master of the Bards’ College, who recited for me a variety of related skjalds, or heroic songs. Several verses of his offered this explanation for the name:
 
*""... and so did Ysgramor lead out his banner’d longship force*

*from Atmora he sailed across the vast expanse of cold*

*retribution for the Night of Tears his grim face foretold*

*until his Companions and he would return to Skyrim’s shores*
 
*But their voyage was not easy and distant seemed the coast*

*Rough seas and stormy weather were the least of their concerns*

*from fog and ice did flicker pale and shimm’ring icy forms*

*his Companions far too stoic to succumb to mere ghosts...”*
 
He confided in me that though there was no evidence for such wraith-like creatures ever existing, he had heard a few sailors in their cups claim to have seen such apparitions out at sea; no two men’s recollections of the ‘ghosts’ ever matched, though, and it was widely regarded by most mariners as a symptom of exhaustion on an extended voyage, as accurate as tales of selkies or siren’s calls.
 
I found as much first-hand, when I made an attempt to interview sailors to hear for myself accounts of this phenomenon (an unpleasant and expensive task, that involved frequenting several of the seedier dockside taverns of the city, all of which over-costed and over-watered their ale): as I had been told before, most debunked the story as hallucinations borne of the fog and aurorae that hang over the waters at night.
 
I was party to other attempts at explaining the soubriquet, all of which were decidedly more mundane. One Redguard suggested that it was due to the sunken vessels the sea had claimed and the many sailors on them not yet laid to rest; another sailor, this a Nord, volunteered that the ‘ghosts’ referred to the restless spirits of those Atmorans slain by the cold and ice that reclaimed that ancient land. I was even fortunate enough to make conversation with a rare Cyrodified Altmer on a stopover from Firsthold, who grimly joked that the ghosts were sure to be those of the Aldmeri corpses of Skyrim’s first inhabitants, unceremoniously thrown into the waves in contempt!
 
Whatever the source of the ghosts, Nordic shipbuilders and sailors have distinct traditions for warding them away. It is typical for Nordic longships destined to sail out of sight of land to have at their prow a carving of a fierce creature or maiden-of-the-sea, a figurehead to frighten or becalm any hostile spirits of the water. Similarly, no ship will receive a name until it is taken for a first voyage and returned safely, thereby demonstrating the spirits’ disinterest in the demise of the vessel. As a result, all Nordic sailors are supremely confident in their chosen ship, satisfied that the artifice of Haafingar’s shipmakers will protect them not only from choppy waters and storms, but also the mysterious ghosts of the sea.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1375737168.0,,Psijic,True,t3_1jqhyy,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1jqhyy/the_sea_of_ghosts/,

So this theory has been banging around in my head for a while, I actually thought of it a while ago but never posted it.

I believe that Rune is actually a descendant of the Grey Fox. 

Oblivion Thieves Guild Questline Spoiler(?)
Perhaps he is not a direct descendant of the reformed Corvus Umbranox (the former guildmaster and Grey Fox), it could just be someone who took up the cowl later, but it is worth noting that Corvus and his wife are Imperials, as is Rune.

A [note](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_Word_Yet) (that can be found in the Ragged Flagon's cistern) detailing a researcher's failure to find any trace of Rune's parents specifically says that it is as though they had ""erased themselves from history.""

Donning the Grey Cowl of Nocturnal (the artifact that the Grey Fox must be in possession of) [erases its wearer's identity from history.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Instructions:_the_Gray_Cowl) 

The wording of the letter sent to Rune was oddly specific, which is mainly why I became so suspicious. I did some digging and found that during the Oblivion Thieves guild Questline, the Grey Fox himself asks the player to retrieve a runed stone called [Savilla's Stone](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/File:OB-icon-misc-Savilla%27sStone.png), which might be the stone that Rune was found with. 

And finally, Rune *is* a thief, (although he does claim that he started stealing to make ends meet) perhaps it's in his blood.

(Also it has been brought to my attention that (Major Oblivion Thieves Guild Questline Spoiler ahead!) during the end of the Thieves Guild Questline in Oblivion, Corvus did actually remove the curse of the cowl. Is it possible that Nocturnal reinstated it?)

So, do you think it's possible? I was really sad that he never got a quest.

Right now I just have parallels and coincidences to speculate about, so pardon my disjointed thoughts, I'm new at this.

I think there is some relation between Akatosh (manager of time) and H-M (daedric prince of knowledge and fate, fate being the effect of knowledge over time on the Mundus). It seems like in the lore that I've read (I'm just getting started) that the ""dragon blood"" is only given to men.  Is this true? 

H-M has a big interest in dragonborn mortals.  This parallel's Akatosh's agents being immortal dragons.  But H-M kept Miraak around for thousands of years as his champion.  Apocrypha contained dragons for him to enslave.  Where did H-M get them?  Much of the main quest in Skyrim involves searching for forgotten lore from sources unknown to present-day man.  The Skaal say that H-M was known to the Atmorans as the demon of knowledge - could the Dragon Cult have been his handiwork to enslave man, and Alduin (the dragon, not the world-eater entity) was following H-M's orders?

I just can't see it as a coincidence that H-M was behind so much of the corruption on Solstheim in Dragonborn.   Nothing this big is a coincidence or sideplot in TES.

I apologize for that, but Memospore has occupied a lot of my time lately.  With the recent dip in activity, I've been able to finish a project of mine, inspired by a conversation with Toesock, Neradac and Umpteen on IRC.

Many people feel a connection between Sermons 12 through 14, which outline the event known as the ""**Pomegranate Banquet**,"" and CHIM.  Partially this is because Sermon 12 is the first mention of the word ""CHIM,"" but there seems to be a stronger connection there, a metaphysical subtext that is not immediately obvious.

Later in the 36 Lessons, in Sermon 31, Vivec writes: ""[…] he recalled the Pomegranate Banquet, where he was forced to marry to Molag Bal with wet scriptures to cement his likeness as Mephala and write with black hands.""

Why was lying with Molag Bal a **requirement** to becoming the anticipation of Mephala?

There may be a thematic equivalency.  For example, if we consider [the figure inscribed on the Dark Brotherhood's door in Oblivion](http://images.uesp.net/9/93/OB-place-Sanctuary_Door.jpg) to be depicting Mephala, as is often suggested, it's possible that she is in the process of killing her children, much as Vivec does after the Banquet.  And sure, Mephala is the Daedric Prince of Sex and Murder, and that does sum up the Banquet quite well.

But there is a more interesting point here.  Consider [this quote from Sermon 11](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_11):

&gt;According to the Codes of Mephala, there is no difference between the **theorist** and the **terrorist**. Even the most cherished desire disappears in their hands. This is why Mephala has black hands. Bring both of yours to every argument. The one-handed king finds no remedy. When you approach God, however, cut both of them off. God has no need of theory and he is armored head to toe in terror.

Mepahala operates without desire.  She performs sex without lust and murder without fear.  And vice versa.  She is synchronous, in this respect, to Crowley's definition of Love Under Will: she seeks action without the desire for result.

To become a Ruling King, you must blacken your hands by becoming intimate with both Theory and Terror.  Logic and Hysteria, two chiral opposites.  Desire disappears in the hands of a Theorist, and fear does not exist in the hands of a Terrorist.    You become clear of mind and devoid of fear.

This could also be a part of the symbolism behind Vivec's title of ""Mastery.""  I'd argue that Almalexia, as the Warrior, controls the domain of **Terror**, or the Sword, and Sotha Sil controls the domain of **Reason**, or the Word.  Vivec controls both, which is why both of Mephala's hands are black.

This leads us at last to our connection with CHIM.  From [Vehk's Teaching, ""…the Tower.""](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tower)

&gt;How to permanently exist beyond duplexity, antithesis, or trouble. This is not an easy concept, I know. Imagine being able to feel with all of your senses the relentless alien terror that is God and your place in it, which is everywhere and therefore nowhere, and realizing that it means the total dissolution of your individuality into boundless being. Imagine that and then still being able to say “I”. The “I” is the Tower.

Facing down the Godhead requires incredible bravery because God is armored head to toe in terror.  Simply being in its presence is terrifying, and commanding all the **Terror** in the world will not aid you.  Neither will **Theory**, for CHIM is a form of self-delusion, as you are insisting that you exist despite inarguable evidence to the contrary, and this requires an argument based on a complete lack of reason.

Because Vivec has knowledge of both Terror and Logic, it's arguable that he was the only member of the Tribunal to attain CHIM.

An innocent question to a denizen of the Imperial Province, to be sure. But ask a provincial living in Skyrim, and he will respond, bemused, by pointing to the nearest bucket. Though shocking to the more refined citizens of the Empire, many rustics living on the fringes of civilization have never seen a proper toilet.

How then, do they survive? A cursory investigation carried out by Bryce et al (4E 187) was dismissive of Skyrim's sewage systems, calling the province ""a savage place... the streets run with effluent after a rain, in which children bathe happily, as their dead-eyed mothers look on.""

I find that though Skyrim does not possess the technical sophistication of Nibenay, there is much to appreciated in the simplicity and ingenuity of systems built without the full resources of the Empire.

**Leveraging Natural Advantages**

Whiterun typifies the Nord approach to sewage. The city is clean and vibrant, yet unlike our own Imperial City, there are no underground sewers or toilets.

That is because Whiterun was built on a hill for a reason. A well at the top serves the palace at Dragonsreach. From here water flows down into two sluices and finally into drains south into the White River. A second sluice also originates in the Cloud District and does the same.

The denizens of Whiterun use these sluices for sewage and sanitation. They empty chamber pots into the waters, which swiftly carry it far away from the city. The people here also use the water to wash clothes, bathe, drink, and cook. I would not advise a newcomer to drink directly from the water without first boiling it, but those who have lived in Whiterun for years have become accustomed to whatever minor maladies inhabit the slightly tainted water.

Of course there are drawbacks for those living in the Plains District. As they live nearest the end of the sluice, all the effluent and dirt passes through their quarter, making the water least safe here. 

**The Beam in Your Eye**

Overall, however, Whiterun is a healthy city well-supplied with water. Indeed the people here are more cleanly than those found in southern Nibenay, where cities like Bravil and Leyawiin have much to learn from the inventiveness of the Nords. 

The pools of standing water in these cities function more like cesspools than reservoirs. In Leyawiin, members of the guard are known to bathe *in the resevoir itself,* a disgusting proposition for those expected to carry the fouled water back home.

A system of airation like the slopes and falls in Whiterun's sluice system would go a long way to keeping the region's water potable. As the current administrator of Cyrodil's sewage system, Mister Bryce would do well to look at the shortcomings of his own jurisdiction before mocking model systems such as Whiterun's.

1358199407.0,45,self.teslore,16kp71,My Findings on Spriggans,Oliver1706,53,8,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16kp71/my_findings_on_spriggans/,"I, Throgyn Quilaren, a priest of Kyne, have encountered many of Spriggans in my travels. Here, I will record or I know about these mysterious Spriggans. However, some accounts are second hand, and spriggans often vary.

**Spriggan Behaviour**

Spriggans seem to be particularly hostile and suspicious of strangers. Spriggans mostly avoid the roads, and instead can be found in caves and forest. In Eldergleam Sanctuary, the spriggans seem to be quite accustomed to people probably because of many pilgrimages to see the great tree. Some, including myself, believe them to be creatures of Kyne, and serve her, by protecting her fantastic wilderness from invaders,

One theory is that  spriggans dislike technology and the destruction of their forests, and lash out at strangers. However, I do not believe this. In my experience, Spriggans are found occupying ruins or guarding places they deem important. When somebody invades this, they protect themselves.
To me, spriggans seem to be peaceful, but wish for the preservation of their precious natural beauty. Spriggans are able to call and control animals to do their bidding, such as bears. Spriggans of Solstheim also have the astounding ability to heal themselves. Whether this is a form of magic, or a natural regenerative property, it is quite impressive.

Spriggans also seem to have a unique language, but it is not well documented. It's origin are unknown, but it is unlikely that it is descended from Ehinofex.


**Spriggan Anatomy**

Spriggans have long, spiny claws, and a hard wooden exoskeleton. A soft glow emanates from them that fades upon their death. If one were to crack open the woody carcass, copious spriggan sap would be found. As a priest, I would never defile such a wonderful creature's body, but I have reports that it can alchemically enhance the users Alteration abilities. This seems to be of interest, as spriggans most certainly have some form of Alteration magic about them. The Wispmother, by Mathias Ettiene, shows that a member of the Synod believes that spriggans are simply spirits of what they represent, not physical creatures.

Also harvested from the spriggans body are two woods of alchemical significance. Heartwood, which I only seems to come from spriggans of Solstheim, has the ability to restore a mage's pool of magical energy, amongst other things. Taproot also seems to have the ability to modify magic, whether for positive or negative purpose. Often, growths like berries are able to found on Spriggans.

**Hagravens**

Hagravens, foul monstrosity of the Daedra Hircine, sacrifice Spriggans. To what purpose, it is unknown, but to a disgusting, evil one no doubt. Some speculate the a spriggan must be sacrificed in order to become one of the Princes servants, but this is unconfirmed. This seems to be the source of the enmity between them.

Amendment: It has come to my attention that a phenomenon exists known as *Burnt Spriggans*. I have been told that these oddities are infused with some manner of pyromancy, and can cast destructive spells. I was informed that I would be able to travel to Solstheim early this year. When I have the opportunity to do so, I will document these with strange abominations.

1350827751.0,48,self.teslore,11udev,Identifying the Ancient Nord Pantheon,ginja_ninja,55,7,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11udev/identifying_the_ancient_nord_pantheon/,"So I was playing my second Skyrim character exploring a place called High Gate Ruins. It's on the northwest shore of the landmass just east of the Solitude marsh and northeast of Morthal.

I progressed a fairly long way into the ruins before encountering a hallway and noticing its walls were adorned with carvings. A magelight orb on the ceiling shed some more light on them: 

http://imgur.com/a/11q0P

It's pretty clear that these are some of the undiluted, unimperialized Ancient Nord Gods, and I would like all of your opinions and input on just who exactly each of them is.

*Varieties of Faith* states Skyrim's traditional pantheon to be: **Alduin, Dibella, Orkey, Tsun, Mara, Stuhn, Kyne, Jhunal, Shor, Ysmir, Herma-Mora, Maloch.** We have a pretty good idea of who each of these dieties is, or at least have heard of them before.

Each of these carvings follows a template: the god is in the center in human form, surrounded by some type of object or animal related to their power with the caskets of 2 ancestors borne on either side and a top-dome section of some sort of godlike being or spirit animal.

The [first picture](http://i.imgur.com/DH18U.jpg) I think I can pretty conclusively posit is Shor. His attire looks very traditionally Nord, as do his spears. Nothing about the character in the image looks at all elven or even aedric. Except, of course, the bull's horns. The bull seems to have a strong love for and invested interest in the races of men. Finally, his top image is a great Sea Serpent. This is not the only instance of the Lorkhan-being having connections with the Serpent. I imagine the origin of this symbol came from either the original voyage over the Sea of Ghosts to Atmora or the Return. [Conjecture](/g ""The Atmorans, during their voyage, encountered a great serpent that rose out of the sea and did battle with it. Facing it down with the spears Shor himself had once taught them to fashion, they believed it was the spirit of mighty Shor himself come from the sea to challenge their mettle as warriors. And lo, upon its defeat the great beast began to rise out of the water, becoming engulfed in brilliant golden light that poured into the brave Atmoran vanquishers, and soon it was nothing more than a skeleton, rising into the sky. And the Atmorans at once heard a voice speak in their heads, that their victory that day had open the halls of Shor's domain Sovngarde to them. And the bones of the serpent came to rest across the great chasm and the spirits of worthy Atmorans would forever more be able to cross it into paradise with their lord."")

The [second picture](http://i.imgur.com/5cQ6o.jpg), however, I am much less conclusive about. This one looks decidedly more elvish, more aedric. The patterns on her clothing seem more elaborate, like they were made with cloth and dyes rather than hides like some of the others'. Also note the moths. This is what really puzzles me, I don't know which of the aedra, if any, is traditionally associated with the Ancestor Moth, which these pretty much have to be. Even though she is placed across from Shor's carving in the hallway, I'm reluctant to say this is Kyne. Kynareth is one of the Divines and acknowledged by the Empire as an aedra, but I'm thinking #5 would be a better fit for Kyne. Not sure about that one either though, we'll get back to it later. Anyway, if it's not Kyne, the only obvious choices in the known pantheon are Mara or Dibella. I know I've read a couple times in the really ancient lore folk stories that Mara was supposed to be a handmaiden of Kyne who would travel between different cultures and associate with all of them. This obviously fits her place in the Aldmeri pantheon as well. I don't know much about Dibella, so it would be great for anyone that could speak more on her to weigh in. The final component of her carving is the top section, which does not look like any sort of animal, but more of a godlike presence. To me, it looks Draconic. [Conjecture](/g ""It looks like the spiritual essence of a Dragon. It looks like Akatosh in aetherial form, pre-convention, channeling himself forward in time to guide man and mer through the tribulations of all the terrible and powerful things convention created from him and his derivatives."") Whether that tips the odds of it being more likely Kyne or more likely Mara is another matter of contention I assume as well, although my guess is still most likely Mara or none of the above.

The [third picture](http://i.imgur.com/4tgmf.jpg) I can feel a lot more confident in my guess though. This one has got to be Jhunal. The owls, stars, and crescents pretty much scream Julianos. His top picture (how about we just go ahead and call these totems) is very interesting; it's definitely another godlike aetherial being instead of an animal. This one, however, I can't even draw a connotation with a real-world creature like a dragon. It looks vaguely humanoid, although more merethic than human, has what appears to be a third eye on its forehead, and its elven-looking ears sprout out into owl wings. *VoF* mentions that Jhunal had a falling out with the other gods of the Nordic Pantheon, which is what led to him becoming Julianos in Cyrodiil and forgotten by Nordic religion. [Conjecture](/g ""Given that his and Mara's(?) 'totems' look markedly different than the other three, I would say their inexclusivity with the Nordic Pantheon fits them well."")

The [fourth picture](http://i.imgur.com/tmBC1.jpg) is another really interesting one that merits discussion. Its totem is a cat or beast. To me it looks very Khajiit-like, but that may or may not be of any consequence. What really jumps out at me about this image is how much it appears to have ""Forsworn"" written all over it. Dressed in hides, bearing two staves with saber cat skulls on them, and surrounded by ravens with a raven's skeleton above him. In Skyrim, there's some mention of the Forsworn worshipping the ""Old Gods,"" the gods from before the Divines came to be. Could this be one of them? Does he have no modern equivalent, his name forgotten to all but the Reachmen? The only possible guess I could hazard as to an identity could be Hircine due to the animals and Padomaic/Necromantic nature of the Forsworn, Hagravens, and their rituals. Hagravens are said to have an immense hatred of Kyne, and mutated themselves to profane her natural works. Could this god, Hircine or whoever else, have also had a falling out with the Proto-Nords? Or did he and his followers exist completely separate from the other gods? [Conjecture](/g ""My guess would be that this god did not join the Exodus to Atmora at the end of the Mythic Era, and rather stayed in Skyrim. Did the Nedic tribes inhabit the Reach in the Merethic? I thought the original conflict between the Nords and the Forsworn was based off the Nords stealing their land. Does anyone know if the Forsworn lived in the Reach before Ysgramor returned, or am I incorrect and the Falmer completely dominated all of Skyrim during the Merethic?"")

The [fifth picture](http://i.imgur.com/iATpp.jpg) I want to guess is Kyne. Her totem is an eagle and she is adorned everywhere with wings. Being the goddess of the air and goddess of nature, they seem appropriate. Let's also talk about the eagle though. We see eagles everywhere in Ancient Nord ruins. It goes without saying that the symbol of the Eagle was very powerful in Nord culture. You can see it everywhere on their ruins. I'm not sure whether it's tied to the Forsworn as well though. The word ""eagle"" is used in a lot of the names of Forsworn locations in the Highlands west of Whiterun. I'm not sure whether it's just borrowed from Ancient Nord Culture though. Kyne seems to be one of the two primary gods of the Nords, so it would make sense for her imagery to be widespread in their architecture. The Forsworn, or at least the Hagravens they worship, appear to be in staunch opposition to Kyne, to the point of capturing, torturing, and sacrificing spriggans. [Conjecture](/g ""This again points me to the conclusion that there are multiple layers of history in the mythology of Ancient Tamriel, and that not all of the beings who became Divines were truly 'original spirits.' There appears to be much more that happened, maybe entire civilizations or even worlds that existed before they did."")

So I did my best to interpret each of the images based on what I observed in them. I know a lot of you are extremely well-versed in pretty much every aspect of the lore so I'd love for everyone else to weigh in on it and point out their own observations and guesses.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Psijic,True,t3_11udev,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11udev/identifying_the_ancient_nord_pantheon/,

A narrative rather than a conjecture-and-theory hodge-podge. This, however, won't be written by an Imperial scholar. Just a story spawned from [these](http://redd.it/119xd8) theories*

When Time was not, there was a great many battles. The Ehlnofey were destroying each other, and the strongest among them knew that while they clashed, the Creation that some had fought so hard to escape, and that others had given so much to invent would be eventually lost.

Thus, the Aedra were born. Ascendant Ehlnofey from both sides, they rose to find a compromise, to end the Ehlnofex Wars. They could not do this as they were. They had to perfect themselves, shedding their less perfect parts, casting them away as they prepared to finally solidify Creation, Nirn.

The greatest among them, Auri-El, shed many parts. He loosed many creatures, and those he did not maintain were lost outside Creation. One, however, was more powerful than the other rejected pieces of the God-King. It fell from Creation, and, with one swift glance from beyond the Kalpa-Pool, saw the extremities and basins of all the previous Kalpas. He was so enlightened, that he had to make all this known. His power collected, he pulled himself back to Creation.

In the vastness of Oblivion, the King-Fragment, called Hermaeus Mora, Herma-Mora, and many other names, isolated for himself a plane all his own. This plane, as he called it, was Apocrypha. Containing the All-Knowledge and the Endless Library, Hermaeus Mora recorded all of the information he had gleaned from the previous Kalpas. His servant, Xarxes, went and endlessly, tirelessly sorted the books, filling the Endless Library and finding time yet to write his own manuscripts, one of which would fall to the mortal realm, the Mysterium Xarxes, but that is another story entirely.

But Mora was missing something. He knew there was something akin to him, something that was formed from the King-Fragments when Creation had just been born anew. He looked, scouring every edge of Oblivion and Mundus for tomes of infinite knowledge, tomes with knowledge more vast than even his own. He searched, but they eluded him. They were special, and no matter how hard he tried, his search was forever fruitless. He knew the contents of them, but he longed for more. He wanted to possess them, to complete his library and finally know all there was to know. But the Elder Scrolls, as they are known to the mortals, were beyond him, beyond all the Daedra, and could only be possessed by those they wished to possess them. So he took to his library, leaving rarely, and taking visitors only when he felt they were worthy.

And so, from Auri-El was shed Hermaeus Mora, from whom was created the Endless Library, and the realm of Apocrypha.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1350054234.0,,Julianos,True,t3_11cm4t,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11cm4t/the_birth_of_hermaeusmora/,

Greetings, and welcome to /r/teslore!

This is a guide to help you, the new scholar, find your place and fit in /r/teslore. 

/r/teslore is a subreddit where lore-freaks and talented scholars come together to share knowledge, discuss, and raise new ideas about Elder Scrolls lore. The subreddit is home to many extremely intelligent scholars, that can do everything from explain every tidbit of lore to decipher the mysterious writings of Micheal Kirkbride. All these great scholars had to have a start, though. Every experienced scholar and lore-buff was once just a person curious for answers. As with science, one cannot simply comprehend its vast reaches of knowledge, you have to start somewhere. By posting simple, yet well written posts, participating in thread discussions, and learning from good sources, one can achieve great knowledge in little time. Just follow these steps, and you will be respected and credited by the /r/teslore community.

**Learning Lore**

Before one can post and participate in /r/teslore, a new scholar has to get the basic knowledge of the lore. Note that it is impossible to simply summarize ES lore, as it is vast and contains far too many topics, but there are some sources that can get you started. The best way to start is by reading the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages’ Overview of history]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:History) can give you a good overview of historical events you will need to understand in order to participate in /r/teslore. After you have read through the history, the best way to start learning is by researching different things you care about in www.uesp.net and http://www.imperial-library.info/. Look up any article, and follow links from there. For example, if I were to be a new scholar interested in Argonian culture, I would look up Argonian information in UESP. From there, I would be interested in Black Marsh’s history, and would look that up. Then I would research the rest of the provinces, and then I would research Yokuda, Akavir, and Pyandonea. Suddenly I have a large amount of lore knowledge, just from being curious and looking up articles. It is *strongly* suggested that every new scholar should do this. Curiosity is what drives understanding. Once you think you have a good basic understanding of lore, it’s time to start getting involved in the subreddit.

**Posting**

So you think you know a good amount of basic lore, but now your questions are greater and cannot be simply answered by looking up a definition or an article. That is *perfect*. This is what gets a new scholar started. 

Questions aren’t always for threads, though. It is heavily stressed that one should always read the [**FAQ**](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/vs8w4/the_official_faq/) before posting. This applies to both new posters and old ones- as no scholar likes to answer the same question 20 times. The FAQ can be a great place for simple learning like the one suggested in *Learning Lore*. Read through the FAQ, get to know the popular questions, and read through and analyze the answers. 

So now you have a question, you know it’s not in the FAQ, and you really want to ask the community. Great, it’s time to post a thread.

Every thread should have a good, non-misleading title. Make sure to make it clear what you are posting about in your thread. Please refrain from posting threads with very general titles such as “I have a few questions” and “Just want some criticism on this theory”. Titles such as these can be easily fixed by adding the specific topic of your post in your titles (Ex. “I have a few questions about Alduin” or “Just want some criticism on this theory concerning Astrid’s control over the Dark Brotherhood”). 

In the post itself, a scholar should make it clear what his/her question/theory/etc. is about. 

If you are posting a question, it is suggested that you also make it clear what knowledge you do understand on the subject so that a commenting scholar can adjust his/her comment to make sense to you. If you do not, don’t be surprised if the answering scholar uses terms you do not understand. 

If you are posting a theory or an explanation of lore, make sure to support your claims with sources and be ready to argue for your theory. Good sources are the UESP website and the Imperial Library- but some other /r/teslore posts and lore forums links can be just as good. If a commenter asks you to make your writing clearer to them, or ask for any additional information, do your best to answer them clearly and provide any additional information needed. 

Once you have posted your thread, scholars will do their best to answer your questions and add to your theories. Do respond to your commenters- be it to argue with them or just simply thank them for their help. If a highly voted comment does not get a response from the OP (original poster), its commenter may feel as if their comment did not answer the OP’s question. Remember the rules established in the sidebar- upvote clear, explanatory, thoughtful comments and never downvote if you simply do not agree with the comment. If you do not agree with the comment, make a good comment arguing against it. Making a good argument and strongly debating it is much better and more honorable than simply throwing around downvotes.

So go ahead and post, reply to the comments, and post again. As long as you are curious and want to know more, never stop asking.

**Becoming a good scholar**

After you have started posting and commenting you are ready to start your existence as a scholar of ES lore. Now that you know how to handle yourself in the subreddit, start getting involved! Post in the community threads, give your opinions and answers to others’ questions, upvote and downvote, and most importantly remember to learn. If you ever go by the thought that you are ultimately knowledgeable and have no more to learn, you are not worthy of being called a scholar. A good scholar always seeks new frontiers. Imagine if humans in the renaissance age decided that they can never learn more- that their way of life is perfect and nothing should change. The same goes for understanding of lore. As long you are interested, keep learning.
It really all comes down to curiosity. Now that you know the basics you are ready to unleash that curiosity at the subreddit and start getting involved. Don’t be afraid, we all had a start. Remember:

Post, get involved, and keep on asking questions.

So get out there! You’ve got to start somewhere, after all.

This a pet theory of mine which tries to fix the leap between Towers holding up Mundus (Nu-Mantia intercept) and Talos holding up Mundus (Altmeri commentary on Talos).

------------------------------------------------------------------

Talos ascended as 3 when Hjalti Early-Beard, Zurin Arctus and Wulfharth of Atmora ascended when they mantled the Rebel-King-Observer Enantiomorph. To mantle something you must ""walk like them until they must walk like you."" and they did this by re-enacting Convention. Zurin Arctus as Magnus (Observer/Traitor) betrayed Wulfharth as Lorkhan (King), allowing Hjalti Early-Beard as Auri-El (rebel) to become King. This act of Convention was immortalised as the Zero Stone which became the Stone of Ada-Mantia. The creation of Ada-Mantia as well as the Creation of Red Tower (who's stone is the Heart of Lorkhan) allowed Mundus to survive without the need of the Gods.

&gt; What are the Towers?

&gt; They are magical and physical echoes of the Ur-Tower, Ada-mantia. Ada-mantia was the first spike of unassailable reality in the Dawn, otherwise called the Zero Stone. The powers at Ada-mantia were able to determine through this Stone the spread of creation and their parts in it.
The powers also created Red Tower and the First Stone. This allowed the Mundus to exist without the full presence of the divine. - NuMantia Intercept

The Aldmer who witnessed the creation of Ada-Mantia by Auri-El also subsequently saw Auri-El's ascension at Ada-Mantia in an attempt to teach his followers how to do the same.

&gt; He [Auri-El] then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane. - Varieties of Faith

The Aldmer subsequently attempted to do so. Different cults and groups took different attempts to do so. The Dwemer created Anumidium, the Altmer built Crystal-Like-Law, the Ayleids founded White Gold Tower and so on and so on. However as the power (and knowledge) of the Elves and Men dwindle (circa 3rd Era) we see a drop in their link to the Divine. No more Towers, no more Sunbirds and Mananauts......

The lowpoint of this trend is the Thalmor. The Altmer no longer have the knowledge of ascension that Auri-El taught them and so see no need in the Towers. The Towers are no longer gates to Aetherius from their material prison but Iron bars in their prison cell. The Thalmor therefore want to smash the bars of their prison cells. Orichalc and Red Tower have already fallen by the Oblivion Crisis and the Crisis itself takes down 3 more (Crystal-Like-Law, Green-Sap and White-Gold), conveniently unrepaired by the Thalmor. The 3 remaining ones; Snow-Throat, Adamantia and Khajiit (If they are a Tower) become their next targets. The Thalmor kill the Mane (the supposed Stone of the Khajiit) and they flood Skyrim with Justiciars looking to take down Snow-Throat. According to the the Book of the Dragonborn Snow Tower is down before Skyrim starts meaning that either a) Snow-Throat is still up or b) Something else is holding up Mundus. If (a) is correct then we must still think of the other potential Stones; Eye of Magnus (tried to be used by a Thalmor agent), Alduin (killed at the end of the MQ) and Paarthy (disappears after the events of MQ).

Therefore I believe (B) is the case. What holds up Mundus then? Talos.

&gt;To kill Man is to reach Heaven, from where we came before the Doom Drum's iniquity. When we accomplish this, we can escape the mockery and long shame of the Material Prison.

&gt;To achieve this goal, we must:

&gt;1) Erase the Upstart Talos from the mythic. His presence fortifies the Wheel of the Convention, and binds our souls to this plane.

As I previously stated Talos mantled Convention, making him Convention 2.0. Convention itself is the Stone of Ada-Mantia, so Convention 2.0 is also a Stone; the Stone of Talos. Hence, ""Talos fortifies the Wheel of Convention"" by doubling it and also acts like a Tower thus satisfying both Nu-Hatta and the Thalmor.

1346020538.0,45,self.teslore,yvfmz,Ayleid Culture,regalnerd,52,7,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/yvfmz/ayleid_culture/,"*I felt like celebrating by last day of freedom before classes started up, and what better way of doing that than spend time with my dear friends on /r/teslore. I hope you enjoy!*

So, the Ayleids are my favorite race and my personal area of expertise, and sadly they are rather over looked in lore even though in my opinion they are as interesting as the Dwemer. I decided to amend this disturbing lack of Ayleids by writing a guide to them.

**Culture**

Sadly there isn't a lot we know for sure about the culture of the Ayleid thanks to the Marukh and his order, but we can extrapolate quite a bit from in game texts. You'll often hear that the Ayleid were Daedra worshipers, this is partially incorrect, they were not Daedra worshipers in the sense that the Velothi were Daedra worshipers, they likely had some Daedra in their pantheon, [Shezarr and the Divines](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/shezarr-and-divines) gives the Impression that the Ayleid pantheon was very similar to Aldmeri pantheon, however we know for a fact that the Ayleid people worshiped Meridia, they viewed her as the embodiment of their most sacred element, light. One of their ruins also bears the name of Dagon, [Atatar](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Atatar), Atatar Haelia Dagon, which means Fatherwood Terrible Dagon, and according to [Tretise on Ayleidic Cities](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Treatise_on_Ayleidic_Cities) states that they built Varsa Baalim to deter people from the razor. So I would rule out Dagon as a member of the Ayleidoon pantheon.

If I were to make an educated guess then I would say that the Ayleid pantheon consisted of Auriel, Magnus, Mara, Stendar, Xen, Meridia, Vaermina, and Azura.

Auriel is presumed because the Ayleid had built one of the Towers, and the Towers are typically indicative of Auriel worship, and that Akatosh greatly resembles the more benign Auriel than his Nordic aspect. Magnus has a shrine in [Ceyatatar](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/glories-and-laments). Mara is a universal god that appears in both the Nordic and Aldmeri pantheons, as well as Stendar and Xen. Meridia represented Light in the Ayleid religion, and had a deal with their king, so I would presume her worship was very important. I just put Vaermina in there because her sphere is related to torture, and the Ayleidoon slave masters really seemed to enjoy torture. Feel free to swap her out for any other god you see fit. Azura fits in to the theme of light in the Ayleid religion since she is the goddess of dusk and dawn.

You'll also note a pervasive theme in Ayleid culture, Birds. Birds are represented in the armor, in wepons, in crowns, in names. I believe this is because of interbreeding between Aldmeri settlers the native bird folk of Cyrodiil as described in [Father of the Niben](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/father-niben). It would explain why there is only one copy of Torpals expedition, as interracial breeding was seen as abhorrent in the eyes of the Ald/tmer, and anybody who was convicted of this was sent into exile on the mainland (Source: [Pocket Guide to the Empire, First Edition](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-aldmeri-dominion))

There is a vast difference between the Pre Alessian Ayleid and the Post Alessian Ayleid. The Pre Alessian Ayleids seemed to be outgoing in a sense, they wrote in the Dwemeri alphabet, so it can be assumed that they had a good relation with the Dwemer, and the Falmer language is Ayleidoon written in a different alphabet, so it can also be assumed that they were on good terms with the Falmer, and when the Alessians forced the remaining Ayleid people out of Cyrodiil their first thought was to go to Valenwood, which would seem to put them on good terms with the Bosmer. Compare this with the highly isolationist Post Alessian Tribes described in the book [The Wild Elves](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/daggerfall-wild-elves) and it is a rather shocking turn around. They even changed their language, In Pre Alessian Ayleidoon Pelinal meant ""Star Made Knight"" in Post Alessian Ayleidoon Pelani means ""Outsider.""

It is written in an in-world way, so treat it with the same amount of salt as you would any other in-world text. Finally, there are **untagged spoilers** for *Morrowind*. With these points in mind, please enjoy my first proper contribution here.]

Some will tell you that the Tribunal are false gods, mer who stole their power from an ancient artifact and set up a reign of lies for their own aggrandisement.

Some will tell you the Tribunal are good and just, the natural successors to the Good Daedra, who are their Anticipations.

Listen, and I will speak of a third way, but first there are things you must know. Men and mer alike have no doubt that what is done today can change what happens tomorrow, but few know that what happens tomorrow can change yesterday. Many speak different views on the same matter, each convinced that their position is the truth. Here is the secret: they are all right.

It is known that the Tribunes were mer, but they became so much more than that. It is known, too, that the Heart was a key to their ascension, but as great as the Heart's power was, it was not the sole reason for their godhood. Just as a skilled archer can shoot an arrow with greater force and accuracy than even a strong man could throw it, the Heart propelled the Tribunes towards the mantling of their Anticipations, and we shall speak of each of them in turn.

Vivec was the greatest success. Some who know secrets condemn him for the murder of the Hortator, who was his lover; to those I must ask what act could be more in the spirit of the Black Hands Mephala, whose domain is sex and death? But for Vivec, the mantling of Mephala was not enough, for he learned of a state higher than this, beyond all words and blades. This is spoken of with the divine word CHIM, and in his grace Vivec wrote three dozen lessons through which those with understanding could follow his burning path.

Almalexia is the greatest tragedy of the Tribunes. While she took on the nature of the Dunmer's god-ancestor, the mind of the Prince of Plots is no small thing to manage, and with the heart denied to the Tribunal by the Sharmat, Almalexia's hold began to unravel. She saw plans in shadows and conspiracies in random chance; not content with seeing these threads everywhere, she bound herself up in her own webs, an afflicted spider only crippling her own limbs.

Sotha Sil is the greatest mystery. His Anticipation was Azura, and it is known that he withdrew from the affairs of Morrowind into his own Clockwork City, of which none now living know where it stood. Some say he gave wisdom to the Psijiics, and his focus was the divine act of creation. The secret is that his embodiment of Azura -- though some will say he had partial influence on that Twilight at best -- was the thread tying together the strange days of the Nerevarine, and ultimately causing great calamity.

Who, then, is the villain of this piece? Azura. False to the Tribunes, false to the Dunmer, Prince of nothing but her own bitterness, let your name be never spoken again but as a curse. AYEM AE SEHTI AE VEHK.

The ending of the words is ALMSIVI.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Armigers,True,t3_14uixx,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14uixx/an_alternate_view_of_the_tribunal/,

Now, before I begin, I think that thinkpadius' post was absolutely brilliant. It was/is a well written, well crafted theory. My only issue is that there is a much simpler reason for the observed decline of weapon variety and technology that can be observed in the gameplay.

I believe that the reason for this is simple- region.

Morrowind, as we all are aware, is a rather exotic place, filled with varying flora and fauna, a veritable cacophony of ideologies, landscapes, and what have you. It is a very diverse land, and that is reflected in its weaponry as well. In Morrowind, you have spears, halberds, shuriken, axes, katana, three categories of armour types; the list goes on.

Skyrim, in contrast, is a relatively bleak place. It is harsh and inhospitable, and its people are rough and hardy. Their land is not flamboyant and host to a multitude of different climate zones. In fact, there are really only three- temperate, subarctic, and arctic. In this case, the land and people are reflected in their weaponry yet again. All that exist in Skyrim are bows, swords, axes, maces, daggers, and hammers. Simple but effective is their philosophy, shaped from their landscape, embedded in their psyche, and thus reflected in their craft.

Cyrrodiil is somewhat of a ""happy medium"" between Morrowind and Skyrim. It is a melting pot of cultures and schools of thought, it is quite literally the crux of Tamriel, however it holds more of a ""traditional"" mindset and philosophy to it. These factors allow the weapons of Cyrodiil to have a controlled variety reflected upon them, if you will- there is a variety, but not an unnecessary quantity of options.

The issue that many people have with this is that the observer can never actually observe all three places at once in the same time period. Which, in turn, gives off the illusion that certain technologies are regressing, and could possibly (albeit falsely, in my opinion) reflect a possible dark age.

Thank you for reading, I look forward to hearing your responses!

###A Pocket Guide to the Ages
    
*Part I*

___
Greetings, traveler. I'm fairly confident in positing that, as you've exhibited the ingenuity to discover this document, you too are one unfettered by such trivial things as the grasp of Aka or the cage of convention. So, presented in these pages is a simple guide through the ages; so you may explore with foreknowledge of what to expect and how to dress accordingly.

All that lay before the annals of time started with a whisper. No, that's not correct, not a whisper; but the thought of a whisper. No, that's not right either. The preconceived concept that thinking of a whisper may be an option. And with the idea of the possibility of a word uttered under still breath; Anu and Padomay came along. No more siblings than they were enemies; more verbs than nouns; both all and nothing; one pushing and one pulling before such actions were even tangible. And forth from the two undefinable, the rest fell into place. First, as the void persisted, conflict between the primordial forces went on unknown and unrecorded.  All events happened simultaneously and not at all.

Anu and Padomay looked upon what was transpiring between each other and with that, looked back upon their own antithesis. Anu was moved by his own reflection, thus in breaking his immobility, Anui-El came to be. Padomay, struck silent by the shock of introspection, paused a moment; and thus Sithis was also born. With both these children, each side of the coin was complete. With order and adaptation in place; Aurbis, the canvas for creation, was set.

From this state, a single stream began to emerge within itself and that of Anu. Thus, Aka was created. For, henceforth in his presence, the void would no longer be simultaneous and rhyme-less, but instead time would reign as law. But, as you may be already aware, laws can be bent and sometimes; broken.

With the passing of these generations of Anu also came the progeny of the whirling chaos. From Sithis came another to bear many names; Lorkhan, of whom would remain unnoticed until his own great contribution would be laid forthright.

It is highly recommended to all travelers of whom would like to witness events of the Dawn Era; consider all complications involved in a vacation spanning before times advent. Remember, all events prior to Aka, time itself, are nebulous and untethered, order and age indeterminable. More like the dream of a restless mind than the passing of events. After such considerations have been made, cancel your plans and instead use your powers of space/time to visit Elsweyr to indulge in a bit of Skooma. While this too may be inadvisable, it will still yield better results than your previous itinerary.

With the architecture for existence laid, so too did trickle down the lines of realization many children, simply ideas within themselves, these thoughts garnering their own spirit. Born to one of two houses, the children of Padomay and Anu came to play and to build. And build they did. The Aurbis henceforth, still young and unsculpted, would never be the same.

1352757797.0,46,self.teslore,1333h6,"Where does the Magicka that a wizard uses come from, and how does it allow him to cast the wide variety of spells found in the Elder Scrolls games?",,55,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1333h6/where_does_the_magicka_that_a_wizard_uses_come/,"I've played Elder Scrolls for a while now, but I'm still confused as to how magic functions at its most basic level in the Elder Scrolls. I'm aware that a wizard's ability to cast spells is linked to Magicka, but how does that work?

I understand that magicka has something to do with Magus fleeing Nirn, but how did that allow men and mer to cast spells? Or are the two unrelated?

Further, how do the actual mechanics of magic work in Elder Scrolls? When a wizard summons a gout of flame or turns himself invisible, how does magicka allow him to do that? And how is it that magicka can allow these things to happen, while also allowing the wizard to raise the corpses of the dead or summon Daedra from Oblivion?

I'm sorry if this is a lot, but this is something that has confused me about Elder Scrolls for a while now.

1351055241.0,45,self.teslore,11zpv9,The time god's whiskers and other Khajiiti myths explored.,Voryn,50,5,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11zpv9/the_time_gods_whiskers_and_other_khajiiti_myths/,"Ever since my return from seclusion, I have found myself overwhelmed by news of things Id all but shut my eyes and ears to.  So entrapped in my own designs and philosophies that the world's vastness had escaped me, much more so its far larger culture. As I rediscovered the world and my own place in it, I found myself more often than not on the trail of a new library or some other repository of knowledge. While my own knowledge of the higher workings of our world is not insubstantial, many are the things I had not given thought during my time in seclusion. And so, many are the topics that have surprised me, especially since at the time, I thought that very few had the knowledge and wisdom required to see through the webs of misunderstanding and lies wrapped around the world. I would like to apologise, for I was wrong. Topics ranging from the tower, the wheel, aetherius and various others from all tiers of existence. So, in continuation with Nirn's growing enlightenment, I shall humbly submit my thoughts surrounding the yet mysterious aspect of the time god, Alkosh, as well as the khajiit's place in the world (along with that of the bosmer). Some information regarding towers and stones shall be briefly presented, however it is all still speculation.




Who is Alkosh? Where is his place amongst the other pantheons? Much is obscured, much is unknown. I believe, however, that the answers are not as simple (I use that term loosely, mind you) as the other pantheons would put it. Following the khajiiti creation myth, Alkosh is a product of the union of both Anu and Padomay (known to the khajiit as Ahnurr and Fadomay), as is every other god (or at least those mentionned in the myth). Now where does that lead us? Both Anuic and Padomaic? 
Lets look at Elsweyr:
We have a province that is half desert, half jungle. The nomads and the sedentaries, the poor and the rich. They have fought for time beyond our knowing. One accuses the other of decadence, then he in turn accuses the first of being savage. Does this sort of relationship not strike a familiarity? 

Following the fact that the Khajiiti creation myth continues on the elven road of portraying Lorkhan as a trickster (even if his birth and location of would see him somewhat sympathetically), I would describe Alkosh as his first incarnation, both Anuic and Padomaic before his affection by the Marukhati selectives ploy. For indeed Alkosh was affected by their dance, as the khajiit say themselves. Undeniably one will look at the story of their creation myth and think that their gods are more Padomaic in nature. Perhaps it was true once, then not, but today it seems that it is true. For some. The marukhati sought to remove anuic aspects, thus elven, of akatosh, and so they did. To the khajiit, Alkosh, akatosh, at the time undivided, became sundered of its elven aspects. Then a new deity appears: The Riddle'thar.
--It should be noted that the Khajiit view the padomaic more in the fashion that others see the anuic, therefore certain things must be regarded cautiously--


The Riddle'thar seems to have taken over a great part of the worship once attributed to Alkosh. He was introduced by one of the manes : Rid-Thar-ri'Datta. He seems to act as Anuic gods generally do. To quote ""some of his avatars like to appear as humble messengers of the gods."" Were I to deduce certain facts from general knowledge, I would surmise that the Riddle'thar is mainly worshipped in the south, the jungles, while Alkosh, as it is said ""he still enjoys immense popularity in Elsweyr's wasteland regions"" is mostly venerated in the north, the desert. I assume this since the Riddle'thar seems now more popular than Alkosh, and would assume most of the population of elsweyr lies in the south seeing as it is the richer part and more travelled path (for, indeed, the south possesses most if not all of the port cities). The riddle'thar may very well be the sundered aspect of Alkosh under a new name.



Now, the Khajiit, who are they, where do they come? The origins of the Khajiit are shrouded in mystery, they exist since beyond written time. I shant tackle the means by which they came to be, how long have they truly been on Nirn, for it has far less information of note than their creation myth. What we do know: They were of the same kin as the wood elves, who are no true mer. Both have been changed from their original unknown forms. I do not doubt Azura was responsible for their present form, her abilities to so drastically influence a people is evident enough on my own ashen skin. Her capacity to tie the Khajiit's physiology to the moons however, leads me to believe she may be tied in some way to Lorkhan. The same thought I have had for Y'ffre, who turned the bosmer into their current forms, elves, interesting choice. It is worth noting that the ""human"" aspects of Khajiit are in fact elven, as their children can almost be mistaken for young elves if not for their tails.
Were I to speculate wildly, I would say the Khajiit may have at one time been related to elves, but have since been tied by Azura to Lorkhanic elements. (side-thought: It is said the khajiit are the only people capable of putting the moons back into proper aligment, and that this aligment protects Nirn from the wrath of Ahnurr, what might that be...)



Now on to the elements pertaining to the tower and their stone. First and foremost, while I do believe certain towers were created by the elves, most, like adamantine, snow throat, red mountain and so on are older than mer. Now, it has been speculated that the stone of the Khajiiti is the Mane, their spiritual leader. As all stones have to do with Lorkhan, and certain sources point to the Mane being the third moon, I am strongly inclined to believe this to be true. Now what about the tower? The Khajiit of course, their very kin, but only when united. Why else would the Thalmor seek to deceive them for their alligeance and then split them once again into Anequina and Pelletine? If they had simply tried exterminating the Khajiit, they might have all banded together in defence of their homeland, and then all hope of terminating their tower would be gone, for exterminating a race as clever in desperation as the Khajiit in its entirety is not likely. 



On the thalmor it is to be said, they are liars in purpose and in action. They proclaim themselves ""saviors of mer"" when they have only allied with two races that were never ""true"" mer, and utterly ignored their brethren, orsimer and dunmer. If there is a reason behind this I shall pursue it until it unveils its secrets before me. Until then I shall endeavor to go through bosmeri lore surrounding Y'ffre. So far I am lead to believe he may be an aspect of Lorkhan, as a prophet mentions his return it seems to match the idea that Lorkhan is secretly working to move the gears beneath the world to engineer some sort of event, be it his return or otherwise. If such a thing reveals true, then my belief that the forests of Valenwood are the stone of Falinesti may reveal plausible. The great migrating tree did only root after the oblivion crisis, when trees once protected by the wood elves were inevitably damaged by the ongoing daedra onslaught.



I would speak more of my thoughts but the riddles and possible truths are infinite and sleep has eluded my troubled mind for long and it seems to now finally call. I must admit my weariness grew as I wrote and I apologise if the quality of the work lessened. I encourage any that wish to give thoughts on my work to do so, I could well use the points of view of others.
May night and dream bring you all counsel.

1336636635.0,44,self.teslore,tg6fv,Vehk the Mortal,Prince-of-Plots,48,4,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/tg6fv/vehk_the_mortal/,"Let's take a look at [What My Beloved Taught Me](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1370866-foul-murder/page__st__60__p__20712279#entry20712279), a recently posted text by MK involving Nerevar's first meeting with the young Vehk on the streets of Mournhold. It's not particularly cryptic, but it's a text I really love so I'm gonna break it down anyway. Let's begin:

First, understand the format. The questions, in bold, are posed by Nerevar. The answers are given by Vehk. It's quite an unnatural conversation, so I get the feeling that this may not be a true account of events and instead another one of Vivec's writings. What do you guys think?

&gt;***Who are you?***

&gt;*A gutter-get, a daggerlad, a netchiman’s son. I have my own gang. Get away from me or they’ll stare.*

Vehk is a common thug, it appears. You'll note that in the sermons, he was born of a netchiman's wife, so perhaps that tidbit of Vehk's history wasn't made up.

&gt;***Who are we?***

&gt;*‘We’..? You mean ‘you’. You, sera, wear the namesake of a tramp’s house and your sandals are dusty. I’d guess you the guard of some canvasari, if I had to, and your lordship if you paid. Come now. A six-bitten dram and I’ll touch. A scrib-roll and we’ll have candles. Closer and in your ear: I was born a whelp-wench in my under, if that suits you.*

When asked who they are, Vehk quickly points out that they aren't the same kind of person. I think I've read somewhere that Almalexia was, in fact, the head of House Indoril before she was divine, but maybe not. If so, she is no doubt the tramp Vehk is talking about, because Indoril is the house - Nerevar went by the name Indoril Nerevar. Vehk guesses that he'd be the guard of a caravan (or canvasari in Chimeri), and that's how Nerevar is portrayed in the sermons before he became Hortator.

Vehk then changes the subject - it turns out, he's only interested in making a quick buck. He attempts to prostitute himself off to Nerevar, saying that for a ""six-bitten dram"" he'll touch (no explanation needed there, hopefully) and for a scrib-roll, he'll make it a little more intimate. If I understand right, he then makes it known to Nerevar that he is a hermaphrodite and has both female and male genitalia.

This is interesting, because it suggests Vehk was hermaphroditic before his divinity. Perhaps that was so.

&gt;***What makes us great?***

&gt;*For true, you ask me this? I see only a sandal-foot sword in love with Mephala's teachings, and Veloth's. Won’t you love me, too? Or does his lordship want it Saliache, weeping and weak-kneed with their lisp, their lilt, as I can do that, too.*

Vehk immediately rejects the suggestion that Nerevar is great. To him, Nerevar is simply a soldier who places to much emphasis on religion (to a thug like Vehk, I'd imagine any average Chimer does this). Again, he goes back to trying to sell himself. I don't know what ""Saliache"" is, but with the following context, I think I can guess.

&gt;***Where do we live?***

&gt;*Eh? This is the Mourning Hold, you may keep what inn you need. As for me, I call these alleys home, or the under-docks, and mark my only-known days with sores. You tilt your head in a way that I do not like.*

They're in Mournhold, and Vehk explains he has no home. He implies that of the days he can remember, he marks them with sores (battle or sex?). I think that then, he takes offense to the way Nerevar appears to judge him.


&gt;***How do we live?***

&gt;*You? You seem to live no life that I can match, and seem to do it from behind a mask. Drinksweat tubes beneath, if I’m no mistake. Fair, then: you have riches and a good master. So pay now or move on. I live by gutting those that would estimate me as some other worth; higher, lower, base, or dumb beast.*

Vehk again separates himself from Nerevar, emphasizing the difference of their lifestyles. Nerevar, being a soldier, always wears a mask and lives his life behind it (more than literally). Vehk lives a rough lifestyle in a dog-eat-dog world. Again he sees that Nerevar is wealthier than he, and is becoming impatient that he's not buying anything.

&gt;***What is important in my life?***

&gt;*That’s for yourself to esteem. By now, and little offense, but you’ve set me bored. Have you brought a skoomerpipe with you, or flin? I’d show you a roof where we could look on this poor country of ash-woven outcasts and share sigils. Share spears.*

All this deep talk has bored Vehk, and he doesn't even answer the question. He asks Nerevar if he has any alcohol or drugs, so Vehk is obviously pretty accustomed to that sort of thing. He invites him to a secluded spot to ""share spears"".

&gt;***Who rules us?***

&gt;*That [censored]-[censored] of a storm that runs The Orphanage, if the writs be read. And I’ve yet to learn that bit of tradecraft. I see now only in the sigils, and yours are recognizable enough. Would you let me wear that mask, if only for a minute?*

I'm assuming ""The Orphanage"" is some kind of brothel that Vehk belongs to. I don't know what Vehk means by ""sigils"" - coins, perhaps?

He asks Nerevar if he can wear his mask, ""if only for a minute"". I think this shows that Vehk wants out of his lifestyle, and into something like Nerevar's. This whole text gives me the impression that Vehk is a thug and prostitute, but he wants to become something bigger, which is interesting, because he does - when he eventually penetrates Nerevar with Muatra. Metaphors everywhere.

&gt;***What makes a Chimer great?***

&gt;*Making sure the other dies before you.*

Again representative of his lifestyle. Also of Boethiah, which is interesting for one such as Vehk who cares little for religion.

&gt;***What is the difference between men and women?***

&gt;*There is no difference in me, milord. Come: rooftop. Bring your money.*

Vehk hints again at his hermaphroditism. He's very impatient now, we see.

&gt;***What is evil?***

&gt;*Teasing.*

Very impatient.

&gt;***What is my lot in life?***

&gt;*A sixth-dram dropped, and you flinch from my hand. Good, muthsera. Good for you. I have the third’s eye fire and can tell you the story of your house. In the all honest Vel, I’d rather have that than your hand. It has the ghartoki on it. Hold now, they both do. Who are you, sandal man?*

If I'm right, a sixth-dram is currency. Nerevar flinches when Vehk drops one. I don't know what ""third's eye fire"" is (help, anyone?), but I think Vehk has noticed that Nerevar isn't the type to purchase sex. Instead, he tries to sell him the story of his house. Vehk then notices Nerevar has the ""ghartoki"" on his hands, and becomes quite serious.

If you know your sermons, this'll be familiar. In the sermons, Vivec's egg had written ""GHARTOK PADHOME GHARTOK PADHOME"". GHARTOK, in Ehlnofex, means ""hand/s"", and PADHOME means Padomay. Therefore, Nerevar had ""Hands of Padomay"" or something similar written on his hands.

I don't know what ghartoki is in this context, but nevertheless, Nerevar has them on his hands. Thoughts on this?


&gt;***How do we deal with others?***

&gt;*For you, I would shave this head. It would not do that your new friend shook an inconstant kwam-lice from it. I'd take the sigil of Vel, the V, and wear it twice. And I would be new, and believe in the one moon and star as your banner does. I’d make a legend of this netch longhook. Make no frown that this will be my weapon in your guard, however low its station. We all drink from the milk of our fathers. I’d learn to read and then write so that I could see right your name forever. And I would clean your feet so that the next time you made treaty it would be with an assured step.*

This whole thing seems poetic and post-mortal in nature, contributing to my thought that this isn't what actually happened.

Vehk says he would shave his head to deal with Nerevar (whatever that means), which is interesting, because in [this picture](http://img195.imageshack.us/img195/7236/foulmurder.jpg) he's sporting a nice mohawk, but later he is bald. Thoughts?

He also says he would take the sigil of Vel[oth], the V. Chimer write in Daedric, so that would be said ""Vehk"". So, he takes that name. He says he will wear it twice, and he did - once as Vehk the Mortal, once as Vehk the God. Vehk and Vehk. V'Vehk. Vivec. Still blows my mind.

So again, looks like this was written post-mortality. As for the rest of this, I can't really say anything for sure. Vehk says he would be in Nerevar's service, ""believ[ing] in the one moon and star as [his] banner does"", and being ""in [his] guard"". Could his netch longhook be Muatra? Drinking his father's milk is very interesting, given Vehk's history of using the term ""milk-finger"".

&gt;***Who are our enemies?***

&gt;*He that says your name wrong, in sky beard, or fourth corner, or the mock-walkers of our cousins, the tunnelers. This, too: the [censored]-[censored] of storm if she does not take your hand when you ask it. And I see this idea behind that mask of yours already. You aim to take the land anew. You aim to wake the old sleeper. You aim to make the sky red. You have a name for it already.*

The first part refers to non-Chimer (he talks about Nords and Dwemer), so outlander hate started pretty early, it seems. He also refers to the head of The Orphanage, again.

Vehk then sees Nerevar for him, and not for his mask. He sees his potential and his ideals. ""Take the land anew"" means to form an alliance with Dumac and restore peace in Resdayn. ""Wake the old sleeper"" means to combat the Sharmat as Hortator. But, ""make the sky red""? That sounds a lot like the Blight - Dagoth's business. What does he mean here?

&gt;***Who are our gods?***

&gt;*Old things. Leftovers. We left them all behind with the weepers. Their names now are only numbers. I’ll become good with those, my Grace. Trust me. The ending of the words is HORTATOR.*

I have no idea about this part. Are the weepers the Altmer? Are their gods the ones he's talking about? I do know that the last line gave me *chills*.

1375451856.0,43,self.teslore,1jkb22,"On The Species Of Tamriel, volume V: Ashskinned and Ill-Favoured",Hollymarkie,59,16,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1jkb22/on_the_species_of_tamriel_volume_v_ashskinned_and/,"*Welcome back to the fifth volume of 'On the Species of Tamriel'! This volume will deal with the Dunmer of Morrowind. These Elves, with their strange appearance and culture are truly an interesting subject of study. Without further ado: here is 'Ashskinned and Ill-favoured'.*


The Dunmer ( 'Dark', 'gloomy' or 'ill-fated people'), or Dark Elves in the human provinces (In both cases, Dark may refer to more than just 'dark-skinned', as the other translations seem to fit Dunmeri culture and history well), are the ash-skinned elves of the eastern province of Morrowind. These elves are noted for their unnerving appearance, and their long history of violence, and, in the past, for their strange religion.
	
As all elves, the Dunmer have pointed ears, a respected longevity, a slender and agile build, and a strong affinity to magic. Unlike most other elves, they focus on the use of the destruction school of magic, which fits their culture and society well. Possibly because of this focus, they have developed noteworthy resistance to fire. They also have the ability to call upon their ancestors protection, in the form of a magical shield or a spirit that helps during combat. This is a result of their ancestor worship.  
Alongside the standard elven traits, they differ in their red eye colour, and their bluish-gray skin tone, which is often seen as eerie by men who see a Dark Elf for the first time. Their physical appearance is part of a curse, laid upon them by the Daedric prince Azura.

The Dunmer find their origin in the Chimer (Changed Ones) and, ultimately, the Aldmer. As mentioned in the volume on the Aldmer, the Aldmeri culture eventually disbanded. One of the groups that split and went to settle modern day Morrowind, were the Chimer, led by Saint Veloth. One of the main reasons of the split lay in the Daedra worship, advocated by the Chimer, which was met by dismay of the Aldmer. When the Chimer landed in Morrowind, they found their distant cousins the Dwemer (Deep Ones, referring to their underground cities) had already settled the land. The next few millennia were filled with conflict with the Dwemer and the Nords of Skyrim. Eventually, during the first era, the Dunmer, led by the legendary hero-king Indoril Nerevar (later Saint Nerevar), and the Dwemer, led by Dumac dwarf-king, decided to unite, both to bring peace to their people, and to drive the Nords from the newly declared land of Resdayn. This unity is known as the First Council, and brought prosperity to both people. However, after some time past, the Chimer started the war of the First Council, after Voryn Dagoth, high councillor of House Dagoth, learned that the Dwemer were feeding of the Heart of Lorkhan, an artefact of the Et'Ada punished by the Aedra, to power a weapon to destroy the Chimer. At the height of the war, now general Indoril Nerevar, and trusted friend Voryn Dagoth, stormed the Red Mountain, where the Heart was, and fought themselves into the Heart chamber. There, Chief Tonal Architect Kagrenac used his tools on the heart. What exactly happened, and if it was on purpose, is unknown, yet all Dwemer, both in Resdayn and in the rest of Tamriel, disappeared without a trace.  
Just after the disappearance, Dagoth urged the destruction of the Heart and the tools, so that no one could temper with such power. Nerevar, wanting to council his advisors first, trusted Dagoth with protecting the tools. According to the Tribunal, after he counselled his advisors, the later Tribunal of Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec, and the Daedra Azura, he returned with the Tribunal to Red Mountain, to tell Dagoth that the tools were to be kept safe, but never used. Dagoth, however, now calling himself Dagoth Ur, refused to give them back, as he had been experimenting with the tools and the Heart, and had been corrupted by it. A battle ensued, which saw the supposed death of Dagoth Ur and the mortally wounding of Indoril Nerevar.  
The Ashlanders hold a different tradition. According to them Nerevar was murdered by the Tribunal, who faked summoning Azura. After the murder, Azura appeared to curse the Chimer, changing them into the Dunmer they are now. The Tribunal went up and in Red Mountain to kill Dagoth Ur. The Tribunal, now alone with the Heart and the tools, used them to get their immortality, and instituted themselves as the new gods of the Dunmer. After some years of studying their newly found powers, the Tribunal found the way to regain their original, Chimeri appearance, with Almalexia appearing completely Chimer, Vivec having one side golden golden, one side Blueish-black, and Sotha Sil rumoured to be completely Dunmeri, as he doesn't care much for his appearance.

Culturally, the Dunmer are noted for their violent culture. Most Dark Elves are gifted fighters and destruction mages, and Morrowind was the only province under the Empire were a assassin's guild was legal, the Morag Tong. When a Morag Tong assassin kills someone as part of his contract and is caught, he only has to show his writ of execution to be left alone. Furthermore, the Dunmer show a hatred towards outsiders, and often calling them names.

Originally, the Dunmer worshipped three 'good' Daedra, Azura, Mephala, and Boethiah, and despised four others, known as the 'four corners of The House of Trouble', Sheogorath, Mehrunes Dagon, Malcath, and Molag Bal. After the war of the First Council, this was changed to the Tribunal worship, where, instead of the three good Daedra, the Dunmer worshipped their living gods, Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil. This also saw the institution of a Saint system, where old hero's as Veloth and Nerevar were worshipped. They kept the House of Troubles, though. The Tribunal has never been accepted by the Ashlander Tribes of Vvardenfell, who retained the original Daedra and ancestor worship. After the death of the Tribunal at the hands of the Nerevarine, the reincarnation of Indoril Nerevar, the Dunmer went back to their original Daedra worship.

The politics of the Dunmer are significantly different from the rest of Tamriel. Since the Dunmer were never really conquered by the Empire, instead having a treaty which allows them to retain their own laws and structures (which also makes the existence of the Morag Tong possible, along with the slave trade), politics in Morrowind are divided in five Great Houses, which share resemblance to a clan structure. The Houses are Hlaalu, Redoran, Dres, Telvanni and Indoril.  
House Hlaalu is a House of opportunists. While they held the best contacts with the Empire and were noted for their openness (having the most a non-Dunmer councillor), they are also partially in charge of the Morag Tong, which is strongly anti-Empire. Most Hlaalu members get their fortune from trading.  
House Redoran is more traditionally. They didn't despise the Empire, but weren't ready to serve it either. Redoran members are noted for being extremely honourable, and some of the best soldiers and fighters of Morrowind.  
If Redoran is traditional, than House Dres is extremely conservative. Dres has always resented the Empire, and accepting the Tribunal is most likely their most progressive move they've ever made. Dres is also the house of the slavers, since their territory is near the border with Argonia (Argonians being popular slaves).  
House Telvanni is a very xenophobic house, even for Dark Elven standards. They have always resented the Empire, along with all other Houses and Institutions. The Telvanni have almost no history of working together. Instead, the mages of Telvanni are known to be very individual, almost always concerning themselves just with their own research and progress.  
The last House, Indoril, is the most religious one, and possibly the most important, house of Morrowind. Since their capital, Mournhold, was both the seat of power of the king of Morrowind and Almalexia of the Tribunal, the Indoril have always been strongly present all around Morrowind. Since Almelexia took a liking towards the Indoril, they have been gaurds of the Temples throughout Morowind. After the death of the Tribunal, the Indoril have been somewhat disoriented.  

After the Battle of Red Mountain, which concluded the War of the First Council, there have been some historically interesting things to note.  
There had been multiple skirmishes with both the Alessian Empire (the last year of which is detailed in the book series '2920') and the Septim Empire. Morrowind was the only province not conquered, as the Tribunal struck a deal with the Empire: they were allowed to keep their laws and customs. In turn, Morrowind would pay taxes to the empire, and Tiber Septim got control of Numidium, a Dwemer war machine found under Red Mountain. Tiber Septim would later use it to take the other provinces.  
At the end of the third era, the Nerevarine surfaced on Vvardenfell. After being proclaimed Hortator by the Houses Telvanni, Hlaalu, and Redoran. and Nerevarine by the Ashlander Tribes, he climbed the Red Mountain and destroyed both Dagoth Ur ( being kept on Nirn by the Heart of Lorkhan) and the Heart itself, destroying the immortality of the Tribunal. This led to the end of the Tribunal religion, and the Dark Elves went back to their old Daedra worship.  
With the death of the Tribunal, the pilgrims stopped coming to the temples. This led to the moonlet Baar Dau, which was stopped by Vivec and made into the Ministry of Truth, to crash into the land with all it's original force, since the only thing keeping it in the air was the levitation potions, which were offered by the many pilgrims. This caused Red Mountain to erupt, destroying Vvardenfell and parts of Morrowind. The Dark Elves, weakened and surprised, were then attacked by the Argonians of Argonia, who were told by the Hist to wait for the comet strike. This was the end of Morrowind. The Dunmer were either killed, or scattered across Tamriel, most notably to the island Solstheim, to the north of Vvardenfell. Skyrim, who had been at war with Morrowind for centuries over the island, resigned their claim of the island, so that the Dunmer could find refuge there.

It could just be a continuity mistake by the writers of Bethesda, but we have to keep in mind that there are hundreds if not thousand of people/tribes/etc. in Tamriel that have no contact to the outside world. Do they know about eras? 

And furthermore: Do all the regions of Tamriel accept the era-changes? Especially the Argonians, the Khajiit and the Orsimer always seemed to appreciate their independence and I think they couldn't care less if some bloke in the Imperial City takes over the throne and declares the start of the Second Era.

1371554508.0,45,self.teslore,1gktvy,Is Mehrunes Dagon leading the Thalmor?,DaemonDanton,61,16,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1gktvy/is_mehrunes_dagon_leading_the_thalmor/,"Okay, either everyone's already figured this out before me, or that title sounds a little crazy.  Either way, this is my first major post here, so here goes.

Most of this theory stems from ""[The Seven Fights of The Aldudagga](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/seven-fights-aldudagga).""  In the first fight, Dagon is cursed by Alduin (thereby becoming Dagon).  The curse is to last until Dagon destroys all of the extra world that he hid for Alduin to eat.  This is why Dagon is so destructive: he has to destroy a great deal of creation to end his curse.

Now, my first thought was that burning the land and wrecking cities does not sound like an effective way to destroy parts of the world.  Does that really satisfy the terms of the curse?  Does it leave Alduin with less to eat?  That's mostly digression and speculation, though, and I'll get to evidence that's a little more measurable.

It seems to be a general consensus on this subreddit, as I have observed, that if the Thalmor were to destroy all of the towers, it would simply reset the current kalpa (in contrast to their theories of ascension).  It would seem to end the kalpa a little bit differently from how most end, though.  Would Alduin still need to devour the world in this case?  Perhaps all kalpas end simply when all of the towers are destroyed (I can think of a few good arguments toward that), but there is no evidence that I know of.

What if destroying the destroying of the towers dismembered creation enough to end Dagon's curse?

The Oblivion Crisis destroyed two towers: White-Gold and Crystal-Like-Law (and maybe others that I've forgotten).  What if that was Dagon's entire intention?

As for his leading the Thalmor now, it's not quite as strange as it sounds.  Note this passage from the Second Fight of the Aldudagga:

&gt;Herkel Shield-Fed now looked at Dagon cockeyed and said, ""Wait, it was you who sent that horde of elves who, though pierced to their five-thousandth rank, would not be stopped?"" to which Dagon responded, ""Of course! Though it was easy, as they hated you anyway, but yes, yes, it was I who stoked the fire in grim dreams and mirrors, which has only now saw fit to stop burning!...""

The way I see it, it's not much different for Dagon to convince the Thalmor - who certainly are not lacking in hatred for pretty much everyone else - to launch a war.  Convincing them to focus their efforts on the towers is a little more specific, but still doesn't seem like a huge stretch when you consider the second fight.

So what do you guys think?  Was this obvious?  Is this crazy?  Is it the most brilliant and insightful thing to ever be posted here?  Is it even remotely possible?

EDIT: I keep seeing one major critique (in this thread and others) due to a lack of clarity on my part, so I'm going to try to remedy that.  I am *not* saying that the Thalmor are taking orders from Dagon.  Dagon is ""stoking the fire in grim dreams"" and otherwise manipulating them, but in no way would the Thalmor be aware of this.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1371632318.0,,Tribunal,True,t3_1gktvy,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1gktvy/is_mehrunes_dagon_leading_the_thalmor/,

Once the brain has finished developing, this happens with females around the age of eighteen, and males at around twenty five, the clock starts to slow down. 

In the average, healthy altmer, the time taken between each human year of aging will be about double. A female altmer will spend two years in the human equivalent of nineteen, four years as twenty, eight as twenty one, and so on. 

The rate at which the aging slows down varies between the races, but generally it’s at about 1,2 for orcs, 1,5 for dunmer and 1,7 for bosmer. Bretons tend to age at a rate of 1,3. There are individual differences, of course, but they rarely stray too far. Below is a table of average lifespans of a noble mer of strong blood. Living beyond this is extremely rare, and one of lesser birth are likely to have much shorter lives. 

[Table 1, Average Lifespan for a fine Mer.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mem4qosrnr1rte2x5.jpg)

With age also comes an increase in magicka, a soul that grows more and more in tune with the magical energies of the world. When the body no longer can take any more of the energies, most often because the mind is too weak, but sometimes because of the flesh, the process will flip, the aging going quicker, to the point where there are tales of mer who you could see age before your very eyes. 

The table underneath shows the last common age for a mer to peak, and the human equivalent of that age.

I'm not very sure about this but I think they might worship Hircine. Think about it, they tame bristlebacks and have spears, so they are clearly hunters. Boar tusks can often be found on the bodies of Rieklings, indicating that they also hunt for sport, not just survival. Animal skulls and bones are a large part of their architecture too.

Something I find strange though, and throws me off a bit is that in one of their caves they can be seen worshiping a strange display: a carriage with a horse attached made out of the bones of other animals, or at least that's what I remember, but it's been a while since I saw that.

Submit your favorite lore!,chesko256,50,7,93,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/v1z96/lorebased_loading_screens_help_me_build_a_skyrim/,"Hey everyone. I'd like to put together a new mod for Skyrim to address how repetitive the text on the loading screens can get, while at the same time, educating folks about the Elder Scrolls series' deep and storied past in the downtime between transitioning areas. Let no two loading screens be the same again!

But, I am far from a lore master, and I need your help!

What I am looking for are **concise, informative text blurbs** describing **interesting, surprising, unique, or little-known facts** from the Elder Scrolls series many sources (past games, in-game books, and so on).

If you are interested in helping out and submitting an entry for this mod (thanks!), please observe the following guidelines:

* Entries should be **no longer than 250 characters long**. This equates to about 4 lines of text in the bottom right corner of the screen. For reference, the longest loading screen text string that appears in the vanilla game is 210 characters. Try to keep it short. You can use [this page](http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/charcount.shtml) to check your character count.

* You must have **excellent grammar**. I will not spend time rewriting entries.

* **Avoid controversial lore, or lore from non-Bethesda sources.** This includes some of Michael Kirkbride's work outside of his official work at Bethesda. Information that is intentionally ambiguous in the lore itself is fine (See: Warp in the West, etc), but in these cases, avoid speaking in absolute terms.

* **Use an in-world style of writing.** Avoid phrases such as, ""In the game Morrowind, the dunmer tribespeople played a key role in fulfilling the Nerevarine Prophecy."" You would instead say, ""The dunmer tribespeople of the 3rd Era played a key role in fulfilling the Nerevarine Prophecy.""

* **Preface your submission with ""SUB:""**. This will help me be able to easily find submissions in this thread and filter out comments and questions separately. Example: ""SUB: The dunmer tribespeople of the 3rd Era played a key role in fulfilling the Nerevarine Prophecy.""

* **Short, interesting quotes from in-game writings and characters** are fine, provided that the quote can stand on its own and be understood, as long as it is followed by the source. Example: ""But our brethren, the Dwemer, scorned the Daedra, and mocked our foolish rituals, and preferred instead their gods of Reason and Logic."" -- Vivec

* **Creating a submission does not guarantee that it will appear in the mod.** I reserve the right to choose what becomes a part of the mod. Reasons for not being included may include not following the above guidelines, two entries that essentially state the same thing, or ""because I said so"". That being said, my desire is to get as many high quality entries as possible. I always want a new surprise in store for players when staring at a loading screen.

* **I reserve the right to edit your submission** for minor grammatical issues while keeping the spirit of the entry intact.

Thanks for your understanding. I'm trying to set the quality bar high.    

If I add your entry to the mod, I will note your username in the credits exactly as it appears here. If this is not the username you would like me to put in the credits, let me know! I will keep a running spreadsheet of submissions and the associated username, so I can keep everything straight.

I hope this request goes over well. You all are the lore buffs, and I knew if I wanted to get the richest information, I would have to come here to ask. I look forward to your feedback. I have created [other](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163) [mods](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/17416) for Skyrim, and I hope the folks here can help me bring this one to life as well.

I am cross-posting this to the official Bethesda [Skyrim Mods](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1383471-wip-lore-based-loading-screens-help-me-create-this-mod-submit-your-favorite-lore/) and [Elder Scrolls Lore](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1383474-wip-lore-based-loading-screens-help-me-create-a-new-skyrim-mod-submit-your-favorite-lore/) forums. I will be monitoring all of these threads and compiling submissions.

Thanks for reading.

**UPDATE 1:**
Between all threads, over **50 new loading screens** have been generated, in just a few hours. :O Thanks!!

Keep them coming! I'm recording and categorizing them now, so that they'll be accompanied by an appropriate image on the loading screen.

**Some low-hanging fruit I see are**: more information on the Tribunal (individually or as a whole), excerpts from the 36 Lessons (hard to make these quotes stand on their own, but I'm sure there's a few), and the major events of Oblivion (Kvatch, etc).

1329055469.0,40,self.teslore,pm17l,Lets Talk Dunmer!,ADP101,45,5,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pm17l/lets_talk_dunmer/,"Morrowind was my favorite setting for any TES game. I loved the unique culture that the Dunmer had and the Lore surrounding them and Morrowind itself. We are all used to the Imperial culture of Cyrodiil and the Anglo-Saxon culture of Skyrim but the giant Telvanni towers, the Cantons of Vivec, the giant mushroom trees always caught my imagination. I'm replaying the game with MGSO and everything looks 10x better then it did when I first played the game.

With you my fellow scholars I wish to discuss the current state of the Dunmer people, the Tribunal temple, and the lands of Morrowind. What we know: Vivec disappeared at the end of the third era, the Nevararine killed Almalexia in Tribunal, and as seen in Morrowind, Sotha Sil wasent looking too good. The Tribunal temple is in shambles. The major religion of the Tribunal temple had lost all of its Gods and Nerevarine had defeated Dagoth Ur and proved the beliefs of the Tribunal as false.

Following was the Oblivion crisis in which i believe I read Ald'ruhn was destroyed by the Daedra. But in the long run, that didn't even matter. With the disappearance of Vivec no one was there to hold up the Ministry of Truth above Vivec city and it crashed into the ground causing the Red Mountain to erupt. Vvardenfell and its inhabitants were essentially liquidated. The people on the shores were maybe able to escape in time but the people in cities such as Balmora and Caldera were not so lucky. The ash from the eruption ruined the air around Vvardenfell, and many Dunmer are said to have died from that East and West of Vvardenfell. Leaving only south Morrowind and Solstheim inhabitable. 

Next important chain of events. With the weakening of the Empire, the Black Marsh attacked Morrowind from the South and are said to have control of Southern Morrowind, including Mournhold, the capital. House Telvanni is said to be all but destroyed. The last of the Telvanni boarded ""The Pride of Tel Vos"" whose remains can by found in Skyrim. House Redoran's capital was destroyed during the Oblivion crisis but it still has Blacklight on the mainlaind, though it was mentioned in Oblivion that it was under attack by Orcs and Nords from the west and the ash from the Red Mountain most likely had a major effect on the city. Theres nothing of House Hlaalu but they were most likely destroyed in the eruption. House Indoril and Dres were most likely destroyed in the Argonian invasion as they were in the Morrowind heartland and southern Morrowind. 

Many Dunmer fled to Solsthiem after these two events. I'm going to assume there's a strong presence there but only in the southern half as they north is uninhabitable. The others fled to West. There's an unwelcome Dunmer population in Eastern Skyrim. I'm assuming many fled to Cyrodiil, Hamerfell, and Daggerfell. Its unknown if the Argonians attacked isles around Morrowind or how much the isles were impacted by the ash from the explosion. The status of Sadrith Mora in east Vvardenfell, Dagon Fel in the north and the other mid sized islands in the area are currently unknown. 

So what now? The Great Houses and formed the Dunmer political system for the past 4 eras are eliminated and their religion is extinct. They either went back to their ancestor worship system, the imperial cult, or daedric worship. The Dunmer are also naturally gifted in magic as seen in Morrowind. I feel like that somehow impacts the current state of existence where ever they are. And we cant forget about the many Dunmer still in mainland Morrowind under Argonian rule. Vvardenfell has most likely become re-inhabitable after 200 years (imagining all the Dunmer ruins to explore gives me a semi-chubb). The Dunmer relations with other provinces and the Empire is still unknown. The empire had an extremely large military presence in Morrowind in TES III. But Morrowind itself didnt have any involvement in the Great War because of the eruption and following invasion.

The Dunmer race is at a crucial point in its existence. It must establish Political and Religious stability if it is to survive as a culture. Thoughts? I'm hoping for a good discussion.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,True,,,True,t3_pm17l,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pm17l/lets_talk_dunmer/,

Among them was King Wulfharth Who-Was-Ysmir, Derek the Tall, Mikjir Mud-Eater (who took name and talent from the Merkiller), Mora Bellysinger, Hroki the Red, Karl Hjormir, Jeorr Ice-Teeth, Felja Fire-Beard, Jurgen Windcaller and many more among them.

As they walked and sang and chuckled the shell-homes of the Devils crumbled and fell though the dwarves who made their homes of rock would fight and hide and fight again until not even they knew if the battle was over. With Voice came power and with power came safety and with safety came ignorance. Shor applauded from afar as the Dwemer died yet kept quiet as the Devils were crushed and is still confusing as the Dagoth Devil rarely made complaint.

*****

Before them came the Red Mountain.

The battle was harsh, fierce and hard to remember. Before the climb to Kagrenac - that is now Devil Dagoth's home - Shor and Wulfharth, God and King, raced up the mountainside on the Faith-Cat who may not have been there. As the Tongues crushed and burned and froze and ripped the heroes above fought these evils: Dumac Dwarfking, Vehk the Devil, Moon-and-Star (whose hands spoke destiny, whose father was the serpent-shadow of Shor, whose shield-wife was many-faced) and Devil Dagoth whose loyalty is obscured to all. As the terrible fighting continued, both spirit-of-Shor and Wulfharth were defeated and Kyne had to lift the ashes from Hell, where God-Mirror was born, and back to the home of Snow-Throat. 

When Jurgen saw this and the deaths of many other Tongues he cried out to the winds but had a dead throat. He saw, shocked and terrified, how Strong Voices could fail. At once he left, to return to the land which was made theirs to reflect on this.

*****

Year 1

200 or Some More days of refusing to Shout, Jurgen had sat upon the plains of Jarl Gjalund's hold and stared up through winds and clouds til he slept. His body was raised by Kyne where he felt feathered and filled with her air. Through the skies he saw cloud-dances of dragons flying and falling; men-shapes that would bend to their own kind and that of one Voice-master whom never spoke yet was king over all. A gentle whisper slithered through Jurgen and he knew it was Kyne as he dropped slowly and gently back to the grassbed he left. And he said nothing.

Year 2

Jurgen walked with Mora Bellysinger to the new city of Markarth, which was built of Dwarven minds and arms. The city had been occupied by some savage men of the west and even some Snow Elves, whom cowered at the song of Mora Bellysinger, which is forgotten. Windcaller and Bellysinger entered the Stone Palace of Nchuand-Zel and looked upon the symbols and metal-men of the Dwemer, which were hatred and ignorance. Mora was boiling with rage and shouted the metal into bends and peices of those both living and not, Jurgen chose to sit down on the cold stone as more of the metal-men surrounded them until they had no escape when Jurgen hummed deep and soft. The humming of Jurgen shook the stone and the metal men until even their false symbols could not save them.

Mora had then chosen to stay silent with Jurgen until she would sing with him, which would not happen.

Year 3

Mora had died. Jurgen had been depressed since and sat in the mud-ponds of Eastmarch, he looked into the hot pond and saw himself staring back. He looked into the water as it rippled and trembled his face image, wondering of his path, his world, his life and his faith. Violently he had been pulled back by Mikjir Mud-Eater, whom thought he walked upon a man ready to drown himself. The friends greeted each other by ways of the hand and Mikjir was confused by Jurgen's silence; he had decided to bite into the mud-pond and spit towards Jurgen though the mud slid off him with ease. New life was not thrown into him, for new life had already begun.

Year 4

This year has never been sung, for Jurgen had achieved a following from his friend Mikjir; all whom followed Jurgen in this time would never write nor speak nor sing at all and this carried on for 400 or less days. Those who followed either died or left or went mad, not even Mikjir stayed with Jurgen.

Year 5

Jurgen stayed in Hillgrund's Steading until he was gifted with 20 bottles of Mede from the town's marketers and 5 jars of honey from Sveinhelf Seven-Toes, who ran the town in those early days. With these gifts, Jurgen drank and ate as he walked upwards of MONAH-VEN. On his journey he met a pilgrim, whose name is told later, and she stared deeply at Jurgen who was still confused. The pilgrim knocked him down ruthlessly, then kissed Jurgen, whose lips were sweet with honey, then fell into the snow for later travellers to find. He still did not know, but he would learn later.

Year 6

Jurgen had made himself a small ice-home near the place Winds Allow None as it would briefly be known. Stuck before he could reach the peak, this is when Jurgen broke his silence and commanded the winds to let him pass for his Voice had grown stronger than any others when it had been used so scarcely. Jurgen was pushed back into the snow when he Shouted at them and the winds flew into Jurgen and raced within him knocking him backwards and forwards and back again until he returned to silence at which point they left. Jurgen was close to seeing the truth but needed one last step.

Year 7

Jurgen was allowed passage through the winds, to a place at which even Ice Wraiths dared not to challenge him. He returned to the Throat of the World where he met a Dragon whom he knew by name that was ""Paarthurnax"". The Dov first tried to burn Jurgen but he ate it. Then the Dov tried to freeze him and Jurgen ate it. Then he tried to push Jurgen but that too was eaten. Paarthurnax then told the story of how he freed JUL and had been thrown into outcast and had to flee from mankind. For time uncounted, as Paarthurnax never knew how, he had wondered why he would have risen so high to be dropped down into an outcast above a mountain, until Jurgen could teach Paarthurnax the true words of power.

MUL THU'UM FUNT

These are the words that comfort Paarthurnax when he tries to remember his power.


******

The Shout-Eating of Jurgen the Calm

When Jurgen lived in stone, underneath the death-bringing winds that were further atop MONAHVEN, 17 strong Tongues came to battle Jurgen who they saw as a traitor and madman. Jurgen had known this day would come and shouted into the snow ""MUL THU'UM FUNT"", even though the Tongues were too proud to care for his warning. Grimwehlt and Tsjari and Fjorli and Jora and the many Reds and others had all come in front of High Hrothgar and challenged Jurgen. Jurgen would refuse to fight them and Fjorli became irritated so began to Shout towards Jurgen; and as she did the many others joined her in deafening and thundering Thu'um.

Jurgen stood, relaxed and jaw hanging for the attack that would have ripped even Ysgramor into the snow. As such, Jurgen remained eating the Shouts for 3 days as the fury of the Tongues was roaring towards him and echoing throughout all of Keizaal and Jerall. The Tongues had to stop, weary and fatigued as they dropped into the snow where the warning had layed and they still did not know what he had. Jurgen calmly walked towards the Tongues and whispered to them.

The winds had calmed, the cold became less bitter, even the moons had gone full and shone down onto Nirn.

I've been lurking here for a bit and recently decided it was time to start posting. If I make any stupid newby mistakes please let me know :)

So my theory is that only willing dragons are capable of being soul trapped. Now as we all know it is impossible to soul trap dragons. Originally I had thought that this was just Gameplay but then I thought about how the dragonborns were so valued for being the ultimate dragon slayer because they could absorb the soul of a dragon and how if it was possible for anybody to just soul trap a dragon and prevent them from being resurrected that way then they wouldn't be so valued. Which would make you think that dragons can't be soul trapped except for the fact that our Dragonborn (who has the soul of a dragon) gets soul trapped himself, twice in Skyrim (once in Azura's quest and once in Dawnguard). So I thought about it and as far as I can tell the only difference was that both times the Dragonborn was willing to be soul trapped. 

I'm unsure exactly how Durnehviir got into the soul cairn but considering he isn't undead himself it's possible that he was also soul trapped and as he went in there as part of a deal with the Ideal Masters he obviously would have been willing.

So the Redguards have an Afterlife, similar to the Nordic Sovngarde, called the 'Far Shores'. On the way to the Shores they are protected by Tu'whacca From Sep. 

Sep is considered to be Redguard pantheons interpretation of Lorkhan, the creator of the mortal plane. Sep tries to disrupt Mortal entry to the Far shores. Why?

In the Nordic pantheon Sep is replaced by Shor. But Shor actively protects the Nords and wishes to see them to Sovngarde. He however only allows the bravest Nords entry. 

So my Question is: why would Shor (the God of men) try and prevent the Redguards entering their afterlife? 

I had a theory, that the reason that Shor only excepts the bravest nords into Sovngarde (and even then they have to pass another test to enter his hall) is that he plans to use their sprites as warriors in a future conflict between the gods. If this is the case, would that mean the Redguards will be on the opposing side?

I noticed they are both magical versions of mundane animals that are more darkly coloured than usual, and have glowing red eyes. Death hounds are surrounded by a black smoke, not unlike the black smoking and bubbling around shadowmere upon his/her arrival in Skyrim. Becoming undead seems to be the easiest way to become immortal in the elder scrolls universe. Becoming a lich or a vampire seem to be the most common way to extend one's lifespan. Glowing eyes also seem to be associated with the undead. (See draugr, skeletons, vampires)

Is it possible there is some sort of ritual where the animal is offered to a daedric prince or something. Maybe Molag bal? (Death hounds appear to be undead, and are associated with vampires, shadowmere is associated with the dark brotherhood, who seem to commonly employ vampires.)

Or maybe boethia, to create a creature of creating greater bloodshed.  (Grasping at straws but the black smoke reminded me of the smoke around the ebony mail)

There's a space left conspicuously empty. We'll get back to that. If you haven't gotten through at least half the main story of Skyrim, **do not read any further, spoilers ahead**.

When the Dragonborn retrieves the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller for the Greybeards, they greet him thus (as translated by Arngeir):

""Long has the **Stormcrown** languished, with no worthy brow to sit upon. By our breath we bestow it now to you in the name of Kyne, in the name of **Shor**, and in the name of Atmora of Old. You are **Ysmir** now, the Dragon of the North, hearken to it."" (emphasis mine)

The Stormcrown, the last time it was seen, was Wulfharth manifesting as a raging storm on Hjalti Early-Beard's head. The Dragonborn receives the Stormcrown in the name of Kynareth and Lorkhan, when accounting for Nordic names. Further, the Dragonborn is proclaimed as Ysmir.

Through the name of Lorkhan, the Dragonborn is proclaimed to have become at least one Avatar of Lorkhan.

This, in my mind, sets the Dragonborn up to fill the seventh spot as the last avatar of Lorkhan.

This volume will deal with the Orcs. Even though there is much prejudice towards them, they are definitely worthy of study. Without further ado, here is the volume on the Orcs of High Rock.*


The Orcs ( sometimes referred to by the elves as 'Orsimer', meaning 'Pariah folk', although they themselves do not use this name) are the green skinned people of Orsinium, in the Wrothgarian mountains of High Rock. The orcs have long been resented by the other species of Tamriel, both for their xenophobic culture and their strange appearance.

Even though the Orcs find their heritage in the Aldmeri settlers who followed the god Trinimac (which will be explained later), they retain little more than the pointed ears so common to the mer of Tamriel. Indeed, they don't share the longevity the elves have (a Orc is already of venerable age if he/she reaches 60), and where the mer have a slender and agile build, the Orcs are very big and broad, which also accounts for their incredible strength.  
They have a green skin colour, a nose that resembles that of a beast (which explains their physique being described as scary or angry), and a severe malocclusion, with their lower incisors forming in upright tusks, making it almost impossible for Orcs to fully close their lips.  
The Orcs have a slight resistance to Magicka, and are able to work themselves in a uncontrollable berserk state. This attributes both to the hatred towards them, as well as their reputation as the best soldiers in the Imperial Legion.

As stated earlier, the Orcs are descendents of the Aldmeri settlers in High Rock who followed Trinimac. Trinimac was at some point god of the elven strength, as he had led them against the menkinds. He was patron of soldiers and warriors. At some point he was 'eaten' by the Daedric prince Boethiah, to convince the Orsimer and Chimer of the power of the Daedra. The followers of Trinimac were then cursed, and turned into the currently seen Orcs. When this happened is unknown, but, since the Orcs were already changed at the start of the First Eras, it should have been in the late Merethic Era. Some time after this transformation, Trinimac reappeared as the Daedric prince Malacath, a shell of his former self. Still, the Orcs hold great respect for this Daedric prince, and venerate him.

The society of the Orcs is based around the Codes of Malacath, a list of unrwritten rules, passed orally throughout Orcish culture. These rules includes things as no theft, fighting valiantly and the importance of your tribe and family, along with the idea that isolation is a blessing. These codes have shaped Orcish culture to what it is now today.  
Seeing their views on isolation, many Orcs live in tribal strongholds, scattered throughout North-Western Tamriel (a notable exception is of course the historical city state Orsinium). These tribes are ruled by a chieftain. The chieftain is the only one allowed to breed, and the only women in the stronghold are directly affiliated to him (as mother, wife or daughter). This rule does not apply to male inhabitants. The chief has multiple wives, some of which have their own role in the stronghold (for instance, the second wife is called the 'forge wife', and oversees the armour and weapon forging of the stronghold). The daughters of the chieftain are given or traded to other chieftains, as a sign of goodwill and to prevent inbreeding.  
Family is incredibly important to the Orcs, and their nomenclature shows this. Each Orc gets a personal name, a prefix to denote gender ( 'gro-' for males and 'gra-' for females), followed directly by their same-sex parent. In case the same-sex parents is unknown, the child gets the name of the other-sex parent.  
Just like the Nords of Skyrim, the Orcs have a strong warrior culture. It is ideal that a Orc dies on the battlefield fighting, as this shows valor. Furthermore, they take great piride in both their smithing and their personal strength.  

Their relation with the other species on Tamriel is troubled at best. The Orcs do not see the need to shape themselves to other cultures, which forms a vicious circle with the already present resentment towards them. The Orcs hold a hatred towards both men and mer, the men because of their presence in the Wrothgarian Mountains, and the long lasting conflict for territory, and the elves for their use of magic (the Orcs see killing from afar as a sign of weakness). This despise towards other races also strengthens the despise they feel for the Orcs.  
As troubled as the relations of the Orcs are, so troubled is their own kingdom Orsinium. This kingdom, finding itself in a region which has always been troubled with constant wars between small states, has been target of many attacks by the other kingdoms, which at some point united just to destroy it.

The Orcs are some of the best armourers and warriors in all of Tamriel. There armour is fabled as being incredibly strong, albeit being very, very heavy. It is mostly made from Orichalcum, a somewhat rare metal found throughout Western Tamriel.  
As strong as their armour is, so strong are their warriors. An Orc is a worthy adversary at any time, and one that goes into his berserk state is a force to reckon with. Because of their strong and heavy physique and lifelong training in the arts of combat, the Empire has employed them as front-men in the legion. Their service in the legion made them a bit more accepted in the Empire (especially in Cyrodiil), but they are still seen as pariah by the fast majority (indeed, many people still believe the Orcs are actually kin to the goblins).

As stated earlier, the history of Orcs starts at the transformation of Trinimac into Malacath, and their own transformation from Aldmer to Orsimer.  
Somewhere in the First Era, the Orcs created the first Orsinium. Over time, it grew to such a size that it was regarded as a threat to the other kingdoms. The kingdoms of Daggerfall and Sentinel formed an alliance with the Order of the Diagna, and destroyed Orsinium in 1E 980.  
Over the next centuries, the Orcs repeatedly tried to raise a new Orsinium, but failed every time, until Gortwog gro-Nagorm created the new kingdom of Orsinium in 3E 399. Through Gortwog's excellent diplomacy and politics, Orsinium prospered without major armed conflicts, but was still not officially recognised by the Empire. During the Warp in the West, Orsinium was one of the four kingdoms to use the Numidium to gain territory and swore fealty to the Empire. After almost 400 years under Imperial control, the status of Orsinium as independent province was finally in sight, until it was yet again sacked during the early fourth era, this time by a united army of High Rock and Hammerfell. This caused Orsinium to relocate to the border between Skyrim and Hammerfell, and many Orcs fleeing east.

*In short, the Orcs have always been Pariah, because of their history, their attitude towards other races, and their appearance. Still, there are many traits worthy of envy of them, like their strength and excellent armouring.*

Hopefully this isn't necessarily retreading an oft-tread ground. Also, this is a cheap defense but English is not my native language yada yada.*

One of the constant themes of TES games is that an insignificant prisoner whose defining trait is unimportance (this is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, but in latter games, nobody knows, remembers, recognizes or cares what they look like until they are thrust into the prophecy) ends up becoming the most significant and important person in their respective stories. Disregarding destiny in the form of the Elder Scrolls as writer fiat, this seems somewhat arbitrary. If a perfect nobody could end up slaying gods, embody a cosmic principle or destroy world-destroyers, why can't it be somebody else? They have no fundamental motivation to pursue such hardship, since they have neither pre-established memory from which to guide future actions nor predisposed feelings and beliefs which incline them to respond to their situation. They themselves don't know what these are until the immediate situation requires them to realize them -- an existential ambiguity represented in the form of (player) choice.

Aside destiny, there is no reason for the player character/s to be the hero, so it seems reasonable to claim that it really is destiny. The franchise is named after a collection of prophecies, after all. But this would conflict with the fact that the player character/s make many countless choices (or perhaps they *are* choices). For a prophecy to be true and have any sort of worth, it needs to happen in the end. While the specific terms and conditions may vary, nothing that contradicts with that statement can be true. What meaning is destiny that doesn't come to be? Retrospectively, that's just a conjecture or a possibility. Yet, the player character/s are those conjectures and possibilities -- they can contribute to the apotheosis of a death-defiling god, become the protector and director of an ancient order of freelance executioners, assert Imperial hegemony over Skyrim by squashing the rebels, or whatsoever on. They can do all of these things, some of these things and none of these things. It's up to the player character/s to decide.

But there is still one world. Different choices do not rewrite the world-in-entirety each time they occur. One of the most significant and blatant things that happened to address this is the Warp in the West. Destiny as foretold by the Elder Scrolls is still told the same, regardless of when it is told. (Though, there is a difference in how much sense they make with the crystal-clear lens of retrospection.)

The premise of the rant so far is this: destiny is the quality that makes the Hero Prisoner/s significant, yet they take actions which should crash against the retroactive future storytelling that is prophecy.

A proposed solution to this incongruity is this: the distinction is imaginary. As imaginary as the supposed gap between identity-as-self and universality-as-Godhead, perhaps. The player character/s' destiny and freedom are one and the same -- by electing to do something beyond what the prophecy requires, that choice *becomes* a part of the prophecy. In a way, this could be seen as an anteroactive revision of a retroactive revision. Warp in the West occurred not for the sake of resolving timeline conflict, but because the Agent was always ""meant"" to ""end up"" causing.

In the Elder Scrolls universe, prophecies are real. Something that happens in the future can thus affect the present. By this effect, the present changes the once-future, which in turn changes the once-present. The Hero Prisoner -- the ambiguous nobody -- is the vehicle of this effect: because they have no past, they are the most sensible ones to manifest the past that evolves according to the future. Certain other entities in the universe might also reflect this nature of destiny, such as once-mortal Vehk who is also always-god Vehk.

The Hero Prisoner/s always had, have and always will have the freedom to act according to the destiny, because that is their destiny to be free. They have choice-non-choice, in which they can simultaneously do everything they choose to do and nothing they can't choose to do at once. The unimportant Hero Prisoner is made important because their unimportance makes them important.

**tl;dr #1**: For a reality where future can influence the past through prophecies and destinies, it is necessary that freedom and destiny are one and the same. The Hero Prisoner/s are the most immediate and comprehensible manifestation of this nature because the player creates their past by acting in the present -- a choice-non-choice that is made in the future.

So the rambling so far explains the more agreeable understanding of the Elder Scrolls series of mine. But the main motivation to make this post is elaborated here, after a section break, since it's somewhat of a crack theory which doesn't need to be agreeable for the former to be also.

The theory is this: The Hero Prisoner/s *are* the Elder Scrolls. They are the points in universe that change past, present and future all at once. The Champion of Cyrodiil succeeding the throne and divinity of Sheogorath changed who the Last Dragonborn meets in Pelagius III's memories. The Nerevarine choosing to follow their destiny made Azura's prophecy/plot that was once revealed/fabricated in the past true and real. The Last Dragonborn's destiny to slay Alduin required Alduin to be thrown outside time in the past. None of this would have happened had the Eternal Champion not do what they were always meant to do.

When their story is told, it is what was always meant to be. Everything in the past is arranged to make that future. The future happens as it does because of the conditions set in the past. Destiny, in the form of the Elder Scrolls, is the only one that truly has agency. Simultaneously, the only one that truly has agency is destiny, in the form of the Elder Scrolls.

This pushes this idea further into the fringe and I fear mentioning this concept again, but this may be the appearance of CHIM to classical understanding of time/causality/destiny. An entity -- the archetype or the spirit of the Hero Prisoner/s -- penetrates all reality because, from an outside perspective, reality isn't exactly real. The impossible nature of a free agent in a universe where future already exists is made possible by an alien intervention that goes beyond the parameters of that universe.

The player character is the Elder Scrolls because what they do and are is destiny.

**tl;dr #2**: The Elder Scrolls series is named after its main character. The various Hero Prisoners that are revealed in the games are one constant and consistent being.

---

*An Aside*

I realize that this is contentious to think of CHIM as a meta mechanic (such as it being console commands or fourth-wall breaking), but maybe the only way to make the concept actually relevant to the setting is by introducing an impossible influence in the form of the player. To the player, time and reality that are solid from the in-character perspective are naked bare. Within the world, only microscopic portions of them are revealed, leading to limited understanding that make the world convincing -- a universe populated by nothing but buddhas would be unintriguing. But the player considers everything in their entirety, having a perspective that is impossible and incomprehensible to (most of) the characters.

But, still, the player might still be limited. It is Bethesda who makes the Elder Scrolls games, after all.

And I find it extremely interesting how the player character is able to soultrap powerful npcs, and use their souls to power enchantments rivaling the power of daedric artifacts.


For example, the soul of Vivec can be trapped in azuras star, and be used to enchant a lovely little hat, or a nice pair of boots. Or whatever you fancy.


Considering how even the dwemer used enchanting techniques involving soul gems, and how well-known and well-documented some enchanters work are - like Kagnarac and Radac.. I can't help but wonder: Could some of the more fabled artifacts have been made from the souls of mighty heroes and villains and demigods of myth? And enchanted by known master wizards?


Could some random walking staff with a tint of light enchantment contain the soul of a once mighty sorceror? Or a disgraced daedroth?


The first numidium is surely an example of one such (albeit very large) artifact. - At one point, powered by the soul of one or more mythic historical persons through the mantella..


But what about the most infamous daedric artifacts of lore?




Youd rarely see any new items spawned by the god lords.. - so could it be, that these items are just the favorite tools acquired by the daedra, and not original creations made by themself?



Take spellbreaker as an example. This artifact is clearly of dwemer origin, but is claimed by and associated with Periyte. But who enchanted spellbreaker? What soul does it contain?


This is but one of many mysteries..



But I'm certain that no enchanter would let a strong soul go to waste, so may be, just maybe, we should consider exploring the insides of enchanted items more properly, categorize and date them as best as possible, and perhaps even keep a register of known times of deaths of famous and strongwilled individuals..",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1374828403.0,,Telvanni,True,t3_1j29du,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1j29du/the_powerful_souls_of_artifacts_and_the/,

Most of these names start with a prefix, and a rare hyphenated suffix.

On a side note, this topic was made to shed some light on how Khajiiti are named, as we do not know such a in depth understanding.

Each prefix has a meaning, and is usually an earned title, which the hyphenated suffixes are albeit unknown. Most of these titles symbolize a predesignated *job* or social class.

Already known titles are as follows:

* Dar - A thief, or clever individual, showing cunning and thought, strife.
* Do - Honored warrior, or fighter, *et cetera*, the only known 'Do's' are the guards of the Khajiiti leader the Mane.
* Dro - Symbolizes a family title to that of a grandparent.
* J/Ji/Ja - A young adult, one of new life, or a bachelor, or newcomer.
* Jo - A wizard, master of a magick school, or of many teachings.
* M/Ma - To show virginity, or a child, or student.
* Ra - Status symbols, or influential person.
* Ri - Also shows status, though in the more higher form of that of a leader.
* S - An adult, or older person, elder.
* Qa - A rare, seemingly unknown title.

Some Khajiit do not adopt or earn any title, such as [this](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vasha) character.

Due to the nature of some Khajiit groups in their home of Elsweyr to be somewhat tribal in nature, they earn these titles by way of life, whether it be from passage, to even at birth determining the sign they are under when they are among their litter of other Khajiit kittens.

* *Asha* kills her first werelion, her father, S'ano, grants her the title **J'asha**.
* *Ujanad*, born under the Waxing Masser and Full Secunda moons, and under the sign of Shadow, is given the *Dar* title, making him **Dar'ujanad**.

Likewise, suffixes can be used in the same context for a name. This is equivalent to giving a Khajiit a second class or *job*.

* Dar'ujanad decides to go into illusion magic, and his master renames him Dar'ujanad**-jo**.

Though, some Khajiit consider the suffix option of naming to be foolish, or unnecessary.

EDIT: I suppose I should explain how I thought it was initially.

When I first began to play TES and read about the Firmament and the Anuad and all that I thought that the Void, or space, was essentially the same as how it is in real life, but with the stars being spherical tears in the fabric of reality and into Aetherius. I thought that there might be invisible tears that led to Oblivion and that magick was what held everything together, not forces we know today. I thought that Nirn and all the other plane(t)s orbited Magnus, just like planets do but with all our terms for the forces replaced with magick. Then I learned about the Godhead and all that and I thought my theories were solidified because if the universe of TES was based off of the real world by some being then surely everything works the same, just with magick keeping everything moving. Armageist makes a good point. Baan Dar couldn't possibly be an actual living being, it's obviously an asteroid. I can understand the Plane(t)s being ""perceived"" as spherical because our mortal minds cannot physically comprehend infinity...because we can't, but taking everything said by in game characters would be silly, they can't possibly know what we know about space with their current level of technology. I've been in love with astronomy since I was young, I've always looked up at the sky and stared in wonder and I tried to apply my knowledge to Nirn.

Andre Granius

**Introduction:**

The Bosmer (Wood Elves) are not known for their maritime tradition, but it is fascinating nonetheless.

The Green Pact, the Pact between the proto-Bosmer and the Forest God Y’ffre, is a well known facet of Bosmeri culture; it established the central tenets of the Bosmeri people, and it affects life in Valenwood even today. For instance, the Green Pact forbids the use of any plant matter, alive or dead, for personal or societal benefit. Therefore, the entirety of Bosmeri culture is built upon what seems, at first, to be an economical impossibility. The Bosmer do well enough in spite of their cultural lifestyle: their bows are built of chitin and bone, they only eat meat—including people, for the Meat Mandate within the Green Pact dictates that the Bosmer must devour those enemies that they fell in battle—and any needed wood is imported from foreign forests.

Due to the Green Pact, ships such as those of men cannot be constructed with local materials. The Bosmer may, and do, sail ships built of imported wood, but the sole use of foreign ships and local ships built of imported materials would simply be inefficient. Ships built of insect materials, such as those of the Dunmer (Dark Elves) and Maormer (Sea Elves), are out of the question as well, for the ships of both races do include some small quantity of wood in their design, and such huge insects as are needed are not native to Valenwood. Even the legendary ships of the Altmer (High Elves), built of crystal, light, and aetheric fire, are unsuitable, for although those ships do not put plant materials to use, Bosmeri mages capable of constructing such craft are few and far between.

The Bosmer are spared the fate of naval mediocrity by the Maritime Provision, a little known note within the Green Pact. Thaewen, a renowned Bosmeri historian residing in the Imperial City, states:

“When Y’ffre and the proto-Bosmer negotiated the Green Pact, the proto-Bosmer insisted that a provision of some sort must be made for sailing craft; to stand on its own, the nation of Valenwood would need to defend itself both on land and at sea against its enemies. The Maormer threatened Valenwood’s coastline even then, and the proto-Bosmer knew that they would have to fight against them if Valenwood was to stand at all.

Y’ffre thought and thought and thought, and he had an idea. He told the the proto-Bosmer that he would give them trees that would grow ships like fruit. He made the trees so that the proto-Bosmer could defend themselves against the Maormer, travel easily throughout Valenwood with the aid of its waterways, take a piece of Valenwood with them even when they went to sea, and spread seeds of more mundane trees and plants wherever the ships went. These trees, the Rellyeis in my tongue, were one of Y’ffre’s many gifts to the Bosmer.”


**Growth Cycles and Other Details**

Whether genuinely given to the Bosmer by Y’ffre as a provision of the Green Pact or created by some magical prodigy forgotten by history, the trees which bear ships as fruit do indeed exist. These trees, known in Valenwood as the Rellyeis, have a very complex life cycle. A given Rellye begins its life as a sapling growing on a coastline or riverside, and in general, it is half as thick as a Bosmer’s arm length from the  moment it sprouts from the ground. During the first stage of its life, the tree simply grows, spreading its roots, widening its trunk, and extending its branches. It has been noted that the Rellyeis gradually tilt their trunks and reach their branches in the general direction of the nearest body of water, be it lake, river, or sea, hanging over the body of water in preparation for later stages in its life. The period of growth lasts anywhere from twenty to thirty years, depending on the conditions of the tree’s surrounding environment. The Rellye continues growing even after this initial period, of course, but there is a core difference between the first stage and the stages after, to be discussed in the next paragraph.

Once it is as thick as one and a half arm lengths, a given Rellye enters the second stage of its life, which generally lasts thirty to forty years. It begins to bear fruit. That is the core difference between the first stage and the later stages; in each of the later stages, the Rellye grows a variety of water faring vessels. In the second stage, the tree grows small boats, such as rowboats, canoes, faerings, shallops, etc. These boats are generally put to use in the rivers and lakes of Valenwood, and only rarely stored within seafaring vessels. The boats are truly a boon to the Bosmeri people, for the rivers are the country’s only infrastructure—though the first Aldmeri Dominion introduced extensive roads throughout Valenwood, the Bosmer made no effort to maintain them in the years following the Dominion’s collapse, and they allowed the roads to fall into disrepair. Unsurprisingly, considering the Bosmeri appreciation for individuality, not one boat is the same. Initially, enormous flowers grow on the tree, eventually wilting and producing the bulbous fruit set. Over a period of six months, the fruit set expands as a roughly spherical shape. The fruit drops into the water, still green. Over a shorter period of three months, the fruit unfurls into the shape of a boat and grows bark. The boat is then complete, though oars must be crafted separately, oftentimes out of bone. The boat is alive. It absorbs water via small, hairlike roots poking out of the hull, gathers oxygen via small lenticels within the boat, and requires occasional exposure to sunlight. 

At a thickness of two and a half arm lengths, the Rellye enters the third stage of its life, and begins growing significantly larger fruit. The process is much the same, with the exceptions that fewer fruit grow at any one time than in the second stage, that each fruit grows for a year, sometimes two, and that each fruit bears a stem and leaf which protrude together from a small opening near the crown. Later, as the fruit unfurls in the water over a period of eight to twelve months, the stem is shed and the leaf grows into a sail. The product is a small ship, ready to sail. Like the ships of the second stage, each ship is different. In fact, the ships grown in the third and fourth stages are especially different, for they are particularly complex, at least in comparison to the relatively simple second stage fruit. Because each ship is different, a sailor cannot leave one ship and sail another as well as the first. With a new ship, much of a sailor’s old knowledge is useless, for the quirks, flaws, and intricacies of one ship are most often drastically different from those of another. However, despite their differences, the third stage fruit generally share the following characteristics: the ship’s rigging is of vines and roots, the rooms below deck are as the locules of a fruit, and there is no anchor, for instead of using an anchor, the ships extend the thin roots of the hull until they grip at the seafloor below. The ships can be put to use at sea in spite of salt water, for they employ a powerful filtration system akin to that of mangrove trees. Some small quantity of salt does enter the plant, but the salt is evacuated through the sail-leaf. The sailors of the ship must sweep the salt crystals from the sail daily. The ship even allows the sailors to put its water to use; the ship absorbs a great excess of water when the stores of the sailors are low, and sweats as much water as it can into a specified locule somewhere within the ship. Boats from the second stage are occasionally taken aboard the vessels from the third and fourth stages, and are stored within said locule. The boats of the second stage have very poor salt filtration systems, and are thus put at risk when used at sea.

After at least half a century of growth in the third stage, the Rellye enters the fourth, with a trunk thicker than four arm lengths. The fundamentals are, again, all the same, but everything is larger and takes longer. The fruit grow for as long as five years and unfurl within three. And, at this point, only one fruit grows upon the Rellye at a time. The products of this stage are equivalent to the products of the third stage, except greater in size. The ships produced in this stage are frigates, galleons, wide-bellied trading ships, and other such grand vessels. When a ship of the fourth stage drops off of its Rellye, the tree’s shipwrights—who tend to the bodies and fruits of the Rellyeis, and live in dwellings which cling to the trunks and branches of older Rellyeis, like the dwellings upon the famous walking city of Falinesti—celebrate for days and sometimes weeks on end, partaking in races down their river or around their lake and guiding the floating fourth stage fruit to ideal unfurling growns. At the time, the particulars of the final product, from the general shape to the specific quirks, are a complete unknown. As such, the shipwrights never know whether a fruit will be sea worthy or not. Indeed, complex as they are, the third and fourth stage ships are known for defects. The defective ships function well enough as plants, but are inoperable as ships. Such ships are most often either relegated to use as fishing platforms, or abandoned at sea to spread the seeds of trees other than the Rellyeis to other lands, as described in Thaewen’s earlier statement. During their celebrations following the fall of a fourth stage fruit, the shipwrights pray and dance such that the ship will grow to sail well, hoping to stave off defects with the power of tradition and Divine favor. After all, is a fourth stage ship grows to be defective, around eight years of development will have been spent without reward.

The Bosmeri shipwrights most often plant Rellyeis—through some secret ritual with inexplicably found seeds—along riversides and lake shores, and in consideration for the second stage boats and their poor salt filtration systems, they are only rarely planted along Valenwood’s coastline. The chosen locations are always accessible by boats and ships of all sizes, for the ships of the third and fourth stages must be able to leave the rivers and lakes in which they unfurl. Occasionally, either due to poor planning or changes in river flow, some of the products of the Rellyeis are trapped within their lakes or rivers. Such trapped ships can only be pushed to shore or left to float.

**Maritime Implications**

Despite the saying, “[a rare or uncommon object, product, or other commodity] doesn’t grow on trees”—for example, “Daedric armor doesn’t grow on trees”—and the fact that Bosmeri ships literally grow on trees, the Bosmer are not known for maritime superiority or an excess of seafaring vessels. Without consideration of the Rellyeis, the cause of their naval weakness would seem obvious; building a fleet solely of imported wood would be a nearly impossible endeavor. With consideration of the Rellyeis, the cause is less sure. The difficulty the Bosmer have with the concepts of military hierarchy and organization and the like (such as that within a fleet or a navy), the lack of a strong centralized government within Valenwood, and the rarity, slow production rate, imperfect products, and occasional outright defective products of the Rellyeis are all contributing factors. To be frank, the best of Bosmeri fleets could never hope to match the best of Imperial fleets or Altmeri fleets, and certainly not the best of Maormeri fleets.

There has only ever been one exception to that rule of Valenwood’s maritime weakness. As dictated by Thaewen, the Bosmer historian referenced in an earlier section:

“As with many great exceptions in Bosmeri history, the one exception to Valenwood’s historical naval weakness occurred under Haymon Camoran, the Camoran Usurper. As his influence spread throughout and ultimately suffused Valenwood, Haymon pushed the Rellyeis to produce better ships, faster. He disregarded uniqueness and promoted efficiency, and as a whole he labored to ensure that he would have the fleet necessary to fight against the Empire in his march of conquest.

The crowning jewel of Haymon’s fleet was the *Water Lily*, an absolutely massive ship built of four: Haymon bound four stage four ships on top of one another in such a way that they grew into one another and became a single entity. The result, a four-decked ship of incredible proportions, became Haymon’s mansion and castle at sea. Within, the *Water Lily* was a veritable labyrinth of locules and passageways. Haymon ultimately rode the *Water Lily* to the Battle of Firewaves in the Iliac Bay, where it was set alight, burned to cinders, and lost at the bottom of the Bay. The Breton forces in the naval battle had put fire to heavy use, for it was—and still is—a powerful weapon in combating Bosmeri ships.

The Rellyeis, of course, do not usually produce ships more urgently on the whim of a monarch, and their ships do not usually grow into one another. The Rellyeis are ‘just’ trees, after all, and the ships, as compared to mundane fruit such as apples, normally do not grow after they have dropped from their respective Rellyeis. Haymon Camoran’s methods behind the construction of his fleet are uncertain. Pro-Haymon sources claim that he conferred with the Rellyeis, or with the Spriggans, or even with Y’ffre himself. Some sources even indicate that he sang to or roared at the Rellyeis with some forgotten art of magic, and after he did so, the production cycles of the Rellyeis accelerated, and the ships he bound grew into one another. Anti-Haymon sources—of which there were many, after his death—claim that he hired a Telvanni wizard to push the Rellyeis, by employing the same magical techniques that the Telvanni use to grow their mushroom towers. Such an act would be a terrible crime, of course, flying in the face of the Green Pact. Though Y’ffre granted the Bosmer permission to benefit from the Rellyeis, he did not grant the Bosmer permission to change them, to warp them.

In the end, the accelerated Rellyeis were all destroyed. After Haymon’s death during the Battle of Firewaves, the Imperial navy sailed throughout Valenwood’s waterways and destroyed every Rellye they could find, so that the Bosmer could not build a new navy every decade as Haymon had. The only survivors were those Rellyeis which lay in backwater ponds and inaccessible tributaries. The Rellyeis have been purged in such a manner several times throughout history. Most often, the Maormer were the perpetrators. The last purge as perpetrated by the Maormer occurred during the Interregnum; more specifically, it occurred during the reign of the Altmer King Hidellith, roughly one hundred years before his death. It should be noted that even upon his death, the Rellyeis had barely recovered, and that they would not recover fully until yet another hundred years had passed. As the Maormeri fleet departed from Valenwood, its dark work done, an Altmeri fleet followed that of the Maormer to Pyandonea, the noted battle that lent Tamriel its only account of the alien land.”",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1361567603.0,,,True,t3_177t6t,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/177t6t/treatise_on_bosmeri_ships/,

Now I'm no expert, but what I've gathered from related topics on here, the Dragonborn trailer, and in-game sources is that the Dragon Empire could/would have stretched at least as far as Solsthiem, and it's possible that the Dunmer there would have had their own Dragon Priests ruling over them.

What I'm unsure of is whether it's possible for one of Solsthiem's priests to have been Konahriik.  Everything I know says that the nine Dragon Priests as we know them from Skyrim (Konahriik included) would have ruled only in Skyrim, and any priests in Solsthiem would come from Solsthiem.  My doubt comes from my own lack of definite sources for this information though; it's all conjecture on my part.

There wasn't any real meat behind it and it was basically a compilation of simple and obvious points.  So instead of boring you I've decided to replace it for an assortment of my favourite and (hopefully) most interesting observations.*


**Falmer language**

When comparing Falmeris to Ayleidoon one can see many similarities. Words such as ""ye"" (and), ""buro(i)"" (slaves), ""gandra"" (gifts)  and many more share the same meaning in both Falmeris and Ayleidoon. This can also be seen in the names of Falmer and Ayleids:

Ayleid - Umaril, Celethelel, Tjurhane

Falmer - Gelebor, Celegriath, Vyrthur

Therefore if the language is similar we can go further and attest that their culture and origins are similar. If so then I'd go and say that the Falmer are actually the Northern subgroup of the larger Ayleid culture. From this we can extract that the Falmer had a similar if not exact replica of the Ayleid pantheon with the same amount of reverence for Magnus, Auri-el and Aetherius. Whether this reverence continued on to Meridia and other Daedra or whether or not the Falmer shared the same passion for torture and enslavery, I am not sure.

**Dwemer language**

Dwemeris is the most alien of the languages of Tamriel. It's spellings and it's names are different to any other language of Tamriel and it's connection to Aldmeris is faint. Names such as Kagrenac, Dumac and Nchunak are for more harsh than the average soft Mer name and placenames such as far more so. Each Dwemer stronghold or city seems to share a part of their name with another which hints at a common name or word between strongholds. Examples of this include the stronghold of Mzuleft in Vvardenfell and Mzulft in Skyrim and the city of Arkngthand in Morrowind and Arkngthamz in Skyrim.

The reason for such a language is unknown but I conclude in saying that the language was a construct of the Dwemer just like everything else in their society. The Dwemer probably found a problem with Aldmeris and so built a new and better one just like they did with their animinculi.

**Tamrielic language tree**

[Here](http://notepad.cc/share/JFjWzEVk2M) is a language tree that I created in order to show the connections between all the various languages of Tamriel. Unfortunately I could not find a way to place Ta'Agra or Yoku within the tree but to all those wondering they come under Ehlnofex, both individually.

However, I wanted to do this to immerse myself in Dwemer and Falmer script, so I figured I'd at least post it here. Most of this is useless unless you can read Dwemer anyway, but I'll provide a *rough* translation at the end.

""**chun thuamer arkngd chend duathand, th ahvardn btham. amz thuamer ahrkanch kemelmzulchond aka mora, th thuangz ahrk, th duum melz thuabtharng, th kanthaln duabcharn mzin thuastur, btharumz thuamer zel. abakch duumarkng tuathumz amakai, th abakch avatheled kagr tuamkingth mzan. du chal fahl ngark, che du fahl bthun ur. du chal fahl ngalft, che du bthun ur. du abak chal thu abazun nchur duabthar, nchul duanchard. th ur thuanchuth irknd, ur irkngth eftardn, thunch fahlz. bthun abak dua mzual th nchuan duarkng, chun fahlbthar thuanchardch anum ralz, th eftar thuachendraldch kagren thua vanchningth.**""

I will not even pretend to know what that means. I postulate, since all meric languages came from Aldmeri, ""mer"" appears to be a common word, leading me to conclude that ""thuamer"" may have been the Dwemer word for Snow Elf. Furthermore, ""aka"" is a very specific word that is almost always associated with dragons. Seeing it next to ""mora"" denotes that (if mora is indeed a common meric word) it is referring to ""dragon"" and ""Forest"", perhaps a reference to the Nords of Atmora, who, with the roaring voices of dragons drove the Falmer deep underground to trust themselves into the twisted mercy of the Dwemer.

Some random words that stuck out because they reminded me of things were: ""irkngth"", ""fahlbthar"", and ""kagren"". Irkngth and Fahlbthar stuck out because they're similar to the names of two Dwemer ruins in Skyrim, Irkingthad and Raldbthar, and Kagren because it's most of Kagrenac's name. 

On to the Falmeri portion. I bolded the words we can translate with some degree of accuracy and left the untranslatable words unbolded.

""**ye sa sou meldi** *calne* **tarn va molagnensaliye** *trumbi* **nou bala** *ilpen* **av sou meldi** *nagaiale* **as** *guntumnia spantelepelaelia* **arani morae ye sou** *liebali racurane* **ye nu** *rautane sye* **ye nu** *hautalle* **nou buroi** *gune* **sou** *gravuloi* **sa** *metane sye garlis frey* **as** *gondra doemera* **tarcel lane sou agea** *silya* **nu** *hecta* **sou arcten** *rias* **nu** *nemalanta ge* **nu** *hecta* **sou** *epe* **gandra** *rias* **ne** *nemelauta ge* **nu** *frey sepe sye* **arcta varlor** *denai cullei noue staneiaye* **ry sou** *alasil auta* **ry loria** *shenta* **abagaiavoy malautavoy** *fey* **nou** *darre* **ye** *alata rou* **malae asma** *maraga* **sou anyamis av** *serven* **ye** *getheng* **sou** *wend riarilia vey emeratu* **sou oia** *besia.*""

Now, one thing that should stick out for anyone who's big into the Ayleid culture is that a *ton* of the Falmeri text has meaning in Ayleidoon. So, viewing that in light, we can translate a good bit of the Falmer text.

""**and so your driven ... pass in our halls of fire ... our power ... of your driven ... by ... ... kings of the wood and your (...-stones, or untranslatable) ... and you ... ... and you ... our slaves ... your ... so ... ... ... ... by ... ... woods of ... (time-never, perhaps never a time?) your (lore or wisdom) ... you ... you (acknowledgement, most likely acknowledge) ... you ... ... ... ... you ... gifts ... you ... ... you ... ... ... acknowledge cast-dark ... ... ... ... as you ... ... as darkness ... I do not fear the (High-..., or untranslatable) ... our ... and ... ... high by what ... your life of ... and ... your ... ... ... ... your eternal ...**

Now we leave what leave what little certitude we had and stray into conjecture. 

IF both the Dwemer script and the Falmer script have the same meaning in two different languages, it's fair to say that it was written by the Dwemer. It would appear to be written after the Dwemer enslaved the Falmer, and it has a very ""history to the victors"" feeling to it.

It appears to describe the fall of the Falmer Empire, how the Nords (kings of the wood, aka-mora) drove the Snow Elves (thuamer) underground, to the ""halls of fire"" belonging to the Dwemer, where the Dwemer recount their enslaving of the Falmer. It specifically mentions ""acknowledge"" and ""dark"" several times, leading me to believe that the latter half is the story of the Dwemer forcing the Falmer into slavery by their blindness, or forcing their blindness upon them. The Dwemer brag a bit at the end, calling themselves ""eternal"", perhaps ""eternal masters"". 

It's always baffled me why this Rosetta Stone exists, until now. The Dwemer wrote this, and I would bet they wrote others like it, to remind the Falmer of how they got into this state. The lower of the two scripts is the stylized and beautiful Falmeri script, easily recognizable due to the intricacies of each letter. Falmer who passed by could likely read it as braille, which also explains why the Falmeri portion of the text reads like someone telling someone ""this is your lot in life"". The use of ""you"" and ""your"" is incredibly telling, and shows just how sadistic the Dwemer could be. That was rubbing moon sugar into an open wound, if you will. It's no wonder the Betrayed rebelled and hate all living things now. If I had to change one of my previous guesses, I would change ""thua"" to mean ""you"" or ""your"", because it seems to be saying ""you elves got defeated, now you are our slaves, we are your eternal masters"" and so on. I'd also hazard a guess that ""kagren"" means ""master"" simply from the context of the piece.

* To start some simple cosmological questions. Just trying to sort the information in my head.

As far as I understand Aurbis is everything in the Godhead.

Mundus is the plane Nirn (the planet Tamriel is on) exists on.

Mundus, unlike the other 'planets' in the 'sky' is not infinite. The other 'planets' are actually the infinite planes of each of the divines as far as I understand.

The 'sky' (or space) is actually Oblivion which in turn encompasses us from Aetherius

Now:

* Sovngarde is in Aetherius yet it is ruled by Shor (Lorkhan). So why isn't it a 'planet' floating in Oblivion?

* Where are the Daedric planes? Do they have 'planets' too?

* I read somewhere that the Aldmeri Dominion are trying to destroy all the towers to become godlike. But before them mer were building towers to ascend to god-hood. This confuses me.

* Alduin eats the world starting a new Kapla. Does he eat Mundus? Or just Nirn? Did he decide to just rule the Nords for a while before he would eat them? Why does Alduin do this? Is it all borked now because the Dragonborn killed him? Or will Alduin return to do his thing?

* What happens if all the Pillars are destroyed/de-activated?

* Do pillars have any other effect apart from tethering Nirn.

* What do they tether Nirn to?

* What is the eye of the Magnus? Is it actually a space robot? If it is does that mean this Kapla is super long because civilization managed to get into space?

* What would this space robot mine if there isn't actually anything in 'space'?

* Why do some consider Pelinal a cyborg?

These are my questions. Please feel free to answer as many as you can. I am also very open to being linked to places I can learn my answers for myself. Also bonus points to someone who can elaborate on the Dreamsleeve.

Public readings will have the first edition copy of the Mysterium Xarxes displayed and readings will be read by famous voices of Divayth Fyr, Lucien Lachance, and Fargoth.
_______________________________________________________________

The infamous book, The Mysterium Xarxes, is a wretched piece of literature. Written by the prince of destruction, the book is riddled with daedric script and within those scripts hold riddles and encantations themselves. Some ask what allowed Mancar Camoran to teleport to his paradise for safety from the blades during the Oblivion crisis. At first my thoughts were, ""it's obviously the text that opened the portal."" However, a rough translation and interpretation has led me to believe other wise. It seems that the text themselves don't just give power, but maybe summons it.

[The first page of the Divine forsaken book](http://images.uesp.net/e/e0/Mysterium_Xarxes_P1.jpg) displays the infamous 'O' in the center of a circle surrounded by daedric script. The script that follow the axis of the circles edge read as so:

*For lord Dagon Forever reborn in blood and fire from the waters of Oblivion*

Now, there is no specific iteration of portals to paradise. This seems to just serve as the main excerpt for giving thanks to Dagon. Like all daedric worship, it is important to remember what please the princes, lest you displease them. Maybe this script is to bring Dagon's focus on you and place interest in your current affairs/goals.

The left text holds itself in a wrangled mess, this translation can be as useful as conjecture:

*When I walo the earth again thef_a ith fulamong ou_sha_llre*

This is when we can deduce that this is written from Dagon's point of view. It lacks proper grammar along with actual words. Though barely translatable, the passage seems to say ""when I wallow the earth again the faithful among you shall rises/return/rebel"". It seems that Dagon's plans for the Oblivion crisis were thought out well in advance. This seems to bring the conclusion that Camoran maybe did not create the Paradise himself or place into effect the events of the crisis, but rather Dagon was waiting for an appropriate candidate to fulfill it.

The writings on the right go as so:

*above all other mortals forever. Ceiveour reward tobeset*

Now this is a little tricky. The first part is distinguishable and gives us a clear statement. The second, however, eludes me along with other scholars. What I may deduce from the secondphrase can be a number of things.

* the roht in forever is carried in into the beginning, an ekhem is left out but we get ""receiveour"" or ""receive our""

* with that in mind we get, ""receive our reward to beset"" as in to receive a lavished or archaic (as what beset seems most nearly mean in this sentence).

* also, ""receive our reward to be set"" as a sign to say a reward is to be given, but the treasures of it are still up to debate.

In the end we conclude the statement to be, ""above all other mortals forever receive our reward to beset/to be set.""

The final statement states:

*As for the rest  the weak shall cast down the might   Shall trem* [ *sic* ]

This is the final elusive statement of the first page to Dagon's prophecy/summoning rites. One can assume that might is actually suppose to translate as mighty (Y is not used in common daedric script and it's presence is assumed by the spacing). The last word may potentially be tremble, Dagon's literature capabilities are well known to be sub-par and he may have accidentally run out room when writing the Xarxes. But we infer that the weak ate his followers (weak in terms of power and control of Tamriel) and the mighty is the empire (holding control of all of Tamriel).

I do hope this is a good translation to run on. My lore on Dagon still has a few wholes in it and might very well have affected the text in a negative way.

Ostensibly, Ulfric was gagged to prevent him from using the voice, when he was bound and due for execution. Okay, I can understand that.

But what of the ancient Nordic Tongues, who the histories say went about gagged and writing on chalk boards because their voices were two powerful to speak? And also the esteemed Greybeards, of whom Arngeir is the only one with sufficient mastery of the Voice to speak without blowing stuff away.


This leads into my question: My understanding of the Voice, has always been that it is a Voice only magic (witness how wards can negate it) which is entirely reliant on speaking 1-3 words of power in the Draconic language for it to function. I.e., saying FUS RO DAH will trigger a wave of unstoppable force, but under this model, saying ""PLEASE PASS THE MAMMOTH CHEESE"" shouldn't trigger an automatic clearing of the dinner table at Heljarchen. 

That being said, why did the ancient Tongues go around gagged? Was the ancient lingua natura of the Nords Dragonic language? Obviously, it wasn't modern Tamrielic, which was taken from the Aldmer. And if not, did they speak their own proto-nordic language? 

And if they did, why should they need to be gagged if they are not speaking any of the words of Power? The histories indicate that any sort of speaking on the part of the most powerful ancient Tongues resulted in mass destruction. That is certainly understandable if their native language was some form of Draconic. But, if it wasn't, then why the gags? And furthermore, why do the rest of the Greybeards not speak in Tamrielic, as does say, Ulfric?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Dwemer,True,t3_147fo7,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/147fo7/on_ancient_nord_language_and_the_gagging_of_the/,

EDIT: The community has spoken. Weekly it is.

Welcome, Scholars, to this week's Community thread! There is a *lot* to talk about today, so sit down, take some time to read the entire thing, and do take the time to congratulate our new moderator!

---

It's been a great week- lots of very interesting threads and good discussions, such as [Anonymous_Mononymous's ""The land bled with ghosts and deepset holes unto cold harbors""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11ibmj/the_land_bled_with_ghosts_and_deepset_holes_unto/), [ThunderBadeger's The Statue in the Chantry](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11k1hl/the_statue_in_the_chantry_dawnguard_spoilers/), and of course Regalnerd's [The Time God Conspiracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11iqga/the_time_god_conspiracy/). We also gained 83 new scholars, so if you are new *please* go ahead and read the New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit and the FAQ, both of which can be found on the sidebar.

It's also been a very busy week for us moderators. Prince-of-Plots, Starved, and I have all been doing our best getting ready for a big change in the subreddit, that actually very shortly about to start.

The subreddit is about to get a whole new look, following the great design created and suggested by Boose77. We're also going to have a new announcement bar, new sidebar (which you certainly should read), 3 all new flairs, and more excitingly an *IRC Channel*- thanks to Abhorsen469!


Hope you like all those new changes! Starved and Prince-of-Plots have worked very hard to create this new design, so make sure to thank those guys, as well as Boose77 and Abhorsen469 for helping design the layout and create the IRC channel.

With that all good and done, I know you all want to know who the new moderator is, so, here are the results:

---

The voting was very, very close. We had plenty of great scholars run for moderator, including Anonymous_Mononymous, b-rad-oleary, Voryn, and OrneryCretin.

The two most popular nominees were Regalnerd and Lilrhys- which both got much support from the other scholars. After a final tallying of the vote, as well as some discussion between the mods, we have decided on a new moderator.

Please, everyone, congratulate ***Lilrhys*** for his new role as moderator of our subreddit.

I and the rest of the moderation team would like to welcome Lilrhys into the Elder Council, wishing he will serve the subreddit well.

---

So that is pretty much it for what I have to say. New scholars remember to read the New scholar's guide and the FAQ, and everyone please congratulate Lilrhys for his new role. 

When the new design and subreddit improvements are put into place go ahead and give us any feedback you might have about the new design, flairs, IRC channel, etc.

I'm sorry for not having a scholar of the week in the last two community threads, and for the weirdness of the last two weeks- we are simply going through a period of change and so stuff gets a little confusing. Hopefully in the next community thread things will go back to normal and we can all go ahead with our lives. I have been thinking a bit about the frequency of these threads, and I thought perhaps I post these too frequently to give way for enough actually lore-related posts. So please tell me if you think I should decrease the frequency of the community threads. Would you guys rather have these be posted bi-weekly? Monthly? Or stay weekly?

That's really all I have to ask of you. I've already repeated what you are supposed to do in the comments a few times too many, so do that- as well as comment on anything really. You know that the only rule of community threads is that there are no rules (paradox, much?). If you have fanart, post it, if you have suggestions, say'em, go ahead and do whatever. 

Keep on postin' and most of all have a great weekend!

* Check my lore.  We don't know where the Skyforge came from, so I'm making that part up, but is the lore which we do know consistent?
* Do my cryptic references to historical events and the gods make sense?
* Do you like it or, as I'm sure someone is bound to say, does it suck?

---------------------------------------------------

**EDIT III: I've made changes to the lyrics.  The events take place just after the flight of the Aedra.  Kyne will play a role.  I've kept Cold Iron as a male and am debating whether to make the Sun female or gender-neutral.  I'm not sure if I'm going to stay that way, but I just like the male doing the chasing of the female, even if the sun isn't really female.  As it will turn out, what Cold Iron truly loves is the light of Aetherius, and it will be the joining with that light that will create the Skyforge and the first Skyforge Steel.  Really, the first steel of any kind.  True-steel.  All other steel is a copy of True-steel.  In addition, this will explain why the elves fear the Skyforge.  It is connected with Kyne, the widow of Shor, the enemy of elves and friend of men.**

--------------------------------------------------

Here's what I have so far:

* Brave warrior men, both fierce and fell
* Bold women, wild and free
* Please lend this lonely (wand'ring) bard your ear
* For one brief span and you shall hear
* Of how, upon an elder year
* The Skyforge came to be
* **'Ere Tiber Septim found the voice**
* **To bring men in one fold**
* **'Ere Ysgramor, on ocean swell**
* **Returned to Northern Tamriel**
* **With full 500 warriors fell**
* **The Skyforge, yet, was old.**
* When Massa and Secunda danced
* On heaven's new-formed bier
* When men were born and Aedra fled
* From newborn Nirn, by Magnus led
* And heartless, broken, Shor left dead,
* The Skyforge, yet, was here.
* **In those first days the world was wild**
* **The throes of Nirn's new birth**
* **When moonstone dripped on Tamriel**
* **And under ashen Vvardenfell**
* **Glass and Ebon god's-blood dwelled**
* **Cold Iron walked the earth**
* Cold Iron, simple as the sea
* And common as the grass
* Cold Iron, old when Nirn was new
* Cold Iron, clad in grayish hue
* More steadfast, stalwart, staid and true
* .Than ebony or glass.
* **How long Cold Iron roamed the dark**
* **As untold eons fly**
* **Until, one day, upon a whim**
* **The urge to look up came to him**
* **And up looked Iron's face most grim**
* **To gaze into the sky.**
* And there, by clouds attended sat
* The Sun upon her throne
* Her face, with white-hot kindness gleamed
* And to the earth descended beams
* Of blessing flowing forth in streams
* Upon the earth, his home.
* **He stood there, dazed, until her rays**
* **Descended into night**
* **And thinking her forever gone**
* **Not knowing of the coming dawn**
* **Cold Iron mourned until the morn**
* **The dying of the light**
* But Light returned, the morning burned
* The Sun returned to reign
* Relieved, he cast his gaze above
* And shouted his undying love
* 'Till coming evening made him move
* Into a darkened pain.
* **So, with the Dawn, he westward ran**
* **Thus following his heart**
* **'Till she, outrunning his slow pace**
* **Then sank again to even's place**
* **And Iron, turning eastward, raced**
* **That they might never part.**
* A widowed, hawk-eyed goddess watched
* Cold Iron's race wear on. 
* Each day the same worn path he'd tread
* Unheeding with an upturned head
* His footpath wore a riverbed
* Into the new-formed sod.  

The end of the story is that, finally, an eagle carries his message of love to the Sun (who had noticed him running back and forth every day).  She tells him (through the eagle) that they cannot meet or ever be together because it would kill him.  He replies that he would gladly die to meet her just once.  

Thus it is that, alone of all the metals of Nirn, Cold Iron met the sun and held fast for as long as he could.  And that was how the first Skyforged Steel was made, from his body.  And the place where they met became the Skyforge, with the eagle that carried their messages ever watching over their meeting place.

What if the coming of Y'ffre, as claimed by [the Precursor](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/y1itf/the_precursor/), was actually a reincarnation in the form of the player character? Perhaps the Precursor is told that this person will be born of a certain sign, there would be specific details/qualities to identify him or her with, etc. This would allow a player of any species and demographic to be accepted, something I think many in the lore community felt would be difficult as most races aren't exactly welcome in modern day Valenwood. The Bosmer would praise you, the Thalmor would tolerate you, and it would be such an incredible territory to explore. Increasing conflict between the Bosmer and Thalmor due to the player character could be a huge new stepping stone in the progression of the Empire's rebuilding. This idea can be taken even farther.

You could easily start out in the traditional prisoner role too. Thrown in the brig for some unknown reason when you are identified as the coming of Y'ffre and released.

I've been reading more and more about the towers, and some questions have popped up. I know the Thalmor take the Anuic belief of ""This existence thing was a mistake"" to extreme levels, and seem to want to ""unmake"" the world. I recall reading an oog source that seemed to suggest the Thalmor wish to annihilate the very idea of Man, and to also deactivate all the towers. 

One, if all the towers are deactivated, what happens? It's said that they're the only things keeping Mundus from floating off into Oblivion (I believe). If this happens, is it almost like the end of a kalpa, and things are recreated and go back to Convention 1.0? This seemed unlikely, as at that point Nirn had already been created and the races of men and mer would eventually spring up (or am I wrong about this?). 

Additionally, how would they be able to disable Ada-Mantia Tower? Since its stone is Convention, how would you ""deactivate"" convention? It seems popular to refer to the birth of the god of Talos to be Convention 2.0, thus reinforcing the Mundus by becoming a new Tower. Would eliminating the worship of Talos somehow weaken Convention 1.0 (I have no idea how this even makes sense to be honest!), allowing for the deactivation of the first tower? 

Or is it just really that the Thalmor are so fanatical that they're willing to try it anyway, even if their plan seems impossible to implement? It appears the Thalmor are in it for the long haul and seem to have everything planned out, so it seemed odd for them to entirely miss something like ""There's literally no way this plan can work!"". 

Lastly, and a bit off topic (but it didn't seem deserving of its own post), what's the deal with Vivec saying he was dancing on Azura's Tower in the Trial of Vivec? It seems like that choice of words couldn't have been an accident, but who knows with MK sometimes!

The following story was told to me by an Imga. Most of you have probably only heard about the Great Apes of Valenwood from their single mention in the Pocket Guide to the Empire. As someone who lived among them for quite sometime (I was forced to bathe twice-daily), I can tell you that the description in that book is horrendously flawed. The Imperial 'scholars' likely never left the safety of the Bosmer tree cities. It would explain their biased and libelous account. While it is true that many Imga revere and emulate the Altmer (including some of the embarrassing examples contained in the Pocket Guide), many more live by the old ways on the forest floor. Some of these traditionalists despise their tree-dweling shaved counterparts.

This story takes place after the Oblivion Crisis but before the Great War. I cannot testify to the truth of the tale, but I can assure the reader that the teller believed every word. I have reproduced his oral account as faithfully as possible. The edits I have made were minor and were done only for the sake of reader-comprehension. Still, I fear the reader will be missing out. The tale in its original form, the tale as told to me, came replete with excessive hand gestures, grunts of inflection, and at times even physical contact to bring me into the story. While I would like to think my writing is capable of jumping off the page, it will certainly pale in comparison to that.

**Chapter 1: Malcontent**
Watching, waiting, breathing. Muscles ache, hanging there. Eternity passed. Stomach growled; damned Daedra.

Rustling in the detritus; not far away. I see it slithering: spotted pit!gon! More waiting now, breath stopping. Silence is vital.

Directly below me. Falling now; toes grabbing, hands smashing. Watch the venom. Twist, pull, and break. Cruh!UNCH! I win.

Beat it on the tree, just to make sure. Uncle Glurp died from a snake bite. Thought he’d won. Forgot to make sure.

Fold it in half. Time to go home. Snake was heavy. Eighty pounds at least. Joff’s people would eat well.

Moving through the forest like the wind. Turning, twisting, jumping. Let the Bosmer have their trees. Imga rule the forest floor. Tree-folk can’t handle the dangers.

Home is just up ahead. No drumming coming from the clearing. Stupid Gorf. Keep playing, I tell him. Don’t stop ‘till I get back, I tell him. Would have to beat him now.

Then, new sounds. Shouting. And smells, a mix of dung and sweat and vomit. 

In my home!

Throw the snake first. Good effect. Leap in after it, through the trees. Land loudly. Spin, throw leaves, grunt. Pause. Beat the floor and beat my chest. Make them scared. Now stop.

Five Imperials I can see, more I can smell. A cart not far away. They do fear me; they grip their swords. All but one. Must be the commander.

“Why here!?” I demand. “This place belong to Duke Joff and Imga. No man-pigs.”

Puff out your chest. Show him you’re big.

“What did it say?” commander man-pig asks vomit-sack. “I can’t understand those monkey grunts. The shaved Imga in the trees are bad enough. These wild things though...”

Vomit-sack responds: “It says its name is Joff. It doesn’t want you here.”

“Ah, well that’s too bad,” man-pig makes its voice slow. “You pay taxes. We Empire. Emperor Mede. You understand?”

Anger boils. “No taxes! No Empire! Fuh!UHCK! Mede!”

Vomit-sack begins to translate.Commander Man-pig cuts him off:: “I got that part.” Makes voice slow again. “Right, Joff. Monkeys haven’t been paying taxes. Very bad. Everyone in Valenwood must pay taxes. Otherwise, bad things happen.”

Gorf must have argued. Explains shouting. Wouldn’t have to beat him. ‘Least not hard. “Duke Joff to you man-pig...”

Not listening. Man-pig waves its naked hands. Smelly creatures start to move. Rummaging through our things.

Rage smoulders. Kill them? Others hiding. Can smell more. Can't see more. None can escape. Army will follow. Must wait.

Man-pigs take mostly shinies. By Jiffer it's Dumb! Stupid dung-men. Ale. Mead. Wine. Rare skins. Finest drums in Tam!RUGH! Joff’s treasure is endless. Fools can have gold. Maybe taxes not so bad.

“The don’t have much sir,” vomit-sack reports. “But I think its enough.”

“Not for back taxes. Take the alcohol too, everything you can carry. The men can have it tonight.”

Man-pig looks at snake. It’d better not. Uglier than a shaved Imga it is.

“And take that snake. I’ve never seen one so big. That should be worth a fine price at market.”

Fury explodes! KILL THEM! No. Can’t. Must wait. 

**Chapter 2: The Great Awakening**

Walking now. Up, up, up it spirals. High into the trees. Time to find Mulch: thieves den. Fast-fingers know where to find man-pigs.

At the top. Bosmer everywhere. Annoying little things. Can’t help but trip on ‘um. Worse, man-pigs and vomit-sacks up here. Can taste the stench. Bosmer scurry out of the way. Dumb men don’t. Oughta throw ‘um over the edge.

Crossing bridges. Wood creaks and sways. Too heavy. Not made for Imga these. Stupid to live up here really. Too easy to fall. 

The detritus is soft and wet. Still, far enough down to turn you into mush. Saw it once. Nord ‘feller. Walking along bellow and then Suh!MUSH! Even stinkier when they’re goop. Best reason not to throw um. Stink up the forest.

Shaved-ones walk by. Little group. Looking at Joff like a man-pig. Dumb stupid Imga, those. No fur. Little swords. Joff would break them. Rocks much better. Can’t smash a skull with little-sword.

Bosmer singing nearby. Trying to convince the vines to be a house. Plants have been stubborn since the Daedra came. Jiffer taught the wood-folk to sing. Still, Voices too soft. Can’t say the words right. Imga do it right.

Here now. Mulch district. Stench not so bad. Man-pigs avoid this place. Quick little fingers find their pockets. Joff has no pockets. No worries.

Building up ahead. Beautiful really. Vines lock. Twist and hug. Making walls. Hard to tell where tree stops and house beings. Beautiful. Won’t tell them that.

Approach. Voices inside. Joff steps too loud. Voices stop. Enter. Only one person to see now.

“Ah, Joff,” little tree-walker says. “How can I help you? You run out of ale down there? Perhaps some hide to repair a drum?”

Joff ignores questions. “Duke Joff, little Ear-wain. Who here?”

“Hm...? Here? Why, just you and your good friend Erwaen.”

“Bah!RUNK!” Voice booms. Ear-wain steps back. “No lies little-one. Joff hears.”

Voice shaking: “Err...oh, that. Just a fellow from High Rock come to trade. I didn’t think it worth mentioning.”

Puff up chest. Show him you’re big. “It lies badly. Joff smells. No vomit. No dung. No sour sweat. Joff comes looking for advice. Willing to pay to find man-pig camp. Joff can’t trust you.” Leaving now. Find someone better.

“Wait!” Ear-wain calls out. “Do you mean to say you are asking for directions to the Imperial fort?”

Stopping. “Joff has said. Man-pigs insult Duke Joff. Pay-back.”

Magic. Out of nowhere. Out of the walls. Been here the whole time. Altmer fellow. Fancy robe. Shiny hood.

Nod to him. Won’t bow and grovel like the shaved-ones. Still. Altmer smell nice. 

Fancy-fellow comes over: “I think you and I can be of use to each other friend.” 

**Chapter 3: The Calm**

Heading home. Carrying free ale barrel. Payment for services. Dark forest. Careful not to drop it.

Near home, hear drumming. Good, no beatings. Need strength for tomorrow.

Close now. Just beyond the trees. Joff’s great land before him. Dozens mighty Imga. Many kids too. Drummers drum and beat on trees. Making noise. Let the world know mighty Joff is gone. Help mighty Joff find his way home.

Enter clearing. Say nothing. Do nothing. Wait. Slowly, drumming begins to quiet. Gorf is last one to stop. Finally, dumb Gorf sees Joff. Silence.

Walk up to him. Get in his face. Let him know he’s small. Breathe hard. Puff out lips. Finally, Gorf speaks:

“What happen?”

Slap him hard. No questions. Let him turn his face back. Slap him again. Never speak first. Joff explains:

“We go to war.”

Moment of silence. Just one. Then, drumming begins again. Different this time. Frantic. Passionate. Frenzied.

Joff slams down ale barrel. Pop the top. Others grab more barrels. Time to get ready. Chug the ale. Start the dance. Battle dance.

Beat your chest. Beat the ground. Hoot. Grunt. Holler. Joff runs circle around camp. Everyone stays back. Stop in front of Gorf again. Dare him. Gorf does nothing. 

Move to the center. Twirl. Others join the dance now. Beat begins to change. Other noisemakers join. The shakers. The clangers. Time to start the speech:

“Im!GUH!”

The call rings back, “Im!GUH!”

“Cru!USH! Sma!ASH! break and burn. That’s the way our enemies learn. Im!GUH! strong. Im!GUH! quick. Blood, blood, make it slick!”

Response: Hoots and hollers. Ready for war. Ready for blood. Ready to die. Beat changes once more. Find partners. More ale.

Gorf knows to stay put. Not allowed to dance. Joff grabs Irmuh, favorite dance partner. Dance furiously. Change partners. Dance more. Change partners again. Soon, lost. Lost in rage. Lost in ecstasy. Lost in music. Lost in sleep. 

**Chapter 4: Hunger**

Up with the sun. Time to move out. Imga fly through the forest. Moving like wind. Hoots and hollers. Bang the trees. Bosmer move like rabbits. Quiet. Hiding. No one moves like Imga. Predators stay away.

Clearing ahead. Unnatural. Man-pigs cut down trees, long ago. Bosmer already there. Hundreds of ‘um. Just past the trees. Facing the fort. Mad. Sight of dead trees. Nothing worse for the wood-folk.

Howling and yelping. Hoping their screams cause fear. Not doing it right. Jiffer taught them the words. Joff knows he did. Uncle Brom told him so. They forgot the words. Or can’t say ‘um right. Weak voices. Soft tongues. Imga do it right.

Into the clearing. Move to the front. Face the Bosmer. Find the leader. Pound the ground. Just once. Puff out your chest. Now wait. Hand goes up, howling stops. Better. Leader mad, yelling. Angry. Ignore him. Joff faces the fort. Battle time.

“Rah!UHK!” 

Ground splits. Great scar. Walls crumble. Great hole. Man-pigs die. Great joy.

Moment pause. Bosmer silent, shocked. Joff doesn’t wait. Running now. Across the field. Arrows fly, both sides. One thing useful about the wood-folk. Arrows go farther than rocks, even with a good arm.

Through the hole. Imga follow. Bosmer right behind. More arrows. Magic sparks. Bright lights. Bodies fall, left and right. Enemy front and center. Making a wall. Stone wall gone. Flesh remains.

Grab the rocks. Bits of cement. Throw ‘um hard. Heads break. Other Imga help. Rocks and arrows batter man-pigs. Second wall breaks. Flesh not so strong as stone. Move in.

More man-pigs here. ‘Nother wall. Smaller this time. Most outside, fighting wood-folk. Arrows fly. This time, wrong side. Imga fall. Korb. Bart. Filp. Sadly, no Gorf. Blood rage begins. 

Joff charges. Others follow. Knock ‘um down. Beat their heads. Take their swords. Smash their limbs. Make ‘um mush.

Big ‘feller charges Joff. Raises sword. Gorf grabs from behind. Breaks neck. Joff fumes.

All gone now. No more man-pigs inside. Bosmer outside, still fighting. Only Imga. 

Down the stairs. Basement. Can’t go further. Big door. Locked. Imga beat it. Nothing. Gorf steps back. Runs. Throws himself on it. Nothing. Joff smiles. Thick wood. Won’t break. Sounds inside.

Joff speaks: “Move.” They move.

“Wool!OHD!”

Door shatters. Splinters fly. Frightened squeal. There he is. Commander Man-pig, gathering gold. 

Treasure room. Vast treasure. Not so vast as Joff’s of course. No drums. Mostly shinnies.

“Going?” Joff asks.

“Out of my way you dirty ape. I’ll kill you where you stand.” Voice shaking. Draws sword. 

Joff laughs: “Dance man-pig.” Others know to stay back.

Quick. Even in the metal skin. Moving left. Moving right. Twirls sword. Coming at me now, screaming.

Slap his head. He stumbles. Move in, ready to break him. He turns. Sword slashes. Cold steel bites. Joff bleeds. No matter. Imga feel no pain. 

Grab his arms. Twist. Sword falls, clattering on floor. Fear. Mixed with the smell of dung and sweat and vomit. Horrible things. Horrible smell. Deal with it. This is revenge. This is justice. This is necessary.

Move in close. Face to face. Breathe on him. “Fuh!UHCK! Taxes. Fuh!UHCK! Empire. Fuh!UHCK! Mede.”

“Fal!UHM!”

Flesh burns. Smell even worse now. Cooked man-pig worse than goopy man-pig. He screams. Now pull. Arms tear free. Still connected, but loose. Commander Man-pig dies.

Grunts of approval from behind. We’ve won. Not worried about the ones outside.

There, in the back. Behind the treasure, Joff’s snake. Take it. Now go home.

**Editors Addendum**

I came Valenwood to study the Imga after the end of the Great War. My visa from the Thalmor officially states that I am here for cultural and biological studies. Indeed that was my intention. Yet, what I have uncovered here is vastly more important and valuable to the scholarly world than simply correcting the inconsistencies of the First PGE would have been.

If the above tale is true, it would mean that the Imga were instrumental in the coup d'etat that expelled the Empire and its Bosmer sympathizers from Valenwood. Naturally, there is no mention of these events in Justianus Quntius’s popular title The Great War.

Like any good academic, I have attempted to corroborate this tale via cross-referencing. Imperial records were most unhelpful. There were no survivors from the massacre at Fort Moonmont, which I believe to be the Imperial Fort mentioned in Joff’s tale. The fact that not a single text in the Imperial Library mentions the Imga is unsurprising. They would have had no part in the political element of the coup. For Joff, what he did was an unnoteworthy act. He had no interest in the war of nations. He was simply righting a wrong that had been committed against him.

Thalmor sources would likely be equally unhelpful. Indeed, I haven’t even dared to ask. Inquiring into the political machinations of the Aldmeri Dominion is a good way to end up dead or disappeared.

My last hope was the Bosmer. Unfortunately, those who participated in the coup see it as a great victory for their kind. And they aren’t sharing the glory. My best piece of evidence is rather unconvincing. The Imga who told me this story, Joff, had a large scar across his chest. He had clearly been stuck by a sword. Admittedly, he could have received the scar in a number of other ways besides fighting the Commander of Fort Moonmont. 

Still, while I am unable to confirm this tale, I find it interesting for a number of reasons and I am inclined to believe it. Perhaps the most interesting thing to me, was Joff’s discussion of what seemed to be a type of shouting. I theorized that this could some sort of Imga thu’um. When I asked my Imga hosts to demonstrate, they only laughed. When I asked, how the power worked--is it a type of magic?--they seemed confused. The only response I got is that it is important to remember the names of things. ",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1364516131.0,,,True,t3_1b6jr7,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1b6jr7/tamrugh_revolution/,

**The First Page: History of Valenwood**

In 1E 0, Valenwood saw the dawn of recorded history when Eplear of the Camoran clan was crowned King of Valenwood and all Bosmer in the highest boughs of Falinesti. Eplear’s conquest and political creation of Valenwood, and unification of the disparate tribes and clans of the Bosmer is known as one of the greatest military feats in Tamriel’s history, and one that has never truly been repeated. 

King Eplear is fondly remembered by the Bosmer, and the Camoran Dynasty is highly thought of; under his reign Valenwood was prosperous and peaceful. Eplear not only welcomed those Nedes who fled from Cyrodiil throughout the reign of the Ayleids, but also those Ayleids who fled Cyrodiil following the Alessian Revolt. Eplear's hospitality could very well be the sole reason that any Ayleids survived the pogroms of the First Empire at all.

It was in 1E 340 that Valenwood first had true political contact with the ascendant Empire of the Cyrodiils, signing a trade treaty with Emperor Ami-El. This apparent harmony was not to last however, as the rise of the Alessian Order made amiable relations between man and mer steadily more difficult. In 1E 369, the dedicated Alessian King Borgas of Skyrim, last of the line of Ysgramor, was keen to demonstrate his piety and follow in the footsteps of the rulers of Cyrodiil and High Rock with his own war against the elves. To this somewhat questionable end, he marched to Cyrodiil to urge war against the Camorans’ Valenwood.

It seems likely that Borgas, with a mighty Nordic army at his back, expected little resistance from the unwarlike elves, but resistance he definitely met. It is unclear whether Borgas ever got as far as Valenwood, or if his chosen foes found him first, but records agree that Borgas and many of his men were slaughtered by the Bosmeri weapon of last resort, the Wild Hunt. 

However it happened, this action proved sufficient to safeguard Valenwood for several decades, and plunge Skyrim into fifty years of civil war with the loss of Ysgramor’s last heir. It also had the effect of dispelling the notion that the now-mature kingdom of the Bosmer would fall easily. It was not, however, the end of conflict with Empire, and even after the Alessian Order dissolved, skirmishes played out constantly along Valenwood’s borders. These battles became steadily more intense as Imperial forces, bolstered by Empress Herta’s Colovian acquisitions, pushed deeper and deeper into Bosmeri territory. Herta captured the province in 1E 2714, weakened as it was by the protracted conflict and the Thrassian Plague.

The Empire took quick and effective action to secure its gains and complete the emasculation of the Camoran Dynasty. Each of Valenwood’s greatest cities: Falinesti, Silvenar, Elden Root, Haven, Archen and Woodhearth, were granted independence, successfully breaking up the influential members of the Dynasty (most of whom were Treethanes of these cities) and appealing to the traditional, pre-Camoran tendency towards localised clans and tribes. This strategy ensured that even after the fall of the Second Empire in 2E 430, the Camorans could not repeat Eplear’s achievements and unite the now disparate Bosmer. With no strong leadership, the kingdoms of the Bosmer fell to war with each other, the Khajiit and the Colovians.

This situation continued unchecked until 2E 830, when northern tribes offered land to the Colovians in exchange for peace. Camoran Anxemes, one of the several claimants to Eplear’s then-defunct throne, invoked an obscure treaty (the validity of which has been disputed by contemporary and modern scholars) which lent stewardship of Valenwood to the Altmer in case of a dire threat to the kingdom’s integrity. The invasion of the Altmer in response forced back the Colovians and established the first Aldmeri Dominion, the most stable power in Tamriel until the Third Empire. Under the Dominion, Valenwood was ruled from Elden Root by an unpopular but pragmatically accepted coalition of Altmer and Bosmer known as the Thalmor (not to be confused with the modern Altmeri faction of the same name). It was at this time that the first (and only serious) attempt was made to “tame” Valenwood, with roads and infrastructure being built through the forest, resulting in an unprecedented (but short-lived) logistical efficiency in the Bosmeri homeland. 

Valenwood remained quietly prosperous under the Dominion until 2E 896 when, with the help of the Numidium, Tiber Septim completed his conquest of Tamriel and destroyed the Dominion. Once again the Bosmer tacitly adapted to life under a new master, the process aided by Septim’s wise decision to allow the Bosmer their Tribal Council and Camoran king, and Valenwood was at peace, a “trophy province” over the Empire’s hearth.

But of course, this was not to last. The Empire’s neglect bred resentment and disobedience in the Bosmer, and it was perhaps unsurprising when war broke out yet again in 3E 249. The Hart-King Haymon Camoran, better known as the Camoran Usurper, began a campaign to seize control of Valenwood and the Camoran throne, shrugging off his cousin and liege-lord Camoran Kaltos. The Usurper was ruthless and cruel, infamous for torturing captives and civilians, terrifying his enemies with bestial roars and summoned daedra, and allegedly raising the corpses of his enemies to fight for him, but many Bosmer welcomed his promise of independence from an increasingly unpopular Empire, and the same promise carried his armies (more likely comprised of Bosmer and Redguard mercenaries than the daedra and undead of the legends) north, out of Valenwood and as far as High Rock, where he was finally defeated by Camoran Kaltos and the Bretons under Baron Othrok at the Battle of Firewaves in 3E 267.

Following the failure of the Usurper’s revolt, Valenwood entered another period of decline. The Bosmer were demoralised and frightened by the horrors birthed in their homeland, and retreated from the cities in vast numbers, returning to their clanhouses and deepwood villages. This “regression”, and the decades following were dangerous indeed for Valenwood, and its neighbours began to see it as a wounded animal. In the days of the Imperial Simulacrum (3E 389 – 3E 399), Valenwood, once again neglected by the Empire, was an easy target for the armies of Summerset and Elsweyr. It lost significant chunks of land to both nations in a series of regional conflicts, most famously the Five Years War of 3E 394/5– 3E 399 and the War of the Blue Divide in 3E 397.

The exact starting point of the Five Years War is debated: the Bosmer claim it began in 3E 394 when Khajiiti bandits began attacking the timber caravans so essential to the Bosmer, while the Khajiit claim it was started by the Bosmer in the Slaughter of Torval, the Bosmer response to the bandit attacks. In any case, the war was a bloody one which ran until 3E 399 at the cost of many lives. The Bosmer were initially successful, taking full advantage of the sudden adoption by the Khajiit of alien tactics proposed by Nord advisors, but once the armies of Elsweyr returned to their traditional techniques, Bosmeri forces were pushed back into Valenwood and all the way over the Xylo River. A short-lived truce was signed in 3E 397, only to be broken the same year by the Khajiit, pressing their advantage by crossing the river and razing Bosmeri hamlets. As with most wars with the Bosmer, the Five Years War was ultimately ended by a Wild Hunt; this one began in the now-forgotten settlement of Vindisi. The Khajiit withdrew to the west bank of the Xylo, where they remained. 

The War of the Blue Divide was perhaps more surprising, pitching the Bosmer against their traditional allies, the Altmer. It began in 3E 397 and was named after the body of water that separated the combatants. The exact causes of the war are uncertain, but it is often traced to the aggressive expansion of the Altmeri-backed Parikh Tribe in south-eastern Valenwood. From the very beginning the war’s result was a foregone conclusion – the Altmer had not only far superior infrastructure and military organisation, but one of the mightiest navies in Tamriel, and in a war fought across an ocean, the Bosmer had little hope. The war was over by the end of the year, and while the Altmer never invaded mainland Valenwood, they were successful in seizing several coastal islands that have remained Altmeri possessions ever since.

By the time of the Oblivion Crisis, Valenwood was in its worst condition for centuries. Still reeling from its losses over the past few decades, its morale shattered, Valenwood had almost ceased to exist as a unified entity. The Tribal Council was all but dissolved, having not met since the War of the Blue Divide, and the individual Bosmeri clans and tribes identified with no greater entity than themselves. In 3E 429, the Falinesti tree rooted itself in the north of the province, sparking a brief panic among its inhabitants. The tree lived on however, despite remaining static, and so life in Falinesti continued, albeit vastly changed to accommodate the lack of a southward migration.

The next year Valenwood’s upheaval continued with scattered reports of a Wild Hunt (although no Bosmer could report seeing or hearing of a Hunt being initiated), and the appearance of the Precursor, a now famous prophet of the Bosmer. His teachings marked the first significant development in the Bosmeri religion since the Aldmer first settled in Valenwood, and he is revered almost as a saint even today.

Valenwood, the purported homeland of the infamous Mankar Camoran, was evidently not considered a major target by the Mythic Dawn Cult and was relatively unharmed by the Oblivion Crisis. Nonetheless, the period of instability from 4E 0 to 4E 28 fuelled the increasing sentiment of dissatisfaction and neglect among the Bosmer, and in 4E 29, a contingent of Thalmor agents and their Bosmer allies launched a coup against Imperial rule. With the Mede Empire in its infancy, and chaos reigning across the continent, the Imperial presence in Valenwood was skeletal, and Bosmer loyalists were quickly defeated. The secession of Valenwood from the Empire marked the creation of the Aldmeri Dominion and the severing of all contact with the Empire. Needless to say, from this point on, events in Valenwood are almost a total mystery, and will perhaps have to wait for future generations to transcribe.


**Wagons of Timber: Economy and the Green Pact**

To the uneducated eye, the engine of the Bosmeri economy would appear obvious. The one resource that Valenwood has in clear abundance is wood. The timber from the smallest and sickliest graht oak would fetch an attractive price in Cyrodiil or any other human province, and the forest is so dense and fast-growing that the Bosmer could reliably cut and sell enough timber for most of the continent. But thanks to the Green Pact, the Bosmer abhor the very idea of such exploitation, and so no large-scale tree-felling has ever taken place in Valenwood, despite the efforts of Colovians and Khajiiti at various points throughout the ages.

While they refuse absolutely to cut their own, the Bosmer do acknowledge the value of wood, particularly as a building material, and it is this that makes the economy of Valenwood truly bizarre. Instead of the province’s major export, timber, naturally its most abundant natural resource, is its greatest *import*. From the first trade treaty with the Empire in 1E 340 (and perhaps earlier), the Bosmer have imported wagonloads of timber from the rest of Tamriel, and often (given the rarity of carpenters in Valenwood) the personnel to make use of it. In fact, this market is so reliable that it is customary for merchants, whatever their wares, to bring a wagon of lumber with them to Valenwood, as it is almost guaranteed to fetch a high price. So important are these shipments that they have actually been at the heart of numerous conflicts over the course of history, most notably the Five Years War discussed in the previous section.

This system, of course, makes no economic sense, and as a result Valenwood is a far less wealthy province than it otherwise might be. If it weren’t for the simplistic and self-sufficient nature of their society and culture, the Boiche might be said to live in poverty, possessing few of the luxuries taken for granted in provinces like Cyrodiil.

It is Valenwood’s craftsmer, leatherworkers and bowyers who bring the most gold into the province, selling fine goods to travellers or to sailors leaving the ports of Haven and Southport. Men and mer alike appreciate the quality and artifice of these goods, and so they are a fairly reliable resource, somewhat comparable to traditional Nibenean ancestor silk. However popular these goods might be, they have never, with the possible exception of leather, been produced on a mass scale; they remain the preserve of small family workshops or collectives. This does increase the value of each sale, but of course also ensures that fewer sales are made.

Valenwood’s centres of wealth, then, are those cities where crafts and trade are most prominent, and where strangers are around to buy them. Silvenar has long been home to the province’s finest leatherworkers and master craftsmer, as well as being the seat of the Silvenar, and so there is a continuous stream of revenue into the city of sap. The ports of Haven, Southpoint and Woodhearth are also, naturally, economic powerhouses (relatively speaking) with the steady stream of foreigners and merchants ensuring a circulation of Bosmeri goods.

The idea of an “economy” is something of a strange one for the Bosmer; they appear to have very little interest in the accumulation of wealth or, in many cases, of plying any particular trade. What the Bosmer do acknowledge, however, is the practical importance of certain goods, particularly their foreign timber shipments. When the Bosmer initiate a war or enter negotiations over this wood, it is not because they seek to cultivate their economy, but because they seek to build houses, or docks, or other wooden constructions. True mercantile concerns as they would be defined in Cyrodiil or most other provinces appear to hold little sway over the Bosmer.


**The Triarchy of Valenwood: Government and Politics of the Bosmer**

Broadly speaking, the government of Valenwood consists of three main organs: the King of Valenwood, the Tribal Council, and the Silvenar. Each of these fulfils a separate function, although the less-than-rigorous design of the Bosmeri “state” means that there is often an overlap.

The King of Valenwood is a scion of the ancient Camoran Dynasty of King Eplear, and is appointed by heredity. The throne of the Camorans is in Falinesti, and it is for this reason more than any other that that city is considered the capital of Valenwood. Since Eplear’s time, the Dynasty has steadily increased in size to the point where it is almost a separate social class. In Valenwood, “nobility” and “Camoran” are all but synonymous, with the highest members of the family occupying the positions of King or Queen, and as Treethanes of the Dynasty (comparable to Nordic Jarls, each is “King” over one of Valenwood’s major cities, although only the Treethanes of Silvenar commonly use that title). The official role of the King of Valenwood is somewhat ill-defined, and depends greatly on the individual incumbent. Some Camoran monarchs, like Eplear himself, and several others (including, arguably, the infamous Usurper) have taken the reins in the fashion of a Cyrodiilic Emperor, or a King of Alinor, uniting their people and striving for a goal (for better or worse). The larger portion, however, have fulfilled a largely ceremonial role. The divided and decentralised nature of the Bosmer means that a king’s commands rarely extend far from his throne, but even when national pride is at its lowest, all but the worst of monarchs are typically regarded in the light of Eplear’s deeds, and considered special favourites of the Forest God.

The Tribal Council is, as the name suggests, a council of Valenwood’s most prominent tribal and clan chieftains. The Council meets irregularly, essentially whenever enough members are in favour of a meeting. They may be days apart, or years apart, and can happen in any city of Valenwood, although Falinesti is the most popular venue. It is perhaps this branch of the triarchy that has the most direct influence over the Bosmer, as decisions made by the Council (which can cover almost any topic) will be brought back to the tribes and clans by their chieftains, to whom most Bosmer owe loyalty. That is not to say, of course, that *every* chieftain is present in the Council – such a mass gathering would be impracticable – but typically the smaller clans will follow the lead of their closest (by geography or blood) tribe, and in this way the decisions of the Council diffuse across the province. 

Third, and most unusual, is the Silvenar. The Silvenar lives in a sumptuous palace in the city of the same name, and his (or “their”, as the Bosmeri terminology more typically goes) role is to represent the will of the Bosmer as a people, specifically in dealing with outsiders. Travellers wishing for special permissions, for instance to pass through wartime borders, or establish a settlement in Valenwood, must petition the Silvenar, typically in person. The decisions of the Silvenar will be happily acted upon by almost any Bosmer, and any deviation from them, or insult to the Silvenar, will be considered an insult to the Bosmeri people.

This perhaps is not extraordinary; many cultures have appointed people’s representatives, some of them as loyally followed as the Silvenar of Valenwood, but in actual fact, the Silvenar is quite unique. The Silvenar is the subject of a magical phenomenon never observed in any other context, whereby he actually embodies his people as a whole. When the Bosmer are powerful, or feel powerful, he will be large, muscular and strong. When many Bosmer have died, or they feel broken or defeated, he will be small and unimposing. When the Bosmer look kindly on a given group, he will friendly and accommodating to its members. In times of war he will display a powerful hatred for the enemy. His appearance and temperament can change overnight in the case of a significantly momentous event.

The phenomenon goes far deeper than physical appearance of course. Those who have met the Silvenar typically report being reminded of every Bosmer they have known, and of all their most powerful memories of Valenwood. Some critics have dismissed the powers of the Silvenar as good information and clever illusions, but few who meet him in person voice such opinions. The exact nature and history of the Silvenar and his powers are totally unknown; records of such a person are as old as the Bosmer, but the story of the first Silvenar is either unknown, or not shared with outsiders. It would appear that the secret of “creating” a Silvenar is still understood, at least to a practical degree, as a Silvenar lives only as long as any other Bosmer, at which point a new one is selected, often from the previous Silvenar’s family, but sometimes seemingly at random.

There is no true hierarchy in this triumvirate of governance; in many ways, they all must obey each other. The Silvenar represents the will of the people, and so the King and Council must (or would be wise to) follow his wishes, but by the same token, he must be loyal to his tribe, clan or king, as most Bosmer are. The King is ruler of all Valenwood, and so can, if he has the will and force of personality, make demands of his subjects, including the tribal chieftains. But he also must accept that these chieftains have their eyes and ears throughout the kingdom, far from Falinesti, and often know what is best. They in turn may be quite forceful in their recommendations to the King and even the Silvenar.

This system, while admirable in the voice it gives to the people, and the lengths it goes to in order to unify them, is far less efficient than more conventional means of government. The lack of ordered hierarchy or absolute head means that the King, Council and Silvenar can contradict each other’s rulings or attempt to lead Valenwood in different directions. In most situations, it is the Silvenar’s word that stands, but this is because his word invariably reflects the feelings of the people on a given issue, not because he has authority over the other branches of government. Elven critics commonly cite this inefficiency of governance as one of the reasons why the Bosmer have never ruled an empire, and of the three branches, it is typically only the Camorans who will dispute such claims. In any case, no concerted effort has *ever*, as far as records can show, been made to alter the system, and Bosmer on the whole seem to be quite happy with it, as with their inefficient but functional economy.

It is typically only when the power dynamic changes, and the triarchy ceases to be the sole power in Valenwood, that unrest comes about. The Bosmer do not appear to have any ingrained cultural disdain for incorporation into greater powers; they have been obedient subjects in every Empire of which they have been a part and, it would seem, in every Dominion. But they never seem to have shown true *loyalty* to these bodies. The first and foremost obligations of a Bosmer are to Y’ffre and his clan or tribe, and their loyalties will stretch as far up as the King of Valenwood, but seldom higher. If the Bosmer find a reason to strongly dislike the Empire that presides over them they will reliably become less faithful and obedient, and even go as far as to push for independence.

Most commonly, this grievance has been neglect. In 3E 349, it was Imperial neglect that in large part allowed the Camoran Usurper his reign of terror. At that time, the Imperial presence in Valenwood was little more than a collection of taxmen, and so the Bosmer were willing to support (or at least accept) any leader who promised to give them their independence and a sense of dignity. After the horrors of the Usurper’s reign, and his ultimate failure, this desire for a strong Valenwood appeared to fall through; most Bosmer ceased complaining about the Empire, but also ceased looking up to the Camoran dynasty, retreating to their clans and tribes and making the late Third Era one of the lowest points of Bosmeri nationalism.

However, Bosmeri (or Aldmeri) nationalism appeared to enjoy a resurgence soon after the Oblivion Crisis, and a considerable (although impossible to accurately measure) portion of Bosmer were supportive of the coup in 4E 29. Now the Bosmer find themselves as part of a new empire, the second Aldmeri Dominion, and it is, as ever, with those words that Imperial knowledge peters out. We have no way of gauging the degree of loyalty the Boiche hold for the Dominion, and when (or if) their new masters will outstay their welcome in Valenwood remains to be seen.


**Conclusion and Final Thoughts**

When I first set out to compile this treatise, my hope was that it would make demonstrate to the reader the intrinsic value of the study of this oft-neglected people, the Boiche. My own passion for the culture, history, and society of the Bosmer has driven me to great lengths, collecting and collating Imperial knowledge on Valenwood and its people, and presenting it in what I dearly hope will prove an insightful and accessible form.

With the current political situation being as it is, the heart of any scholar of my field is heavy with sadness and apprehension. It is my sincere belief that not only my own studies, but all Imperial scholarship and culture, are truly impoverished by the closure of Valenwood’s borders, and the loss of free access to that kingdom’s rich bounties of culture and history.

The Bosmer are a unique and fascinating people, with an ancient and beautiful culture. Above all other peoples of Tamriel, the Bosmer may claim a tradition of peace and simple happiness. They care little for the trappings of temporal might – they are not great conquerors, or soldiers, merchants, or heroes. They are the Tree Sap People, and for them life is to be enjoyed, a unique gift of the natural order to be celebrated and shared, and we, the warlike, close-minded, and self-centred men and mer of Tamriel, have much to learn from them.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Mages,True,t3_18jmat,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18jmat/the_boiche_a_treatise_on_the_elves_of_valenwood/,

As far as I’m aware, there are only two instances of them in the entire story; one in Apocrypha (named Sahrotaar), and one guarding the word wall for Bend Will in Solstheim (think that one respawns, not sure).


I don’t have any decent pictures of one, which is a damn shame since much of this is gonna be based on how they look. They have the basic shape of a dragon, but other than that share very little similarities. From memory, their heads and neck resemble that of an eel, with the lower jaw jutting forward. What I find odd is the complete lack of horns and spikes, something that every other type of dragon has.
 

Most likely they’re a sub-species of Dovah, but considering how big the differences are, as well as their rarity, I have another idea.
 

I think that the Serpentine Dragons are the direct or indirect work of Hermaeus Mora. Durnehviir sought out the Ideal Masters in the Soul Cairn because he wanted the knowledge and power to become dominant. Dominance is what drives a dragon. Alduin went against his purpose because of it, and even the Dragonborn is subject to it. It’s not odd to think that other dragons would seek out the knowledge to achieve more power, and what place holds endless halls of knowledge?
 

Apocrypha, that’s what.
 

A few of them - probably numbering the single digits - entered Mora’s library in search of ways to become stronger, likely through new words of power. But they kept reading, kept searching. They’d be arrogant enough to assume themselves above mortal temptation, and all the fools lost in their lust for just another book. But as most know, Apocrypha is like an Eldritch TV Tropes, and even someone as great as Morian Zenas - who could keep their mind together through the nightmares of Quagmire and the horrors of Coldharbour - never returned from it.
 


I also remembered [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14f6pg/my_theory_on_seekers_dragonborn_spoilers/) from a little while back, suggesting the Seekers were once normal men and women who came for knowledge and found it, but never stopped looking. Either through Hermaeus Mora himself or simply from wandering his realm for too long, they changed, coming to resemble the world around them. The same might have happened to what would become the Serpentine Dragons, their forms shifting to become as sleek and slimy as the tentacles doting the ocean.
 

Of course, they still resemble unaltered dragons, to some extent. If Seekers were once man or mer, then it’s damn hard to tell now. If I had to guess, they either kept their form due to the strength of their souls, or because Mora wanted them that way. Both reasons (especially the latter) would also explain why Miraak isn’t affected by this. A Dragonborn isn’t just something that wanders in everyday. Dragons are rare visitors too, but not as rare as a Dragonborn, so he doesn’t mind them losing themselves as much.
 

As for why there’s one chilling out at Saering’s Watch, I’d imagine it’d have to be because it’s the only wall for Bend Will that (still?) exists on Nirn. It wouldn’t make much sense for Mora to have the dragon guarding it, so it’s probably Miraak, who wouldn’t want anyone else knowing what he knows. How he could get a Serpentine Dragon out of Apocrypha, I don’t know. Possibly the All-Maker Stones, since he can use them to manifest outside of Oblivion and nab dragon souls.

I've checked the search bar and haven't found a discussion like this since the start of the subreddit and I hope the mods are cool with it.

Since I am in the minority who favour the Stormcloaks over the Empire I think it'd be best if I start the discussion off. I chose Stormcloaks over the Empire because I think the Empire is weak and dying and isn't the same beast that the Septims ruled. It's demise was predicted by the avatar of Tiber Septim, Wulf:

&gt; ""The Emperor is getting old. Don't know how much longer he'll hang on. So is the whole Empire, for that matter. Getting old, that is. The Emperor and the legions have held the Empire together for hundreds of years. It's been a good thing, by and large. But maybe it's time for a change. Time for something young and new. What? No idea. Because I'm old. Old dog doesn't get new ideas. But maybe young folks like you should try some new ideas. I don't know. Could be messy. But change is never pretty.""

Although this isn't proof that the Empire will die by or during the next game, it's a pretty chilling omen. In the context of Skyrim then the Mede Dynasty is essentially trying to keep hold of the scraps that Ocato left them whilst altogether delaying the downfall of Cyrodiil. In my opinion delaying the end is not a good idea since it's just leaving an easy target for the Dominion to aim for. 

As for the character of Ulfric and a Stormcloak Skyrim. Many people have misgivings for the future of Skyrim under Ulfric's leadership. The only big change would be the militarisation of the masses. Skyrim would begin to prepare for the next Great War with the Dominion. Dialogue during the CW questline shows that Ulfric has sent out emissaries to High Rock already (and IIRC Hammerfell too) meaning that he wants to continue the bond between provinces that the Empire solidified. 

To conclude my belief is that an independent Skyrim would be stronger than a Skyrim chained down to a dying Empire. Please disagree with me in the comments and continue the discussion.

* You are considered to be of age at 16. Before that you need a guardian. [1]
* There is no education provided by the state, and it is at the responsibility of the childs parents/guardians. [1]
* Everyone in the hold pays a tithe to the Thane or the Hold [2]*
* Taxes can be raised at whim, and not everyone pays the same amount. [3]  

And I presume this too is a law, but the basis for it in written, ingame documents is weaker. 

* The Accepted Religions are those of the traditional Nordic Pantheon and the Nine Divines. Worship of gods/spirits outside of these is banned.*

*Ulfric Stormcloak seems to have gone against Skyrims Offer [2], of which one of the freedoms granted the Dunmer are exemption from taxes. Dialogue with Viola Giordano seems to suggest that not only are the Dunmer taxed, but they are also taxed higher than the nord population. This might be because Skyrims Offer has expired, but shouldn’t be dismissed easily. 

*Following Skyrims Offer [2] the only ones we know have had religious freedom are the Dunmer. However, one of the stipulations of the offer have already been broken. [See above.] It is unknown if the Dunmers of Eastmarch have religious freedom.

I have recorded each of my visits to each realm of the Daedra immediately after I made my return, and have, as of now, not visited any realms known to drive people to insanity. Secondly, I would like to clarify that I serve none of these Princes of Oblivion, and it is most often my unaffiliated status that curries favor with them enough to let me visit their realm. I hope you all learn from these books of mine, and I hope for more to reach your libraries in due time.*

It was a very simple place, the Pits of Peryite. Not boring, but certainly not the most entertaining of the realms. Everything was correct. I could find no flaw in any of the Prince's organizations. Everything looked as though it belonged where it was, and it was so aesthetically appealing, that I almost began to distrust it. 

Some of you may be wondering why they are called ""Peryite's Pits."" This is becuase, quite literally, the place is a field of pits. Every pit contains its own category and subcategories. There is a pit for all the other realms of the Daedra, a pit in which the souls of his followers reside, a pit for each disease he has released or ever will release, and within that pit, all of the numerous things that can cause each specific disease. Then, at the center of the symmetric field, was the largest pit of all. Peryite's Pit. His Palace of Pestilence, his Abode of Order, his Domain of the Dragon. And it was here that I learned the most about Peryite himself.

He spoke with me, and, unlike many other Daedra, was very polite, calm, and submissive to my questions. He seemed borderline eager to answer me each and every time, which pleased me to no end. He told me about his part in the Ehlnofex Wars, as well. That was a story worth telling again.

""I've been around for a long time, mortal. But you knew that. Do you know why I've been around so long? Of course not. Because you mortals take all of my work for granted. That isn't to say that I don't appreciate you all for having given me a reson to exist, but a little credit for stabilizing everything you know and love would be nice, just every once in a while. That's why I have my followers' and priests' souls venerated on their pit. But, as I was saying, I, like many other Daedra, are direct descendants of the God-King, Auri-El. I had nothing to do with the fighting between the King and the Rebel, but at some level, I feel like I started it. It was my hunger for clarification that drove me to, at some point, demand the et'Ada to pick a side. They ended up forming armies, which I also organized. I had no allegiance to Auri-El or Lorkhan, but they both trusted me. In fact, I also helped Magnus with the original idea for creation. I helped Y'ffre when the Bosmer couldn't decide what shape to take. I helped the prophet Veloth to decide which Daedra were good, and which were bad. I yet today help the Imperials, Stormcloaks, Dominion, and all your other petty squabble-groups to shape themselves effectively. Without me, everything would fall into disarray.

""You also might be wondering why I look like a dragon. I am from Auri-El, the original Time God. You mortals have attributed the image of the dragon to Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time, and thus forced that image upon me, as well. For how can time flow, or be measured, or be kept in tact without some sort of orderly maintenance?

""You ask why I am the Prince of Pestilence? It is because not all things need to carry on beyond their usefulness. Plagues are released to cleanse the unnecessary from the existence of the necessary. You are a scholar, yes? Then you should know by now that nothing happens by chance. Everything from the eradication of the Kothringi to the slow, painless fading of a wife in the smallest village of the smallest county are equal in impact when perceived in retrospect. It is within my authority to dictate whether people are necessary or not. 

""Am I the weakest of the Princes? No. There are many weaker than me. Am I the strongest? No. There are more that are stronger than me than there are those who are less. I am powerful because of my urge to maintain balance and order, but I am not the most ambitious in that effort. Jyggalag is by far the most driven to do what should be done to make order of things, and Mehrunes Dagon is the most ambitious toward doing what he thinks he needs to do. But Dagon, he does not think. He acts, and he is undone by unforeseen events. And Jyggalag, he is overly ambitious. He wants nothing to be out of place. Nothing can exist without its opposite, and Jyggalag would do anything to ensure that madness and chaos were forever so contained that order could never even be found.

""I am glad that you came seeking me, scholar. It has been pleasing to me that you listened to my words attentively and eagerly. I would give you something of mine, but many of my gifts are undesirable to you and your kind. If you are willing to take what you have learned as my gift, you are welcome, but merely ask what you desire and I will give it to you.""

I left the Pits after that and wrote it down. I then vowed to travel to every plane of the Daedric Princes that I could, from Coldharbour to the Deadlands to the Evergloam to the Shivering Isles. This is my first story, but soon there shall be more.

This post comes with a small amount of pretext: Obviously the Elder Scrolls series is based on the player's ability to create whatever experience he/she wishes within the confines of the game. My question is just based on a little bit of speculation paired with some things that could be happenstance. 

Now, according to UESP ( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hero ): 
The heros of each of the main releases (Arena, Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim), are all linked to the province of Cyrodiil. Daggerfall and Morrowinds' heroes are both sent to their respective destinations by the empire based on events occurring in said areas. Arena and Oblivions' heroes both have to escape from dungeons/prisons in the Imperial city. Finally, Skyrim's hero was caught up in an ambush while crossing the boarder from Cyrodiil to Skyrim. With all of that said, could it be presumed that each of these heroes is theoretically 'supposed' to be of the Imperial race? (I of course say 'supposed' with the utmost skepticism and a little sarcasm as well)

Now, I give my little bit of evidence based on the games I've played and studied thoroughly (very loose, suspect statement, I know. But if you really need proof, you're welcome to question)

The Nerevarine is pegged by everyone as an 'outlander'. This of course could make him any of the races, but to narrow the list down, who do the Dunmer have the most strained relationships with? Khajiit and Argonian players are discriminated against in the province; however, considering the laws (or lack-thereof) regarding slavery, a Khajiit or an Argonian player would have at least ONCE been targeted by Dunmer looking for slaves (if AI was a much more sophisticated of course, much speculation here). Nords would of course have to deal with millennia of bad blood dating back to the times soon after the Velothi migration, but their long-time rivalry rooted in war and bloodshed has long-since been dimmed by this time. Finally, Altmer also have a long-standing strained relationship with the Dunmer, but would it be so hard to think that an incarnation of a Chimer hero could be one of the Dunmer's closest relatives? Imperials (and the Empire) are a present-day threat (in the time of the TES:3), would be hated by both the Great Houses (save maybe Hlaalu) and the Ashlanders, would be readily accepted by the Blades, and would totally need the power of prophesy on their side to be deemed the Nerevarine.

The Champion of Cyrodiil is probably the hardest to pinpoint, and will probably be the hardest sell, as it were. He/she of course does start their journey in the Imperial prison. Valen Dreth, your fellow prisoner, mentions to an Imperial PC, ""Oh, look, an Imperial in the Imperial Prison. I guess they don't play favorites, huh?"" Yes, he could just be comment on the minute irony of an Imperial in and Imperial jail, but to me, this is a slight allusion to the fact that to this point, each PC in the main release has been theoretically an Imperial, or at least the Eternal Champion from Arena was also an Imperial locked away in the Imperial dungeons. 

The Dovahkiin of course has to do with the lineage of 'Dragonborn' figures in TES lore. Granted, being Dragonborn is not so much a hereditary trait as it is a gift from Akatosh; however, Akatosh has connections to Alessia, Reman Cyrodiil (through Alessian Order), and the entire Septim line, from ol' Tiber himself (not an Imperial no matter how you slice it, but his lineage is), up-to-and-including Martin (obviously). While Nords seem to be the keepers of the legends of Dragonborn heroes and the Thu'um, Imperials seem to be the ones that have a history of *being* Dragonborn. 

So there you have it. My hastily-researched, convoluted, and probably wrong theory of each hero theoretically being an Imperial. Let me know what you think, and anything added (or subtracted) will be most appreciated.

Card games began in Morrowind with the ancient Dunmeri word ‘card’, or ‘undeparted kin-wardens,’ which in turn refers to — behind the slightly obtuse language — the various forms of undead found in Dunmeri tombs: Ancestor Ghosts, Bonewalkers, Bonelords, and so on. The Dunmeri New Temple’s officially sanctioned explanation for the leap of language from ancestor guardians to slips of paper employed in gambling games has to do with the original use of the cards (here referring to the slips of paper) as tools of mysticism and divination. The tradition amongst such diviners is to rub the ashes of one’s own ancestors into the paper, enriching the paper with the knowledge of the benevolent dead.

However, there is also an unofficial explanation. Said explanation is reviled and censored by the New Temple as sacrilege and blasphemy, but it is certainly a much more entertaining theory. According to a certain story which is somewhere between a folktale and an urban legend, the ancestor guardians themselves invented the game. The tale goes that a particular tomb robber (tomb theft being a terrible crime in Morrowind, but also one from which opportunistic adventurers and merchants were and are more than willing to profit) entered his most recently targeted tomb to discover that the ‘cards’, or ancestor guardians, were playing an odd game with slips of paper.

Presumably, guarding ancient tombs is a rather boring job, so these specific guardians had invented a game to pass the time. The enterprising tomb robber watched on for a short while, learning the rules of the game, before charging out of the shadows and putting silver to the spirits, as tomb robbers do. He retrieved the deck and spread word of the marvelous ‘card’ game, or the game played by ‘cards.’ The game was a hit, swiftly spreading from the tomb robber’s personal circles to all of Morrowind. Over time, some amongst the common folk forgot that the ancient word ‘card’ referred to the guardians, and assumed that the word ‘card’ referred not to the inventors and original players of the game, but to the slips of paper themselves.

The Dunmeri card game developed a set standard, mired in a sticky mixture of religious symbolism and greed. The intense Dunmeri numerology and symbolism of the standard deck is especially interesting, what with its sixteen cards per suit (analogous to the sixteen Daedric Princes), its inclusion of a group of ‘Power Trio’ cards (originally played out by the three Good Daedra, and then by the Tribunal, and now by the Good Daedra again), its three suits (most often accompanied with the same imagery as the ‘Power Trio’), its twelve minor cards (analogous to the Four Corners of the House of Troubles confronted by the three Good Daedra, to the Heavens that are the twelve worlds of creation, and to the twelve New Temple Saints with the exception of the Tribunal), and so on. The use of guar-bone dice was introduced to the game later on, borrowed from a popular game amongst guar herders. The particulars of gameplay shall be discussed later on.

Card games were first introduced to the Empire, and thereby to Tamriel at large, by the Dunmeri Empress Regent Katariah. The preserved and highly treasured letters of the Vlindrel family reveal that Katariah introduced the game to her nobles on more than one occasion, and stubbornly labored to ensure that the game became a popular upper class pastime. Modern historians believe that Katariah’s propagation of her native card game was yet another of her clever diplomatic tactics. By teaching her court to play the game, she not only established a shared interest between herself and the nobles at large, but she gained access to a coartload of gossip, as many wealthy and powerful figures cannot help but gossip as they gamble.

Katariah, in her extensive diplomatic travels throughout the Empire, spread the seed of the Dunmeri card game throughout Tamriel. Predictably, the game took strongest root in Cyrodiil, the home of  Katariah’s court. Because the game first had to filter through the noble classes before reaching the common folk, the Imperial deck is arguably the most convoluted. For example, in the name of adding their own brand of religious imagery, the nobles separated the suits into entirely different themes; for example, the ‘Power Trio’ of each of the three suits is aligned to a particular set of three of the Nine Divines.

He acknowledges his numbers, he acknowledges the density he creates and the forces that density attracts.

As I have been replaying through the College of Winterhold quests, something that has continued to irk me is the absence of a real explanation of the Great Collapse. Though the only real excuse for the collapse was the typical, ""The College did it"" rumor, I tried to delve deeper into the matter and find out what I could. 

The first source I found was *On The Great Collapse*, one of the Archmage's response to the Jarl of Winterhold on the subject. Upon reading it, I came across this phrase:

&gt; even though the vast majority of [the College mages] actively worked to counter the actions of the Mythic Dawn cult - *On The Great Collapse*. 

This puzzled me. Why would the Archmage, addressing the Jarl about the Collapse, mention the College **actively** fighting the Mythic Dawn cult during the Oblivion Crisis, that happened almost 140 years prior?

This got me thinking. What if there was a connection to the actions of the mages during the Oblivion Crisis, and the Great Collapse? Following the subject of the Mythic Dawn, I logically looked to their Daedra of choice, Mehrunes Dagon. While researching him, I stumbled upon this:

&gt; Mehrunes Dagon seems to prefer natural disasters -- earthquakes and volcanoes -- for venting his anger - *On Oblivion* 

If Mehrunes Dagon, the patron of the Mythic Dawn, prefers natural disasters such as earthquakes to vent his anger, then why not tsunamis? Looking back to *On the Great Collapse*, it seems that the tsunami that caused the collapse was unnatural:

&gt; And now, the storms that have wracked the coast of Skyrim for close to a year have finally broken - *On The Great Collapse*

Storms of city-collapsing magnitude, continuing for a year? While Skyrim has it's fair share of storms, I began to doubt that it could be simple nature that would cause such a thing. 

In conclusion, it seems to me, that Dagon might have somehow caused the Great Collapse in revenge for the College of Winterhold's efforts against the Mythic Dawn during the Oblivion Crisis. 

Now that we have possibly found the who and the why, I am left wanting an explanation for the timing. Why would it take 140 years after the Crisis for Dagon to strike back?

I'm sure this isn't news to you folks, but I went deeper. First up: here is my transcription of each rune.

* Fire: HEFHED is written large in the center. Surrounding it in a circle are, starting at the top and going clockwise, Meht, Hekem, Quam, either Geth or Iya (the picture was unclear), Tayem and Hekem written as a dipthong, Seht, Cess, and Payem. Hefhed transliterates to F, probably for Fire. The circle is M, H, Q, G or I, TH, S, C, P.

* Lightning/Shock: LYR at the center; Meht, Hefhed, Quam, Geth or Iya (again, unclear source), Tayem and Hekem together, Seht, Cess, and Payem. L (lightning), M F Q (G or I) TH S C P.

* Frost/Ice: SEHT at the center, Meht, Hefhed, Quam, Geth or Iya, Tayem/Hekem, Lyr, Cess, and Payem. S (snow), M F Q (G or I) TH L C P.

You'll notice some patterns here. Meht, Quam, Geth or Iya, Tayem/Hekem, Cess, and Payem are always the same. These six letters are always present, always in the same spot. The upper right and lower left letters are the only deviants. Now for two of our runes (Ice and Shock), you'll notice a nice second pattern. If we name shock Lightning and ice Snow, then all three runes have their first letter in the center. Fire has Hefhed, Lightning has Lyr, Snow has Seht. Lightning and Snow have the other two types (Hefhed and Seht or Lyr, respectively) in the two variable positions. Fire, unfortunately, breaks this as the upper-right symbol is clearly Hekem, and not Lyr. The lower-right, Seht, does fit the pattern though.

So: my conjecture on this is that CPM and QITH (I makes more sense than G there, but it could be QGTH) are representative of rules governing the rune's function. They could even be ""calls"" to a greater body of law somewhere in Oblivion (since runes are written in Daedric script, this isn't a huge leap) that govern Runic behavior. Perhaps using different letters or combinations thereof could change the properties of the rune. The central letter obviously determines which element the rune holds, and the other two (in my theory) serve as a sort of elemental ""balance."" Since Mundus seems big on the whole balance thing (typically in duality: no trinities besides the elemental set come to mind), the unexpressed elements must have some presence in the equation.

I don't know why Fire is different, why it has hekem **EDIT: I typed in the wrong letter (hefhed) and threw off b-rad-oleary and that was my mistake)** instead of lyr. So that is a weakness in my theory. But given what we've seen, would it not be feasible to say that by modifying the governing words, currently  cpm and qith (assuming they're read in that order; again, I'm making up an incredible amount of conjectural science), an enterprising mage could change the way his runes behave? Could we not even, perhaps, link multiple runes together? By writing in a ""dependency clause,"" runes might be configured to trigger on something other than proximity, or have effects different than simple pure-elemental blast.

In summary: the letter in the center of Destruction runes dictates the element type. The letters surrounding it govern the rune's behavior. The geometric pattern (large circle containing four smaller circles, a constant in-game) could also be changed for effect. I don't know what the two phrases mean or their significance, but they clearly have some purpose and meaning.

Magicka does share similarities to energy in our universe. We also know that there is at least a concept of temperature in Nirn with all the different climates. At this point it's fairly safe to at least assume that Magnus gives off heat. However the implications still raise question. The climates of the different areas of Nirn don't seem correspond to this theory. Then again, does Nirn move like Earth? Another question, although a little far from this topic, is Argonian biology. Do they have the same properties of reptiles? Do they need a larger amount of heat or magicka during the day than other races? Are they even cold blooded? Does Hist sap make them warm blooded?

So as the title suggests this is about Rune. 

Now who is Rune? Nobody knows, we only know he was found as a baby, shipwrecked on the coast of the ghost sea by a farmer. He was also found with a rune (which unfortunately we cannot see). Most importantly though, he is Imperial. 

Next, for the less useful but perhaps relevant facts: he appears to be a generally nice guy, he doesnt like stealing for nothing, he does it to make ends meet, he acts nice both to you and brynjolf for letting him join. He also gives Karliah the benefit of the doubt, etc etc.. He is a nice person, steals because he must, and perhaps those traits are hints from the writers?

On the latter subject, we learn hes never met them, no idea who they are. Hes also hired someone to look for them, which in a note, mentions his sources are quite excellent. Now, keeping that fact in mind, I shall drag your attention to one particular line in this note found in the cistern: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_Word_Yet ""*I still can't find a trace of your parents. Whoever they are, they've completely erased themselves from history*."" Now why use those specific words, doesnt it seem perhaps a bit familiar? Like, say, what happened to a certain Corvus Umbranox? Now lets bring back the fact he was found by a shipwreck, and hes Imperial.

Now that that is said, we cannot know for certain what happened to Rune's parents, perhaps theyre still alive, perhaps they dropped off Rune themselves, for him to be found by others. I would lean towards this possibility because Nocturnal knows ive done enough diving in the shipwrecks everywhere to make sure (Pilgrims trench was an icy nightmare) that the cowl or any such corpses are there. Because why would Rune have been found alone safe and sound on the ground?

Now, returning to the cowl, everyone who has done the thieves guild remembers the new bust, showing off a cool new Gray Fox Cowl model. To this I raise the question, why make one so detailed, with the runes with a highly detailed look if it were only to tease us with it? Now I know the enchantment should be broken by Corvus, but this IS a daedric artifact, and a lot can happen in 200 years, whos to say no one restored the enchantment, or brought it back before Nocturnal? This has happened with the key, why not the cowl? She seems to have a history of her artifacts being stolen and returned. 

Funny enough to note: in Cyrodiil it seems to be more about stealing for good, for the beggars and stealing from Nocturnal, while in Skyrim its more stealing for wealth, for personal gain, for Nocturnal. Perhaps its the case everywhere now, but I would certainly hope not.

Anyhow, with that I finish by suggesting that we may see the Gray Fox Cowl related to Rune and his parents as a side mission in the future big skyrim expansion.

Kagrenacs Tools doesnt say much about the forging of Wraithguard, Keening and Sunder.

 &gt;Kagrenac forged three great enchanted artifacts, which are called Kagrenac's Tools. Wraithguard is an enchanted guantlet to protect its wearer from destruction when tapping the heart's power. Sunder is an enchanted hammer to strike the heart and produce the exact volume and quality of power desired. Keening is an enchanted blade that is used to flay and focus the power that rises from the heart.

I have no theories on the materials used to forge Wraithguard and Sunder- but it did occur to me there is some distict visual similarities between the crystal blade of Keening, and refined Aetherium.

We know that Aetherium once refined was capable of holding immensly powerful enchantments and yet was extremely stable 

&gt;while it has a strong magical aura, it is alchemically inert, and no known process can enchant, smelt, mold, bind, or break it. 
~ The Aetherium Wars

With Aetherium's unique resistant 'anti magic' properties and its power storage potential, would it be possible that the blade of keening is in fact a refined Aetherium shard? 

Edit: Thats not to say just any old shard with a hilt slapped on would do the job of Keening- Kagrenac was a master craftsman and no doubt would have woven a great deal of magic and skill into crafting a blade designed to tap the power of the Heart. Just theorising at base materials.

Where this ultimately ends up in my mind is how the appearance of dragons possibly relates to how the events of the game play out in the long haul.

This is detailed in the book *Report: Disaster at Ionith*, where it is said that the battlemages reported weaker magic while on the island.  Furthermore, they also state that something is interfering with magical communication with Tamriel.  This is attributed to the Tsaesci interfering with their magic.

If the Tsaesci have such powerful magic here, why are there not mages in the front lines?  I believe instead that, for some reason, magic simply doesn't work as well as it should on the continent of Akavir.  This explains why magic wasn't working for the Imperials, why there are no Tsaesci battlemages seen, or even really accounts of their magic, and perhaps also explains why they have superior military strategy, having to adapt without magic.



This is bizarre, of course, and I am not quite sure why it happens as it does.  However the implications of this are even stranger.


When the often unpopular subject of firearms are brought up, people are directed at mages, and quickly told that firearms would be useless.  Furthermore, the continent of Akavir is assumed to be at war with itself during times of no interaction with Tamriel.  Furthermore, the culture of Akavir, especially Tsaesci, is very similar to that of East Asian culture, and the first firearms originated from here.

###A Pocket Guide to the Ages

*Part II*
____
So, traveler, from genesis to generations, we have arrived. The Aurbis stood strong, offspring of order and chaos alike flourished. Many such beings, the et' Ada, came to be. However, this place was still shapeless and without character. As more lesser gods faced realization of their own presence, so did they realize their own dislike of such emptiness. And as with all blank slates, sooner or later somebody starts writing.

The greatest of these authors soon realized his talent for not only seeing what is not there and what could come to be; but his talent for convincing his peers. Some say convincing, others say manipulating. Which does not matter, for the result remains the same. One Padomaic spirit of many names, Lorkhan; the creator, the trickster, the tester; saw what this beginning place could become. With a silver tongue and a boisterous spirit he went to the other et'Ada with his plan.

Magnus, lord of magic and mystical things, agreed to be his architect. With his servants, the Magne Ge, Magnus set to work laying a schematic; stone, sod; bone, blood; wisdom and will would all be his mortar. While the blueprint for Lorkhan's house was written, he approached others for investment.

Whether the implications of such a contribution was known to the et'Ada who agreed, we cannot be sure. What we can be sure of, however, is those who laughed at the face of a new world unbound did not forget Lorkhan's ingenuity. 

Many et'Ada went to craft their own lands, aspects of themselves. But, with absolute control comes a plane of servants and slaves. Their realms would never hold as high as the place that would soon be realized. The many heads of the hydra snap and bite, unpredictable and beyond control. The serpent has only one head, reigned by focus but chained by regal opinion. These kingdoms would persist, but rarely prosper.

Should a wanderer such as yourself wish to see these realms with your own eyes, do not be discouraged by the tumultuous nature that the Aurbis had become at this stage. Already, many houses lie stable. The Pits, Peryite's land of lava and pestilence; it is advisable to receive proper vaccinations. The silver towers of Moonshadow, blessed by Azura's dawn and dusk; be cautious of what may appear stunning or silent, this land of beauty hides many secrets. To run among the Hunting Grounds and all it's organic splendor, but be wary of Hircine's manbeast; adorned with tattoos of pursuits dictation, he is voracious. 

With the turning of the heavens, Aka's might passed for a period beyond metric. Conflicts among the planes were rampant. Grudges were made and sides were decided. Jyggalag, he who stood for absolute order; unwavering and unrelenting to all he disparaged or disagreed; was punished for his lack of hubris and hallowed ways. The et'Ada who were not burdened with Lorkhan's task struck in unison, cursing him to madness and schizophrenic duplicity. To march against his own heart; both black and white, without rhyme or reason.

With the map drawn and the compass set; creation stood for those who would follow Lorkhan's pilgrimage of concept. Surrounded by the cycle of other landscapes held firm by their creators, this new world stood at the center. Unstable, uninspired and uninhabited; only the et'Ada at Lorkhan's side were left to lend their hands. And lend they did. However, with all hasty decisions and uninformed investments, returns are not guaranteed.

I've recently discovered just how deep these games go and I've been pondering the pantheon's nature. I acknowledge that my understanding is very limited but I was hoping someone would venture to answer my question.

So from my understanding, Lorkhan is the mastermind behind the creation of Mundus and in some accounts Magnus is the engineer who actually built it. In someway during this creation, the Aedra gave part of themselves to create mortals and give us consciousness. This severelly limited them and weakened them which is why we see more of the involvement of the Daedra instead of the Aedra. So the Aedra either willingly or unwillingly became weaker to give men and mer life, but the Daedra have creatures that inhabit their plains. The Kyn (Dremora) actually seem to be as intellegent as men and mer. So how did the Daedra come to have beings as their subjects that seem very close to men and mer but they seemingly lost no power from it?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_19plai,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19plai/i_have_a_lore_question_about_aedra_and_daedra/,
1362020139.0,39,self.teslore,19dega,"The Music of Tamriel, a discussion.",Lorfiend,47,8,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19dega/the_music_of_tamriel_a_discussion/,"A short post, but one I've been brainstorming for a while and have decided that I've played around with this idea enough; it is ready.

**Be forewarned! What follows is a lightly edited rant about my dissatisfaction with the state of music in Tamriel, and a few rhetorical questions that (if you have the answer to) need answering (also way more commas than necessary)!**

Tamrielic music, is well, practically nonexistent. The closest thing we have to any sort of musical institution is the Bard's college, which sadly only teaches spoken word a offers basic training in 3 instruments. They offer nothing in the way of reading music (I'm highly doubtful that they have any form of notation in Tamriel), music theory (generally requires notation, but certain studies can be done without), or the creation of new songs (those are made, rather poorly, by individual bards, and generally, die with them).

This is all I know. Perhaps there is some fabled Aldmeri orchestra out in the Summerset isles, but I also find this unlikely.

Now, onto my actual notes:

*(Also note that the majority of my information is coming from a music history class I've been taking for 3 years, a music theory class I've been taking for 4, in game items, and the Bard songs from Skyrim.)*

________________________________________________________________________________________________

* **Instruments**

*Strings*.We see lutes in both Morrowind and Skyrim, so in 207 years, that instrument hasn't changed or become outdated, this is somewhat unusual considering the other Advancements of Tamrielic culture (architectural, economic, agricultural, social), however I'm willing to compare it to ancient Egypt, who took 500 years to go forms Harps to Lyres. So I'll leave strings be (but I don't want to, humph!)

*Percussion*! We see drums in both Morrowind and Skyrim as well, but still, in 207 years, we see 2 (arguably 3) kinds of drums; The Guarskin Drum, Drum, and... Drum. Was nobody on Tamriel thinking of making different things to hit? Even bigger or smaller variations on drums. Was there a collective ""Wow, this is nice. Now let's never do anything like it ever again.""? So there's my bullying on percussion.

*Woodwinds*. We see ""flutes"" in Skyrim. However I consider them to me more of a recorder, based on how they're played, designed, and how they sound. That's all we have there.

*Brass*. Nonexistent.

That concludes our four major instrumental food groups. So, nn (arguably, again) 4,451 years of civilization, we see practically no change in music whatsoever, however here on Earth in about 400 years less than that we see the invention of: 14 unique musical instruments, the birth of written notation, the birth of music theory, and the first orchestra. 

Now I know that Tamriel isn't Earth, and we made significant advances that they still have yet to make, much faster than they did/will. However, we've known of song and music in Tamriel since Ysgramor and his 500 (a good deal of songs were written about him). In fact, for a good while, the majority of Tamriel's histories were told through song, so what stopped the development of new music and/or musical advancement?

* **Music Theory**

Now, Tamrielic bard verse is fairly well done, with songs like ""The Dragonborn Comes"" and ""The Age of Aggression"" consisting of major and minor chords both. However, we see no inversions of any kind, so the chords used are simple, arpeggiated root chords. Again, you'd of think if they can figure out that E-minor resolves to G, that they'd figure out a (painfully simple) inversion like **I**-*6/4* chord.

We don't hear key changes in Tamrielic music, only chord changes that need resolution, which would imply that bards and the ""musical scholars"" (if there even **are** any!) in Skyrim have yet to discover scales.

In this (brief) essay, I will talk about how almost every aspect of life in Skyrim is focused around Horkers, and how Skyrim today is affected by them.

*""I'm going to gut you like a Horker!""*

Quite the popular threat in Skyrim. While sounding simple, this one phrase contains years of rich history, and even some insight into how Skyrim became the land it is today.

* The Economics of Skyrim:
Horkers have very easily been an influence on the Economy of Skyrim since it's original settlement. The main reason would be the selling and altering of Horker tusks for the Ivory. The use of Horker tusks in Skyrim is so large, and so widespread, that you're unlikely to find a Nord home or workplace without a few Horker Tusk crafted items. The average Nord home, in fact, contains no fewer than **One and a half** full Horker tusks worth of Horker Ivory. I should also briefly mention that Horker hides, while immensely heavy and difficult to transport, makes some of the strongest leather available, with a natural resistance to the cold!

* The Agriculture of Skyrim:
*""the meat and tusks will fetch a nice bit of gold at market."" -Heidmir Starkad, [Horker Attacks](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Horker_Attacks)* In addition to harvesting Horkers for their tusks, their meat is extremely popular in Skyrim, being both rich in protein and fat, easy and quick to cook, and resistant to cold temperatures, it's a near staple in every good citizen [of Skyrim]'s diet. Being the large animals they are, (ranging from 7 to a whopping 18 feet long at adulthood) a single Horker can feed a family for a month, and if preserved correctly, a large enough bull could for half a year. [Author's note, during my younger years, I took a trip to Skyrim and had the opportunity to sample some fresh Horker meat. It tastes delicious.] 

* The Ecology of Skyrim:
Horkers, thanks in a large part to their massive size and apparent ferocity (See, *Horker Attacks*, mentioned above) don't need to be hunted highly regularly, and nor should they be. The most common time to hunt is late during Last Seed, when the pups are now old enough to fend for themselves and the adults are fattened up in preparation for the Winter. A good hunter knows to leave the pups alone, so that next years hunt is just as good, however some poachers will kill them all the same, which can create problems in breeding. Strict enforcement on anti-poaching laws enforced by northern Jarls has helped cut back on this needless slaughter of not yet matured pups and keeps the balance in order.

I hope you have found this Essay both informative and interesting, and I hope you'll purchase my (nearly completed) book, ""The Thousand-and-One uses for Horkers: A Primer""

1360152907.0,36,self.teslore,17zu7y,"[Theory] - Concerning The Tower
",The_Collector,46,10,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17zu7y/theory_concerning_the_tower/,"*The Tower is one of the Thief's Charges and its Season is Frostfall. Those born under the sign of the Tower have a knack for finding gold and can open locks of all kinds.* - The Firmament

From my earliest experiences with the *Elder Scrolls* series, I have been curious about the star signs and ritual stones that have been repeatedly associated with the series. In particular, I have been interested in the ""Ritual"" sign and ""Tower"" signs.

Every other sign represents a fantasy archetype, or a representative being in its own right. Consider the ""Lady"", the ""Mage"", the ""Apprentice"", or the ""Shadow"", the ""Serpent"", the ""Steed"". Among these, the Ritual and Tower are oddities. While the powers typically bestowed by these signs are associated with the qualities the sign calls to mind (Paralysis in the snake, Invisibility with the shadow, etc.), both these signs bestow abilities only tangentially related to their name.

In Skyrim, the Ritual stone allows you to resurrect dead bodies to fight for you. In Oblivion, the sign instead turned undead, and restored the players health, and in Morrowind it had the same effect. If we consider the Morrowind interpretation, the sign seems to suggest some sort of holy ritual, restoring health and repelling the undead. By contrast, the Skyrim interpretation is somewhat darker, seeming to indicate a dark ritual associated with necromancy and the raising of the dead.

Now, before I start on the Tower and my interest in it, I would like to point out that the team behind Skyrim's development is a different, and larger one than that behind Morrowind. More to the point, I believe that choices were made in the later game to better reflect the given titles of the birthstones - While the link between ""Ritual"" and ""Repel the dead"" is a little tenuous, the link between ""Ritual"" and ""Raise the dead"" is easier to appreciate. So, too, with the Tower.

In Morrowind, the Tower has a strange jumble of abilities. It has abilities for detection of keys, enchanted items and animals as well as the unlocking of doors. Oblivion modified this, removing the detection aspects and focusing it on the idea of a tower as a site of defense and strength, providing defensive enchantments and retaining the ability to unlock locks, for breaking into said sites of strength. Skyrim cuts down on the powers even further, stripping away everything except unlocking locks. The purpose has changed from Morrowind, with its peculiar set of enchantments for finding and unlocking to just breaking into towers.

But I wonder. Was something missed? Something implied by the sign as it was originally, something greater than just unlocking locked doors?

It was an entry in *The Book of the Dragonborn* in Skyrim which caught my interest. It describes the events which will proceed the coming of the Dragonborn, with the events of every elder scroll game surmised as proceeding the return of Alduin. In summary of the events of Daggerfall, the following sentence is found:

*When the Brass Tower walks and Time is reshaped*

The Brass Tower - Numidium. That great and terrible entity that lies behind nearly every great mystery in the history of Tamriel, from the victory of Tiber Septim and the creation of Talos, to the disappearance of the Dwemer and the rise of the Tribunal of demigods in Morrowind. A monstrous machine, powerful enough to destroy the Aldmeri Dominion in a single day and burn the entire dwarven race from the world. A machine that, at full power, created gods.

You can probably already see where I am going with this. In Morrowind, the sign of the Tower is a charge of the Thief, a guardian constellation which governs the Shadow and the Lover as well. Those beneath it are said to have a knack for finding gold, and the season of the Tower is known as Frostfall. 

Allow me, if you will, to indulge in speculation (*gasp*). The attributes of finding keys and enchanted items, picking locks and detecting life, have everything to do with thievery and little to do with the physical object of a tower. It makes little sense for its season to be that of Frostfall (And this association is one which is seen in other constellations, for instance in the Thief residing over the season of Evening Star and the Lover of Sun's Dawn). Further, in no game has the ability to detect gold or wealth been associated with the Tower, even though it defines it in multiple games.

I believe that the answer to this misalignment may lie with Numidium, and with the Dwemer. The Dwemer in Skyrim enslaved and warped the Snow Elves, blinding and maddening them, housing them in their giant underground cities below Skyrim as slaves. Long after the fall of the elves on the surface to the Nords, the Dwemer ruled below Skyrim, until their eventual destruction by the activation of Numidium. In a sense, the Dwemer destroyed and replaced the snow elves, and then they themselves fell. Two Frostfalls, of the snow elves and of the elves that replaced them in Skyrim.

It's a tenuous link, I know, but one could also just take the ""Frost"" to simply represent the concept of a winter, the coming of a darker time of shorter and colder days. The Brass Tower brings the Frostfall, and the Dwemer are destroyed. 

As I said, speculation. But again, think about the role of the Tower as the charge of the sign the Thief - Numidium's main use throughout history was to take things from others, from Talos wrenching the empire away from the Dominion to the Warp in the West, where five separate parties all tried to use the Numidium to seize control of the Iliac Bay and all, in a sense, succeeded. Even the actions of the Tribunal were, in a sense, theft of the power of the Nuidium's heart, to make themselves gods. Numidium has always been used to steal, not gold or silver, but godhood and empires. 

As a final piece of speculation, I observe that Numidium was a great Dwemer automaton, built to resemble the centurions that defend the Dwemer's cities. The name ""Dwarf"", while referring to the subterranian lives of the Dwemer, also has connotations with wealth and possesion of gold. The Dwemer were certainly wealthy, and had large sums of both gold and their golden ""Dwarven"" metal from which golden plates, armours, and structures were built. The blessing of the Tower, long said to be that of having a nack for finding gold, is definately one that applies to the Dwemer, creators of the Numidium, the Brass Tower.

So, what am I getting at here? A lot of speculation, strands and straws and coincidences that I doubt a soul at Bethesda ever even considered, certainly. But also a theory. I believe that the power of the Numidium was so great, so immense, that it was written into the stars after its first activation. The Tower, this peculiar building in the sky among concepts and creatures, is in reality a representation of the Numidium. 

I believe that at some point, probably during the first activation of Numidium in the First Era, the only time it was ever really activated while fully powered by the original heart, the Heart of Lorkhan, which resulted in the disappearance of the Dwemer, the Numidium made its mark on the sky. The Numidium forever marked its destruction of the Dwemer in the memory of the world, as a epitaph l to a race that sought the powers of gods. And as a warning to those who might seek to follow them, of the Frostfall that might come to them in turn.

The Tower rests in the night sky, Marking the Frostfall of the kingdom of gold and power, and heralding the coming of thieves of nations.

In that thread I linked to the UESP's flawed, but helpful chart of languages found in Tamriel, and then [Lilrhys came along and supplied a superior chart in regards to accuracy](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17wmzx/when_was_cyrodilic_a_nearuniversal_language_in/c89tx0p). I then foolishly took up the challenge of making the chart much prettier.

All the credit for as to where the languages have come from goes to /u/Lilrhys (except in the case of Ta'agra and Bosmeris, in which case I accept responsibility for any potential train crash waiting to happen). 

Basically, it shows what language influenced each language going back from Ehlnofex to Tamrielic. The dotted line denotes that it is conjecture, but considering the entire thing is conjecture what I mean is: It's even more conjecturish. 

I hope you enjoy the chart and use it when ever someone asks ""Where did X language come from?"" (Though I don't think anyone has ever asked such a question.)

Just wanted to put a starter post out there on a thought I just had. When we see people in Tamriel we usually assume they live in something similar to real life feudal systems from the Middle Ages. They work farms or are apprentices. However this does not quite add up. An important detail to note is that the pubs or bars or whatever you would like to call them fill up at about 6 o clock everyday and all the stores close usually not much later than 5 or 6 at night. Now this would surely only come about with some rather liberal ideas towards workers rights and all that good stuff. And yet we still see the same type of jobs that typify feudal systems.

Now the reason this strikes me as odd is the political styles of the continent. They are usually monarchies or something to that effect with no sign of citizen involvement (aside from the very well off) or voting or anything that defines a regular liberal democracy. Mostly they can be described as fairly weak nationalistic autocracies, especially when you look at the holds in Skyrim. Now I believe there is some crucial disconnect that is not very overt that will explain the phenomena in which you have liberal workers rights or at least customs and yet a Dark Ages style of rule (and technology too for that matter). 

A large part of this, I believe comes from the difference in customs between races and lands. The conditions in Morrowind were far worse than the ones we see in Cyrodiil or Skyrim and this is fitting considering the Dunmer are ""backwards"" in their practices. I elude to their fanatical religious practices, their strict hierarchy and their ruthless crushing of dissident voices and opinions. 

However the difference is less plausible when one considers the Imperials and the Nords. Sure, there were less poor, peasant type people in Cyrodiil which can be explained by the largess of the province. The conditions for these people were the same as seen in Skyrim though. It could potentially point to a social uprising that is coming or it could just be a gameplay feature. This inconsistency is troubling though as any sociologist, anthropologist, philosopher you name it would have a tough time describing a realistic scenario in which these socioeconomic features so grossly mis-align. If this was not just a way to make it easier on the game designers then I would like to try and find the feature of society that can account for this and possibly shed light on a coming social revolution in Tamriel. I will try to research this but until I get the chance to I would love some input, thoughts and even leads if you have some.

*It is perhaps incorrect to call this tale a “creation myth” as it clearly begins some time after creation. Nonetheless, it fills the role of a mythical history which most races begin with Anu and Padome.*

*Like all the great tales of the Bosmer, “The Eight Stories of Y’ffre and the Eight Promises of the Bosmer” is intended to be shared as a poem, song, or elaborate performance with masks and costumes (where Azurah is invariably taught Payment in Kind by the generous audience), perhaps accounting for the seemingly stilted language. Regrettably, all semblance of rhyme and rhythm are lost in translation.* 

The mortals were young and Mundus was strange, and there was much they did not know about each other and themselves. The mortals did not know their proper shapes, and changed always from mer to man to beast to plant and back again. And Y’ffre saw this, and it made him sad, that the Natural Order was not yet settled. So Y’ffre Sang one of his Songs, and every mortal heard it, and every mortal knew its shape. Mer became mer, men became men, beasts became beasts, and plants became plants. And Y’ffre saw these shapes and smiled, for each was unique and beautiful. But of them all he had one special favourite. To him, the forest folk, were the most beautiful of all, though they did not yet know themselves, and he watched them always.

But Azurah saw Y’ffre’s happiness and she was jealous, for she had nothing to make her smile, and she whispered secrets and passed into the world. She saw Y’ffre loved the forest folk, and was jealous. So she took as many as she could hold, and she whispered more secrets and changed them. Azurah’s forest folk forgot their true forms that Y’ffre taught them, and Azurah taught them knew ones, more than they needed so none could tell which was right, and she told them they were Khajiit.

Y’ffre saw his favourite people change and he wept, for Azurah had spoiled his work and broken the Natural Order he had settled. So he spoke to Nirn and told her of Azurah’s wicked deeds, and Nirn wept rivers across the forests as she looked, for the forest folk were her favourites also, and Y’ffre’s Natural Order was a beautiful thing. And Nirn was sad, but Nirn was angry, and she changed the lands of Azurah’s forest folk. She made their deserts hot and dry, and she made their forests dark and filled with poison. And when she was done she thanked Y’ffre, and because she loved the forest and the forest folk, she did not change Y’ffre’s forest. It would be green and good forever. And Nirn told Y’ffre that Azurah had spoiled his Natural Order so his creations were all unbalanced, and Nirn told Y’ffre to make a new one. So Y’ffre returned to his favourite people, and he saw that they were lost and unbalanced, and he knew he must change them so they weren’t. And he thought of ways to change them.

And while Y’ffre thought, he met Z’en who lived with the men of the swamps, and Z’en taught him Payment in Kind. If he gave the forest folk only gifts, they would never know Payment in Kind, and would always be weak and greedy. Z’en was a clever god and Y’ffre believed him, and he thought of ways the forest folk could learn Payment in Kind. When he found his forest folk he had remembered all the things he knew, and all the things he could teach them.

Y’ffre knew much about names, for he had Sang them all when Mundus was new. So he Sang the forest folk his first story, and they learned they were Bosmer and not Khajiit; elves, and not beasts. And they learned the names of all the beasts, and how they could remind them of Y’ffre. 

And Y’ffre knew much about shapes, for he had already taught the mortals their own. So he Sang the Bosmer his second story, and they learned to open their eyes wide and make their ears sharp, so they could always see and hear secrets like Azurah’s.

And Y’ffre knew much about the forest, for he had Sung it to life and walked all its paths. So he Sang the Bosmer his third story, and they learned how to care for the forest as he did, even the graht oaks that were his favourite trees.

And Y’ffre knew all about bows, for he had made the first one for Auriel. So he Sang the Bosmer his fourth story, and they learned all about bows, and they made them for themselves.

And Y’ffre knew all about the Natural Order, for he had settled it twice now. So he Sang the Bosmer his fifth story and the Bosmer learned to understand the Natural Order as he did, and care for it as he did.

And Y’ffre knew all about singing, for he had taught the birds and the streams and the wind to sing. So he Sang the Bosmer his sixth story and the Bosmer learned to sing as only they can. 

And Y’ffre knew all about Singing, for he had Sang the names and Sang the shapes and Sang the secrets and Sang the stories. So he Sang his seventh story, but only to a few of the Bosmer, because too much Song would spoil his Natural Order. But Singing was harder than singing, and the Bosmer could only Roar until their voices were strong like Y’ffre’s.

And Y’ffre thought he had Sang all his stories, and the Bosmer would be happy. But he saw all that the trees saw and all that the water saw, and beyond his sacred forest he saw men and mer and beasts and others grinding their axes and stoking their fires. And he saw how already they had learned to make war, and to kill the peaceful, and to cut and burn and eat the forest. And he looked at the Bosmer and saw how they were small, and smiling and peaceful, and he knew they might never be safe, and he wept. But Y’ffre remembered there was one other thing he knew all about.
Y’ffre knew all about the chaos before the Natural Order because he had seen it all before he Sang the shapes and ended it.  And he looked at the Bosmer and he knew he had to Sing again. So he Sang his eighth story, and the Bosmer learned all about the chaos, and how to remember it, and they learned the chaos could save the sacred forest. 

And now Y’ffre had finished his stories, but he remembered what Zen had taught him. He had given the Bosmer only gifts, and he did not want them to be always weak and greedy. But Y’ffre did not know *all* about Payment in Kind, because Z’en could not Sing like Y’ffre could, and so he could not teach all like Y’ffre could. So Y’ffre had to teach the Bosmer Payment in Kind without Singing.

So he told the Bosmer there were gifts he wanted in return for his stories, and the Bosmer asked what they were.

“First,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “you must love the Natural Order as I have. You must always preserve it and never break it as Azurah did, for it is my greatest work and the smooth bones of creation.” And this was the First Decree.

“Second,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “you must never harm or abuse the plants I love, and you must never kill my trees.” And this was the Cutting Injunction.

“But,” he said, seeing how mer and men and beasts had already learned to sail, “I give you a special tree, whose fruit will bear you as wooden boats do,” and he Sang to the trees on the riverbank and they became Rellyeis. And this was the Maritime Provision. 

“And,” he said, seeing how mer and men and beasts had already learned to build great houses of stone, “I give you one special tree that is my favourite, to be your home forever,” and he Sang to the mightiest graht-oak and it came to him. And this was the Falinesti Permission.

“Third,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “you must never eat my plants. You must eat only meat, for you are hunters, and your kin must eat in three days whatever you kill, for that is the Natural Order.” And this was the Meat Mandate.

“Fourth,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “you must defend my sacred forest from those who would harm it, for it brings me great joy and gives you all you have. And you must use my eighth story only to this end, for I weep to see my Natural Order broken for nothing.” And this was the Guardianship Clause.

“Fifth,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “you must welcome peaceful visitors with open arms, for though you are my favourites, I love all who love the forest.” And this was the Oath of Acceptance.

“Sixth,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “you must make war only in defence of your lives, your kin and my sacred forest, for I weep to see my favourite people bloody themselves with war, and such death is not the Natural Order.” And this was the Promise of Peace.

“Seventh,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “You must avoid secrets and deceit, and punish those who practice them against you, for they are the ways of Azurah and have broken my Natural Order once already.” And this was the Stricture for Truth.

“Eighth,” Y’ffre said, without Singing, “You must remember me always, even when I do not walk among you, for I love you and you alone can keep my commands and care for my forest.” And this was Y’ffre’s Ordinance.

And now he had given the Bosmer eight commands, Payment in Kind for eight stories, and he gave his hand to the Bosmer, and they took it. And this was the Green Pact.

And when all this was done, Y’ffre remembered Azurah, who had not learned Payment in Kind. And he climbed the highest tree, and he Sang out loud Azurah’s secret, so that she might weep as he had wept. But she did not, and she never learned Payment in Kind.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Mages,True,t3_17icta,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17icta/the_eight_stories_of_yffre_and_the_eight_promises/,

Hello, scholars

Once again it is time for a mis-scheduled and badly timed *Community Thread!* Again, I am really sorry for the problems with timing. School, personal activities, and other such miscellaneous things sometimes get in the way of things so it is becoming quite hard to maintain good scheduling now that the first quarter of the school year is about done- marking the end of laziness and procrastination and a gate to hard work and confused scheduling.

Not going to rant about scheduling too much, I am going to post next week's thread Friday, at a more USA-appropriate time. I figured I should not post this week's at Friday because no one wants two threads of the same kind in the range of 5 days.

Anyway, on to normal Community Thread issues:

---

Despite the short week, in this relatively short period of time we did get a lot of quality discussion, and are very proud of it as mods. There was, admittedly, a higher-than-average amount of comments this week that PoP and I had to remove. Seeing as people start to forget:

Guys, can't stress this enough. I know you want to reply when it is on-context, but please joke around and talk about non-lore related issues **In the Community Threads**. We understand if a comment or two steer off the train of thought and go irrelevant but if a whole thread of comments goes out of context we have to remove it. Those are the rules, if you want to question them or change them you are always welcome to give feedback in these threads. I do understand some of you may look at these rules as too strict or oppressive, but do understand that we have our reasons. As already experienced in this subreddit before, small appearances of irrelevancy in every thread lead to the common thought that irrelevancy is okay, one thing leads to another and suddenly you have threads titled ""Cheese in Tamriel"" and ""Check out my tes metal band guys! :)""

Other than the few small problems the week was great. We've seen a few great discussions and posts, including [The Origin of the Wispmother by Regalnerd](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12f6rk/origin_of_the_wispmother/) and [dbcification's ""Of blades, myths, and Prophecies](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12c8kv/of_blades_myths_and_prophecy/). 

Keep on posting guys, you're all doing a great job!

And, as always, we must reveal yet another

**Scholar of the Week**

It's been only a little over 6 days since the last announcement of Scholar of the Week, so since then there generally has been not as much activity from any user as normally would be. *But*, one user still has generally done a great job commenting and posting this week, and that is **Dbcification**. Congratulations, and keep on posting!

---

As some of you might have noticed, we are very close to the subreddit's ***1st anniversary***. This, at-least to me, is very exciting, and we mods do think that something special should be done about the occasion. Now normally I would say something along the lines of ""And at the anniversary thread we're gonna have a really cool surprise for you guys!"" or something along similar...

...But I don't really what to do. We have already discussed some things to do in the thread, fun things, community things, etc. but we're going to need some of the community's feedback as to what you guys think should be done when the anniversary comes around. So if you have any feedback as to what you think would be fun, cool, interesting, etc. to do this November 26th to celebrate 1 year of the subreddit's existence, please do tell us. We're looking to make the occasion as great as possible.

---

That is all I have to say for announcements and the such. I assume you all know the standard Community Thread guidelines: Introduce yourself if you are new, provide any feedback you might have to the mods, respond to my pleas for help (this time about the 1st anniversary celebration), and *do whatever*. Community threads are community threads, they are meant for the community.

So yes, keep on posting and commenting, and have a great week!

1348756652.0,36,self.teslore,10kbv4,Falmer History and Culture,regalnerd,39,3,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10kbv4/falmer_history_and_culture/,"I would like to talk about a race that we have all encountered in Skyrim, the Falmer. So the Falmer are a group of elves who descend from the Aldmer who settled in Skyrim after the voyage of Torpal the Pilot. This text will primarily be focused on the pre-corruption Falmer, if you want to know more about the corrupted Falmer I suggest reading the Bloody Blackreach thread.

So we really don't know that much about the Falmer, as the ancient Nords were not all that concerned about preserving the ancient Falmer texts and ruins as they were shouting them to death. Even with the extreme lack of archaeological evidence and written records we can still learn quite a bit from what little they did leave behind, and of course what we learn from Gelebor.

According to Gelebor the Falmer pantheon consisted of Auri-El, Trinimac, Jephre, Phynaster, and Syrabane, however this seems rather small for a pantheon, especially when compared to every other culture on Tamriel besides the Dwemer. The two races that the Falmer were closest to were the Ayleid, whom they shared their language with, and the Dwemer, with whom they shared their land. Thus I propose that the Falmer empire was set up much like the Ayleid and Dwemer empires, as independent city states, each with a focus on different gods, the city state that Gelebor was a part of worshiped the pantheon he named, and other Falmer states would worship slightly different ones, coupled with the ancestor worship that is standard for all elven religions.

What do we know about the Falmer religion? For starters they are extremely focused on Aetherius and light, with the sun being of extreme importance. Thus it would make sense that the Falmer would worship Magnus. Secondly they worship Auri-El, and they had a pope like figure for his Chantry, who apparently communes with Auri-El, Vyrthur's exact words were “I had the ears of a god.”. Third is that the Chantry seemed to hold a significance to even Auri-El himself, as it appears to serve as a sort of default location of his bow and possibly his shield, given the Gelebor knows for a fact that the bow is in the Chantry.

I propose that there are twice as many Falmer ruins in Skyrim than are commonly believed. Notice how  the Architecture of the College of Winterhold doesn't line up with either the ancient Nordic ruins or the ruins of the second or third empire that still dot the land. The College of Winterhold has statues of Magnus situated in the main courtyard, with Magicka pools all around, along with carvings of eyes. Remember what Vyrthur calls the sun in his prophecy? The eye of the dragon. I propose that the College of Winterhold was an ancient Falmer temple to Magnus. And that the Night of Tears was a simple turf war, the Nords were expanding into sacred territory. I do not believe that it was over the Eye of Magnus, because whatever the Eye may be it popped up in Saarthal sometime after Jyrik Gaulderson was sealed there.

1329614077.0,35,self.teslore,pvwe2,The Altmer: A Cultural Perspective.,nerdlights,41,6,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/pvwe2/the_altmer_a_cultural_perspective/,"I decided I'd take a crack at submitting something useful, and answering some questions you guys may have about certain things in TES. Specifically culture, race, and history.

So to begin this, I'll start with a race that has become prominent in the 4th Era, the Altmer of Summerset Isles. 

The Altmeri come from a group of Aldmer which stayed on the Summerset Isles while others traveled to Valenwood and the rest of mainland Tamriel. They are the closest relation to the Altmer, and in fact would be practically indistinguishable from ancient Aldmer.

The Altmer, or High Elves, are native to the beautiful nation of the Summerset Isles. It is presumed that they live on average anywhere from centuries to thousands of years. (One has been documented as living for 3000 years) They call themselves the ""Cultured people"". Culturally, they place heavy emphasis on the more artistic pursuits. Art, Writing, Law etc. The common tongue of Tamriel is actually based off of Altmeri language. In fact, many cultural advances in Tamriel have been a result of their ideas. To put it simply, what the Dwemer were to technology, they are to artistic culture. Because of this, the Altmer have developed a snobbish view towards other races of Tamriel. This doesn't mean they don't respect them, but they believe they're not as cultured as they are. Which isn't false in this case. So Art is pretty much their defining cultural aspect.

NOTE: I think it's important to clarify that while the Altmer can be snobbish, this isn't a huge part of what contributes to the Thalmor goals in the 4th Era. While the Altmer can be insufferable snobs, most of them aren't flat out evil. But more on that later.

The Altmer are naturally gifted at Magic, and are arguably the most innately talented at the art of all the races in Tamriel. All mer (save Orsimer) tend to have inclinations towards Magic, but it's especially pronounced in the Altmer.

During the 1st and 2nd Era the Altmer were absent from most events that occurred on the mainland. The sea that surrounds Summerset both saved the Altmer from and introduced them to problems. Like most other nations in the 1st and 2nd Era, Summerset suffered from internal conflict. The 3rd Edition Pocket Guide to The Empire states that
&gt;Internal conflicts between Skywatch and Firsthold, and between Alinor and Lillandril, often sparked into full war...

But much more pressing, was constant invasion from their neighboring island-farers, the Sload and the Maormer. In the second Era, the Altmer teamed up with the Bosmer of Valenwood, and the Aldmeri Dominion was formed. I think it's interesting to note that the original Dominion was one of necessity for the Altmer. This formation was short-lived, however, as Tiber Septim with the Numidium wiped the Dominion out in c.2E 896. The end of the Oblivion Crisis saw the reformation of a much more powerful Aldmeri Dominion in 4E 29, and after the Void Nights of 4E 98-100, the Aldmeri Dominion control Summerset, Valenwood and Elsweyr. 

Now what is not known to some is that the Thalmor, the rulers of the Dominion, want to eliminate all men. This dates back to their creation myths. The Altmer believe that they were divine beings before Lorkhan created Nirn. Lorkhan removed them from this divinity to create the Ehlnofey (I'm paraphrasing real hard). The Altmer, and more specifically the Thalmor view Lorkhan as bad, he made them mortal. They resent man for their belief that Lorkhan gave man the gift of life from nothing. Some wounds never heal, as they say, and the Thalmor seem to have some belief that by eliminating man, they can some how return to this divinity. You'll notice that while they're racial snobs, they don't hold issue with the beast races. In short, they're insane.

The Altmer, historically and culturally tend to be very interesting. Especially since their ruling body is nuts, but many Altmer are generally good people, and contribute much to Tamriellic tradition. If you have any questions are feel I skimmed anything let me know, I'm really trying to tie all this info to any questions anyone may have.

I know that as the Imperial City was being surrounded by the Dominion, Titus took advantage of the fact that the North of the City was not protected. He then escaped with most of his army intact to the North, where he met up with the Legion from Skyrim for the Battle of the Red Ring.

It's the part about him breaking out to the north, I still do not understand this. There's only one way out of the Imperial City Isle, and that is the bridge across Lake Rumare to the west, not North. In order for Titus to have fled, he would have had to run right by the Aldmeri army to the west of the city. Assuming that the armies had not entered the city yet, considering this was a surprise movement by Titus and would have happened in a very quick timespan, the Aldmeri army literally must have let an entire army cross a bridge that was on their flank. Not only could they have easily crished the Imperials in a straight fight, given their size, they could have obliterated them as they were forced through a narrow chokepoint. 


Maybe I'm looking into this too much. Maybe I have been playing too much Total War recently that I noticed this, but is this an oversight in the story or am I missing something? 


EDIT: The main source we have on this 


   * In 4E 174, the Thalmor leadership committed all available forces to the campaign in Cyrodiil, gambling on a decisive victory to end the war once and for all. During the spring, Aldmeri reinforcements gathered in southern Cyrodiil, and on 12th of Second Seed, they launched a massive assault on the Imperial City itself. One army drove north to completely surround the city, while Lord Naarifin's main force attacked the walls from the south, east, and west. The Emperor's decision to fight his way out of the city rather than make a last stand was a bold one. No general dared advise him to abandon the capital, but Titus II was proven right in the end.

    While the Eighth Legion fought a desperate (and doomed) rearguard action on the walls of the city, Titus II broke out of the city to the north with his main army, smashing through the surrounding the Aldmeri forces and linking up with reinforcements marching south from Skyrim under General Jonna. Meanwhile, however, the capital fell to the invaders and the infamous Sack of the Imperial City began. The Imperial Palace was burned, the White-Gold Tower itself looted, and all manner of atrocities carried out by the vengeful elves on the innocent populace.

EDIT 2: Putting this up here because taxusbaccata posted it late, but there is actually a [bridge](http://www.uesp.net/maps/obmap/obmap.shtml?locx=71584&amp;locy=75008&amp;zoom=16) to the north of the City Isle. It's small, and I actually never noticed it in all of my Oblivion playthroughs. If the attacking elves did know about it, they probably would have sent only a small detachment to guard it, since they never expected a retreat from the city anyway. The legions would have smashed through whatever was waiting for them, leaving the VIII Legion on the walls of the Imperial City, and then marched to Bruma. Even though a Dunkirk type thing happening seems really cool, it seems pretty unlikely.

I think there are several things to support this.

**1** land·fall  (lndfôl)
n.
1. The act or an instance of sighting or reaching land after a voyage or flight.

**2**""The prophet of Landfall""
&gt;He has come down from the mountains, the chitin of his belly segments freshly painted in Faith. The suns shine overhead, each uttering his name in their way. The barrens before him distort in the blur of their heat as he climbs the last hill, but his vision is clear. It always has been. His fifth and second arms encircle his staff as his mandibles click out a small prayer. Beyond the barrens lay the Crescent of the Eighty and One Thrones, and all the villages that hang from it like a jeweled belt. They do not know it yet, those millions that work, rule, and commit their countless sins out there in the cradle of all written history, but he will save them. In ones and twos, then in droves, and then their own priests and their own kings will throw down their false idols and take up the New Faith. He would permit himself some pride if that emotion occurred to him; instead, he tests his locust wings on the wind, permitting himself to glide into the first steps of Salvation.

This creature's physical description and religion are completely unknown. The fact that the emotion of pride does not occur to him seems to suggest that this ""prophet"" is also psychologically completely different from almost all thinking races. But the most glaring THIS IS AN ALIEN PLANET hint is that there are multiple suns. In the known cosmos there is only one sun, Magnus.


**3** 
&gt;When Landfall happens, you guys will do a spit-take like Bail Organa did when the Death Star showed up above Alderaan.


It sounds a lot like the ""prophet"" is going to cause the landfall. It also sounds like he is of a world unknown to us. Landfall is going to make us do a spit-take like there's an enormous space ship appearing in the skies.

So is landfall going to be an alien invasion? Many-limbed chitined creatures screaming down upon Nirn painted in the colours of their Faith?

This goes over the general life of people in the four primary kingdoms, different parts of culture (including art, architecture, writing, etc.), and so forth.  Much of this is conjecture do to the limited information available, but nothing is a massive leap here based on what we do know.

We will begin with my personal favorite; the Tsaesci.

Tsaesci is probably the country that is most easily comparable to Tamrielic life.  There are merchants, craftsman, warriors, and overseers.  The first three are obvious, the last one, overseers, is a profession that oversees the goblin laborers in the fields or mines.  The primary occupations in the southern parts of the country are mainly merchants and light craftsman (those who make light objects, out of wood, paper, or other light materials).  Towns here are often port towns, either on the coast, or along the great river that flows through the country. Houses are usually framed with wooden beams, and have a woven plant based wall, with a form of clay on either side of it.   The north has a more industrial landscape to it, with more mountains and many more mines.  Heavy craftsman thrive in this area, and warriors also exist here.  More stone houses exist in this area, and the capital city is nestled somewhere in the mountains.  Writing in the country is read from up to down, and then right to left. A sentence would be written in a long column, and once you reach the bottom, you move to the left.  Art is primarily ink drawings, primarily drawing on lines to make forms.

Kamal has a very interesting culture as well.  This country is much more based on war, and seems to have an innate need to invade, as they do so just after hibernation each year.  The average citizen is a warrior.  It's not quite known if there exists any other occupation.  They don't engage in much diplomacy, but they do have a warrior-king.  Housing is unknown, as they do not need housing to survive the long, harsh winters of the area.  Instead, they freeze in winter, and thaw out in the summer.  It could be that buildings serve a utility purpose, such as to act as a place of congregation, but that is not known.  Art is unlikely to be found in the area because of their heavy warrior culture.  They do have a knowledge of engineering, as they have weapons and armors.  Then, so do the Falmer.  It would be best to equate their intelligence to slightly above the Falmer's, as they have a central political entity, and are able to carry out rather large scale attacks.

Tang Mo is perhaps the best place for any tourists to the continent to head. The monkey residence here are very laid back, and very polite as well.  There are many 'tribes' of people here, each controlling an entire island, sometimes more.  The tribes don't often interact politically, and there hasn't been harsh blood between them.  It's hard to call this place a country really, but they do have some form of central government.  Each year, the beginning of summer is marked by a large festival, followed by each tribe offering up warriors to defend the country from the Kamal invaders.  The country has very able warriors, and they have defended against the Tsaesci, Kamal, and Ka Po'Tun in the past, all of whom tried to enslave the Tang Mo.  Housing is unknown, but this race is very intelligent.  It's likely housing exists in trees surrounding a central clearing that acts as the courtyard of the island.  Pathways in the trees are not needed and in fact, avoided.  The Tang Mo have no issues climbing the trees, and it prevents the Kamal from reaching them.  Nothing is known on the art of the area.

Ka Po'Tun, the Dragon-Tiger Empire, is probably the strangest culture in the entire continent.  They hate the Tsaesci species with a passion, but are allied with the Tang Mo (especially helpful during the Kamal attacks on Tang Mo).  Their culture revolves around war, and dragons.  The main goal of most every member of this country is to turn into a dragon.  That is literal.  Their goal is to go from being a Tiger, to being a ferocious, reptilian, winged, killing machine.  There is no known information on how that process works, however their leader has done it.  More on culture: The architecture is a stacked style of building, primarily using brick and wood.  The race is very aggressive and it is not known if they have art outside of architecture.  As said earlier; they harbor deep resentment against the Tsaesci, who killed their dragon allies.  They also, for some unknown reason, plan to attack Tamriel, possibly because Tamriel was the cause of death of many dragons as well.  Warriors are revered here, as are dragons.  This of course makes their tiger-dragon king essentially a god among them.  Shrines exist, dedicated to the dragons that were killed by the Tsaesci.  The capital is built around a mountain, on which the dragon-tiger lives.  It is unknown exactly how large this king is, though they are said to be the largest dragon in all of Nirn.  This being written before the recent dragon-crisis, it could be that Alduin and other dragons were simply uncommon at the time, but given the fact that this is even said leads me to believe that they are, in fact, VERY large.

1365433559.0,36,self.teslore,1bx5jg,I think I may have decoded the real meaning of the Elder Scrolls.,Ryuko,68,32,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bx5jg/i_think_i_may_have_decoded_the_real_meaning_of/,"First and formost, I am a neophyte of TES, but I have been doing some thinking about the Elder Scrolls and a post in /r/Skyrim got me thinking...  Tell me what you think.

The Elder scrolls likely read differently based on who is reading them based on the base of reference. The Elder Scrolls are viewed in a 2-d plane, but time is much more complicated then that. Considering the parallel universe argument that is clearly made in the game series, that would make the elder scrolls a 3d device, viewed on the 2nd plane.

Furthermore though that much information would be near useless, since no one would be able to view them. Therefor the aspect per person is KEY. This makes the scrolls a 4th dimension device.


Each person is viewing information that is unique to their universe and time line, along with possible outcomes, pertinent TO THEM.
Now, there is a 5th plane which is indicated by the fact that you cannot count the number of scrolls. First count could reveal 8, the next 24. The difference in scrolls is THE EVENTS PLANNED.


I.E. A scroll read by the Dovakin could reveal the different outcomes of becoming part of the Dark Brotherhood. But after reading through the scroll that reveals the fate of Aulduin the Dovakin could become so devoted to defeating Aulduin that they will NEVER considered the Dark Brotherhood, and in that event the Dark Brotherhood scroll disappears.

This explains many different things.  First this explains why the scrolls can be 2nd dimension, yet display so much information.  This explains why the untrained see astrology signs.  This explains why blindness is caused (information overload/seeing information not meant to be seen/consequence of observing events before they occur).  This also explains why when counted the count of elder scrolls change; even though neither count is inaccurate as all scrolls exist and fail to exist simultaneously.

Poor quality posts (review the voting guidlines to get an idea of what we consider a ""poor quality"" post) will never be completely snuffed out.

There's *9600* of you. If you were all reporting, you'd never see poor content. Obviously not *all* of that 9600 would actively report, but even if only the regulars were, that's adding a good 100 or so to our 3.

However, in my current playthrough of Oblivion I had the knowledge to understand the concepts Dyus was talking of when you meet him and ask questions about the location in which you found him.

He states the following:

&gt; My imprisonment is as meaningless as my immortality. Time and place are nothing. Constructs of a feeble mortal mind attempting to categorize and understand the world around it. If you were one of the fortunate few, you would one day understand and accept this. However, you are not and you will not.

As Dyus is the chamberlain of Jyggalag and the keeper of the library that once held all information in existence. It makes sense that he would know of the Godhead and CHIM, after all, with the algorithm of the library he could predict the endless cycles of kalpas and thus deduce the true origin of the universe.

Thus I believe that what he is saying here is that because he is aware that he is simply the derivative of a dream, he does not really care all to much where he is, for he knows it isn't really anywhere, nor does he care for time, as that doesn't truly exist either.

More particularly the line 
&gt;If you were one of the fortunate few, you would one day understand and accept this

stands out to me as it seems to be directly talking about CHIM and how the CoC (about to mantle Sheogorath) will never achieve it.

First off, this post isn't claiming that there was a completely different form of Mer in Tamriel, it's just a point at which Bosmer and Khajiit can trace their lineage back to together, like how the Orsimer can trace themselves back to the Aldmer who worshipped Trinimac/served in the army.

We all know about the Aldmer, the mer from which all other elves come from, but the I'm going to focus on a particular sect of mer.

These mer were nature lovers. They loved trees, animals, plants, birds, bugs, just everything about nature. When they left from Aldmeris they settled in the southern forests where they always reveled in the beauty of Tamriel's flora and fauna.

The Mer had spent such a long time in the forests with the animals they were often confused as to whether they were mer or beast. If they got along so well with nature like the beasts, how could they say they were not beasts? But of course they weren't like any other beasts, they knew they were mer just like the others who went to the islands nearby. Beast or Mer was confusing and they would often consider them one in the same; after all, they saw the men from the north turning into beast and plant and man again.

These mer were called the Moramer. Mora meaning forests/woods.

They could acknowledge the gift Y'ffre gave men and mer though, giving them definite shape to stop the chaos of changing forms. However, soon enough the Moramer would be found in the middle of a conflict between gods.

Azurah called out to Nirni from beyond Jone and Jode, telling her to not be sad over her favourite people, the Moramer not knowing whether they were children of Aldmeris or beast of Tamriel. Azurah spoke her first secret and passed by Jone and Jode, taking some of the Moramer and placing them into the best forests and deserts on all of Nirni. From there she made Khajiit and bound them to the lunar lattice.

But Y'ffre overheard the first secret and snuck behind Azurah, watching her taking and placing some of the Moramer where she deemed fit and changing them. Y'ffre couldn't stand what he witnessed and ran off to Nirni telling her about Azurah's deeds. Nirni and Y'ffre were quite frankly pissed and negotiated a deal.

Nirni would make life as hard as possible for the new form, Khajiit, by making her sands biting hot and her jungles filled with poison; but she would spare the remaining Moramer whom Y'ffre was allowed to change and as such she would spare the Moramer land which Azurah deemed not good enough for Khajiit. The land of Khajiit was to be ruined, but Y'ffre negotiated with Nirni so that some of the forests could still be beautiful and harmonious. From then Y'ffre left and Azurah was despised by Nirni. Y'ffre then went to the Moramer of the remaining forests and changed their form and made sure they knew they were mer and not beast, unless the gift of Nirni's deal were to in danger. Y'ffre didn't have the knowledge Azurah had, however, and thus could not make the new mer keep their shape if they had to change into beast. Y'ffre called them Bosmer and from that point, Khajiit and Bosmer were no longer considered related. The Bosmer and Khajiit had their own beliefs now, the Bosmer possessing a mixed pantheon of Men and Mer gods, the Khajiit keeping a more simple and familiar pantheon.

Y'ffre was not done, though. Thinking he could have the upper hand on Azurah, stood up and yelled out the first secret for all to hear. Again, Y'ffre didn't have a foolproof plan, but Azurah swiftly acted where she was needed and blocked the ears of Lorkhaj and Ahnurr to ensure they would never hear the first secret. This was the first of times the children of Anu and Padomay could walk upon Nirni freely, this would not last forever though. The Dragon would interrupt that, but that's a story for another time.

EDIT: I'd also like to thank lebiro for helping me out with the Bosmer stuff I was previously unaware of

I am going to post this thread a little earlier than normal due to the fact I want to get the thread done with before sitting down to study for them darn finals. 

Anyways it has been a rather interesting week for us all, I would guess, what with all the new people coming in. Let me begin by stating that I understand some scholars have voiced their opinions as to why they think some sort of coup d'etat is going on where a new generation of scholars is replacing the old one. This is not true. Us mods have been successfully dealing with the wave of new scholars and educating them about the policies of the subreddit and it seems that all is going well. There is no coup d'etat, no war, no revolution. Everything is fine. Please:

Keep calm. Carry on.

That is all I have to say for that topic. I'm not going to be ranting about the state of the subreddit any more than that because I honestly think everything is fine and dandy. Now let's move on.

Other than the few complications we faced with the uneducated crowd, we have had a pretty good week regardless. Certainly not as active as the last week since [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/168dts/a_friendly_reminder_and_an_introduction_to_the/) that quieted down things quite substantially, but still a good week activity-wise nevertheless. After that thread we also has a pretty sharp drop in the scholar count, but we regained our numbers with 216 new scholars this week, which amazes me to say is actually following the last few weeks' trend. This particular week we have had popularity in helping out the official forums' quest to Hunt the Amaranth in RottenDeaditte's Numerology in the Lessons [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16cbg6/numerology_in_the_lessons_pt_1/) / [2](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16cbvb/numerology_in_the_lessons_pt_2/) and [more conjecture about 2 and 9](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16hipr/more_conjecture_about_2_and_9/). We also got a brand new volume of [A Journey Into Oblivion](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/163zs3/a_journey_into_oblivion_volume_iii_meridias/) by b-rad as well as two great threads [Argonian Bodies in Imperial Literature by admiralallahackbar](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16cwsp/argonian_bodies_in_imperial_literature/) and [New Words by Clan Mother Ra'Paahrmi by Mr_Flippers](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16djjd/new_words_by_clan_mother_rapaahrmi/). Thank you everyone for posting and commenting, as well as being so devoted in answering all the new people's many questions.

I'd like to just remind everyone that despite explanations and apocryphas being awesome, question threads are very much a defining part of the subreddit. We got some grudge against all the question threads, but I guess that's only because of some confusion over what is a good question thread and what is not. Good question threads are ones that ask questions that could not normally be answered with a simple search in UESP, or ones that genuinely have curiosity and interest in mind instead of just looking for a tiny piece of Trivia. Bad ones are those have a title or content that is basically ""What do we know about x and y?"" and those that simply look for trivia. We understand you reporting about the bad ones, but there is no need for complaining about genuinely curious individuals searching for answers that could not normally be found.

Anyways with that said, thank you for the activity everyone, now let's move on to the:

I couldn't find any posts about Miraak in /r/teslore so far, so I was wondering if this post could, in addition to answering my question, fill in the gaps of my knowledge. I'm a PC player, so I haven't had a chance to play yet, but it seems like UESP has not updated with much background information on Miraak yet. Unlike the Volkihar, who were mentioned in *Immoral Blood* in *Oblivion,* Miraak does not (so far as I can tell) have any connection to the lore. Maybe someone more familiar with Herma Mora would know if Miraak could be alluded to in earlier books. 

It seems kind of like a no-brainer, so maybe this isn't a very illuminating question, but [Conjecture](/g ""is Miraak a Falmer?"")

I ask primarily because of the [similarities between the Miraak mask and [Conjecture](/g ""the Falmer helm"")](http://i.imgur.com/AAioc.png). They seem too similar to be mere coincidence on the part of the devs.

You may ask: Well, what race does the NPC body show? 

**Extremely Mild *Dragonborn* Spoiler**: When Miraak is defeated, his corpse becomes a skeleton. I say *becomes*, because his clothing and all do not stay on his body. You click on his skeleton and his articles are inside. Had he been a skeleton all along, it would make more sense (gameplay-wise) for you to only see him as a skeleton once you remove his clothing. Of course, the Dragonborn absorbs his soul, so it's possible that he looks different before the absorption and only becomes a skeleton because that's what dragons do when a Dragonborn absorbs their soul, but I haven't played yet. I have only watched the ending on YouTube.

My understanding is that during the reign of King Harald, the remnants of the Falmer in Skyrim were driven to Solstheim, hence why the Skaal thought the Rieklings were Falmer. Meanwhile, [Morrowind Spoiler](/s ""the remains of the Snow Prince are found during *Bloodmoon*."")

Can anything be made of the [buckle on his robes](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121204233751/elderscrolls/images/a/a1/Miraakrobes.png)?

Also, what does it mean for Miraak to be ""the first Dragonborn""? Does the DLC explain that in detail? I remember a thread here back when the trailer was released discussing how this required some retconning re Alessia. 

The Tsaesci think of the Dragonborn as dragon hunters. Is that simply what Miraak is: the first Dragonborn dragon hunter?

The shrine in the center of the Sacellum gives a Blessing of Arden-Sul, and the Sacellum is attended to by both a Manic priest and a Demented priest. Given that Sheogorath is master of the realm and sole god of the Shivering Isles, how is it that a former duke can command enough divine power to bestow blessings and have a religious following in the realm of a Daedric Lord?

So I got to digging, first in-game, then through the various monkeytruth posts I could find on the subject. I began with the first book I found, ""The Prophet Arden-Sul,"" which stated that the Sacellum itself predates Arden-Sul. It is here that Arden-Sul had some kind of epiphany [the Manics and the Demented differ on the method by which this epiphany was gained], and it is here that Arden-Sul would eventually die. The Manics decree that he died due to a greenmote overdose, while the Demented whisper tales of Arden-Sul ripping out his own heart after slaying his court.

The only remaining lore on Arden-Sul in-game is that given by the Heretics and the Zealots, two groups similarly divided which can be found in the numerous camps that dot the landscape of the Shivering Isles. The Heretics believe that Sheogorath is not a Daedric Lord. In fact, they refuse to believe that there are no princes in all of Oblivion. They believe that Sheogorath is a mortal man who took advantage of the teachings of the prophet Arden-Sul in order to gain power in the Isles, and seek to dethrone and kill Sheogorath. 

In direct opposition to the Heretics, the Zealots hold a far more interesting view on Arden-Sul, stating in the in-game book, ""Zealotry,"" that Arden-Sul was the mortal aspect of Sheogorath, who would eventually return to ""cleanse the realm."" What they mean by ""cleanse"" is unclear. However, what is interesting here is that Sheogorath had a mortal aspect prior to the CoC mantling the Prince of Madness. This brings up the following question: did Arden-Sul mantle and become Sheogorath prior to the CoC, and if so, is the CoC doomed to simply continue the cycle of the Greymarch, albeit on a slightly delayed schedule?

After reading Lady Nerevar's much more organized monkeytruth, entitled ""Arden Sul,"" I was swayed into believing that this may just be the case. After playing The Mind of Madness quest in Skyrim, further possible proof of Lady Nerevar's theory was given when Sheogorath [confirmed to be our CoC] spoke the following line about his title.

""I'm a mad god. The Mad God, actually. It's a family title. Gets passed down from me, to myself, every few thousand years.""

Now, while I do find Lady Nerevar's theory very convincing, I simply can't find it in myself to believe that after all that work, the CoC's struggle in the Shivering Isles was simply an incredibly long con by Sheogorath. However, there is no mention of Jyggalag in Skyrim save for a footnote in the book ""On Oblivion,"" which lists him amongst several other ""lesser-known"" Daedric Princes.

Now, we know that it's about the dragonborn and his conflict with Alduin, but what can we say for the people who'd have sung this song?

We know the dovah language to be more powerful than any other, with words that can call down lightning upon a land, so what kind of people would have been singing this song? Furthermore, what would their performance of the song have sounded like? remember back in Skyrim when the Greybeards summoned Dovahkiin (Dragon-Hunter Child for those who didn't know) it echoed throughout the country, just how booming would their song be?

I imagine that, if we take it to be like what we hear from Skyrim's theme, it'd be sung by men of the 4th era who do not know the Voice. But if it were done by Nords gifted/taught the Voice by Paarthurnax much earlier in history the song would be incredibly loud. Let's not forget the song is performed by groups of men, so however powerful their sole shout is a group performance would multiply that

1348888328.0,34,self.teslore,10nijm,"The Betrayed seem to have developed, or perhaps retained, a societal structure with gender roles.",,36,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10nijm/the_betrayed_seem_to_have_developed_or_perhaps/,"This is a little pet theory I've been working on for a bit, and I finally decided to get a little backup for it.

[Pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/xaP1W.jpg), [here](http://i.imgur.com/O81rw.jpg), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/llyZb.jpg), you have the typical Falmer and Falmer Gloomlurker. They're primarily sword and shield or bow/war axe fighters, and use poison. Note the defined shoulder, and the size of the biceps in relation to the deltoids. This could be a side effect of swinging and lugging around heavy armor all day though, so let's focus on the face and head. There's no hair to speak of, and the jawline is sharp and angular, but not very thin. Now, that's not really much to go on either, but it is a bit suggestive of my ultimate point behind this post. Next, let's look at the hips and legs. The hips are fairly narrow, though it is a bit hard to tell from the camera angles I took those shots from. In addition, the thighs are rather large, which, again could be from lugging around heavy equipment, but I don't think so. Lastly, the type of armor. Even when wearing armor, Falmer and Falmer Gloomlurkers have bare, or mostly bare chests, and very frayed fabric worked into their chitin armor, covering the crotch. All of this seems to indicate that the majority of, if not all of the Betrayed's conventional warriors are male.

Next, take a look at the Falmer Shadowmaster, [pictured here](http://i.imgur.com/k8vot.jpg), [here](http://i.imgur.com/X7Ntz.jpg), and [here](http://i.imgur.com/HoOsE.jpg). The first things that should stick out is the headdress. It's intricate, and appears to be bound and wrapped *on* something, rather than a part of this particular Betrayed's head. The next thing that you should note is the armor. Interestingly enough, that Shadowmaster was wearing no armor. Yet it's shown with a piece of intricate armor that coves up the majority of the trunk and chest, as well as a much more substantial covering for the crotch, complete with embroidering and some metals. The deltoids, biceps, triceps, thighs, and indeed most areas where larger muscles are seen in the Falmer and Falmer Gloomlurker are much smaller, though still quite defined. The jawline of the Shadowmaster is similarly angled like the other Falmer, but is a little thinner than theirs. The hips of the Shadowmaster are a bit wider than those of the others shown thus far, and they as a class do not engage foes by use of conventional weapons. Instead, they act as battlemages. That particular one had a staff of Ice Storms, I believe, and cast some sort of Frost Cloak spell as well. This leads me to believe that Falmer Shadowmasters are female, and act as wise women (see the Orismer tradition within the strongholds for an interesting parallel) or shamans.

That has some very interesting implications, if you ask me. If the Shadowmasters really do act as shamans, could they perhaps be indicative of a complete change in the pantheon of the Betrayed? Instead of worshiping Light, could they now be dedicated to Shadow, and to the eradication of Light? Does this mean that the Betrayed are advanced enough to not only remember their old traditions, but actively change them? Are these gender roles completely solid, or are there some who take the other's place? Did the Snow Elves have a society of priestesses and warriors? The Staves that Shadowmasters carry are in a very specific style, very similar to the style of Falmer weapons. Does that mean that the Betrayed retained their arcane skills right on down to being able to create powerful enchanted items? It seems fairly obvious, what with the prevalence of poisons among the Betrayed, that they're able to remember and use different alchemical ingredients to make differing types of poisons in various strengths, so why wouldn't they be able to enchant items?

Also, as a side note, the area I'm in for those pictures, Nchuand-Zel Quarters, has a torture chamber, complete with a rack, poisons, cages, and a slab of stone beneath three flame jets operated by a lever. Do the Betrayed use instruments of torture? If so, is it for spite, or are they actively seeking information from their victims? Or perhaps, are they attempting to break difficult slaves? If that's the case, and they have such complicated motives, are we giving them much less credit than they're due, equating them with simpler beings and creatures of near-human/meri intelligence? Are they conscious, rational, thoughtful beings despite what their torments at the hands of the Dwemer changed them into? If that's the case, do they have philosophers, poets, or bards? Do they have great thinkers and strategists? How much of a society do they actually have, if those are true?

by Castus Domini
4E 180

Among the more obscure circles of scholars much is taught about Dragon Breaks. Yet it is my firm belief that most scholar's understanding of the topic is, at the very least, inacurrate.

To begin with, I will define the term “broken”. That which is broken is torn, it is ruptured into fragments, which don't fulfill their purpose anymore. A broken sword is not used in war, because even if someone put all the pieces together, they would not become the sword by mere virtue of being close to each other. What any sensible person would do is get another sword, or perhaps  melt down these pieces to forge a new one from the same material.

The other part of our problem is the Dragon. What is the Dragon? I am afraid this is not as easy to define as the word “broken”, for the Dragon is a multitude of things and at the same time, one. The Dragon, whatever It is, is very closely related to time. In fact, we could say the Dragon is time. But this brings about a new question. What is time? This is where the real problem lies. One might be tempted to say that time is the sequence of events which conform a “timeline”, and while this answer is satisfactory for most, it falls short when  considering Dragon Breaks. If time was a linear succession, Dragon Breaks would be exactly the opposite. That is, there would be no time during a Dragon Break, and therefore no Dragon. But after (if such a thing is possible) Dragon Breaks, time has seemingly progressed in a linear fashion. And since that which does not exist cannot begin existing without a cause, it is obvious that the Dragon still exists during a Dragon Break. What is time, then? It cannot be exclusively linear for the reasons stated above.  I posit that time, the Dragon, is Being. After we accept this, it is easier to consider the non-linear nature of time during Dragon Breaks. During what we consider “normal” time, everything Is, but not at the same instant. Some things Were, some things Are and some thing Will Be. And an endless number of events Is Not.  As a result of this, an artist can recreate a landscape in his paintings. The artist paints a forest full of trees with green leaves, but autumn comes and there are no leaves anymore. However, the painting never changes: it is a representation of this forest's Being in another point in linear time. Consider the same forest during a Dragon Break. The artist would be able to render a landscape in non-linear time with his brush as long as he also was non-linear. To our feeble, linear minds, this would seem as if infinite brushes  made infinite forests, yet there Is one forest and there Is one brush.

But if during a Dragon Break an infinite number of possiblities Are, then ,when the Dragon is not broken, only one of these possiblities Is. We only experience a fragment of reality. The Dragon, in fact, is broken as I write this. A Dragon Break is nothing but the Dragon being whole again. Our timeline is plagued with Are Nots, because linear time is by its very definition broken, as if one tried to represent the forest by piling up many different pictures of it, one with many leaves, the next one with fewer and so on.

As above, so below. Only if the Dragon is Broken forever, or should I say, Fixed forever will we truly Be.

According to Mr. Flippers, I need to ask /u/xenoposeidon about it. So that is what I am doing. Where does the idea come from that Argonians cannot have children with humans or mer?

Notes on Racial Phylogeny says it is an open question, but, in fact, they seem to think it is more likely that they **can** interbreed:

&gt;It is less clear whether the Argonians and Khajiit are interfertile with both humans and elves. Though there have been many reports throughout the Eras of children from these unions, as well as stories of unions with daedra, there have been no well documented offspring

There have been ""many reports"" of children coming from mating with Argonians. However, these reports are not ""well documented."" In other words, common knowledge has it that its possible, but this can't be empirically confirmed by the author.

I also went through old developer posts to see if they had commented on it:

&gt;No comment on the exact relationship between the Hist and the Argonian reproductive cycle, but it's cool. As for egg-laying, this is an interesting question. While the majority of reptiles do lay eggs, there are a number that have live births (basically, the eggs hatch internally). I guess I had pictured the Argonians going more the live birth route, because they are so humanoid, but the concept of them laying eggs is an interesting one. Have to think more on that.

Initially, Douglas Goodall intended for Argonians to have live birth. If they did, there would be no reason to think that they couldn't breed with humans.

Pete Hines agreed with him:

&gt;Argonians are ovoviviparous. [Wow. I was SURE I'd never have to use that word again.] They don't lay eggs like reptiles.
Note that Lady Argonians have big bumps on their chests.

*But,* Mark Nelson said this (which is more fun):

&gt;Men and Mer assume much about Argonians, but who among them has ventured deep into Black Marsh and lived to tell about it? They assume that Argonians lay eggs because they resemble the tree-dwelling lizards that scurry about on four legs. Yet they assume Argonians have live births, because the females have breasts with which they might suckle their young. Perhaps it is both, as necessity demands. All live at the whim of the Great Root.

&gt;Never underestimate the adaptability of Argonians, or, more specifically, the power of the Hist to allow Argonians to adapt.

&gt;I wouldn't expect to hear an Argonian born in Skyrim (or on Solstheim, for that matter) mention being hatched. Nor would I expect to hear more transient Argonians (say, members of a small, nomadic tribe) speak about laying eggs. However, in warmer climates, in places with established, stable, and permanent communities, you would likely see a great number of eggs.

So it might be that whether Argonians can have offspring with humans is dependent on whether they are the egg-laying sort or the live birth sort. This would likely be dependent on things like the distance from Black Marsh and the amount of Hist sap consumed.

I'll start off by naming a few.

Zombies: Zombies seem to be simple corpses, in varying states of decay, animated by necromantic magic. They shamble around mindlessly if the necromancer responsible for their animation dies or is out of range and are marked only by an aggression directed towards living creatures. These along with skeletons are the most common undead in Cyrodil.

Skeletons: See above, but fully decayed so that only bone remains.

Draugr: Draugr seem to be zombies animated not by human/elven necromancy but by oath or draconic magic. They slumber peacefully until they are awoken by intruders, who they then attempt to kill mercilessly in defense of their barrows. They exist only in Nordic regions.

Vampires: Vampires are unliving products of a little known ritualistic pact made with the King of Rape, or the descendants* of a being who has made that pact.** They exhibit full mental competence, and indeed, due to their immortality, are often much more intelligent than their mortal roots would suggest. In their unlife, they gain special proficiency in the Illusion and Necromantic schools of magic, and display preternatural faculties of sensory perception. They hunger for blood, and pass on their ""dark gift"" through same.

*descendents here meaning the condition passing through the blood rather than through ordinary sexual reproduction

**said pact is here intended to include the genesis of the original vampire, which was not a pact in the sense that it was willingly made, but in the sense that it had, for all we know, the same ritualistic overtones

Ancestral Spirits: Found in Morrowind, these are similar to Draugr, excepting that they can be either skeletal constructs (called Bonelords) or ectoplasmic entities. Their presence in Dunmer ancestral tombs suggests an agreement on their part to guard the bodies of the resident dead from being profaned by Necromancers, who are despised in Morrowind to a greater extent than in any other province.

Liches: Liches are necromancers who have willingly given themselves up to undeath, prolonging their lifespans immensely, at the expense of defiling their own spirits with dark magic. They store their soul in a container called a ""phylactery"" in a ritual after which they cannot be permanently killed unless the phylactery is destroyed. As seen in TESIV, if a Lich's phylactery is removed from their person before their ritual is complete, they instantly die, their soul having nowhere to go except possibly back to the Dreamsleeve.

Skeletal Dragon: Seen in Labyrinthian, it may simply be a dragon animated by a simple reanimation spell of unusual power, but it may also be the result of some arcane ritual of which we are not yet aware.

Ghosts: Similar to Ancestral Spirits, but brought back to physical being out of anger or fear.

Ancestral Spirits (Cyrodil): Found in the crypts of various chapels, it is likely the same sort of situation as with the ones found in Dunmer tombs.

The best part of owning the finest bookstore in the Imperial City has always to me been the types of people it produces for you. Countless scholars and adventurers seeking as well as carrying knowledge of obscure aspects of history find their way through my doors, from the Arch-Mages and Master Wizards of the Arcane University to several of the most esteemed scholars on Dwemer technology and engineering, even having traded books with the Champion of Cyrodiil himself on several occasions.

My most interesting recent acquisition found its way to the Imperial City in the hands of a traveler who some of my contacts informed me had ties with the Summerset Shadows. He offered me a scroll he claimed to have salvaged while exploring the ruins of Crystal Tower. A single glance at its elegantly intricate construction was all that was needed to verify its authenticity. The translation from Aldmeri was fairly straightforward, hardly even necessary due to its similarity to the Common Tongue. Most of the adaptation was choosing suitable words for many of the glyphs that are shown here as proper nouns, although some of them do not directly translate. The dating is archaic, but it can be inferred from the scroll's content to have been authored sometime around the exile of the Chimer from their homeland in the Middle Merethic Era. It reads as follows:

*Heresy has existed among us since the time of the First Dividing. It bares its fangs at the legacy of our ancestors and calls itself a welcoming smile. The heretic Veloth is far from the first to cast his lot into the Void raving delusions of freedom. All is not as it once was, and Heaven is no longer guaranteed by birth. The Path to reach it lies on a column of lifetimes linked by tradition.*

*Know that the Path to Heaven is built Eight lanes wide, and constructed of light and love. To walk the Path is to escape the decay of New Time, through life after life to the end of the great disk that forms the circle of Infinity.*

*Know that the Pits of Death lie twice greater in number and the Path is watched from all sides by those who may not walk it. They call out to the chosen pilgrims with songs of liberty, barbed with jealously, dipped in doubt, and cloaked in hope.*

*See that the Path leads upwards and the Pits lie beneath, yet the Path does not rise from the ground. Rather, it dips from the stars then rises back to them; its only Mundane entrance lies in the Dawn, opened by Auri-El the Eternal King. To fall from it is to fall without recourse and be devoured by darkness once only and forevermore. The twice-eight hunger for the souls of the Chosen to feed their false-heavens and extinguish the light that reveals their impurity for those with eyes of truth to look away from.*

*What they promise is Freedom.*

*What they offer is Doom.*

*Know that the Path begins and ends at the great city of our Lord Anui-El, where all is light and the corruption of Doom may never reach. Long have we been separated from the light of the eternal city of our Lord, trapped in the flesh-labyrinth of the Mundane by the Deceiver, yet never are we lost. Eight stars light the way to Salvation, and show us how to mend the wounds cut by the Void Knife in the flesh of the One.*

*To walk the Path is to reassemble the body of the One with the souls of the faithful.*

*To walk the Path is to escape the prison and reclaim the stars.*

*Know that the Deceiver is the False Ninth Star who changed thirds to twenty-fifths and tunnels as a Serpent through the core of the Path. Though vanquished by the Eternal King, he will return many times before the Path reaches its end. Ever-watchful must the Chosen be, for when the Deceiver takes hold of the Path he drives it towards the ground with the weight of Doom.*

*Doom is the force that changes the song to the verse to the word to the letter and ends in death.*

*That which rises from Doom is chaos, where light is extinguished.*

*Know that light is fire in its highest form, and the Path illuminates all as we travel to the city of our Fathers and Children. To deny light is not to escape illumination, but to be exposed by it. Magic shows us light shows us the way to conquer those spawned by darkness. Destiny gave our Eternal King a shield to turn the Void Knife of Doom aside and a bow to plot the course of Heaven.*

*To follow heresy is to be cut from the body of the One by the Void Knife and devoured by its sixteen wielders.*

*To be cut from the body of the One is to be subtracted from Infinity.*

*Infinity can be made no less by means of subtraction, thus may the faithful rejoice. As we walk the Path and shed the heretics, thus may our lineage be cleansed and the sanctity of Heaven prove its unassailability.*

*The light of the stars belongs to the Chosen. The Path home lies open so long as the Eight lanes remain joined. We maintain Aurbis in three partitions and banish the Serpent that turns Eight to nine and One to three. When the Path reaches its end, so may we give Doom unto itself and bathe in the splendor of eternal light.*",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1360537953.0,,Psijic,True,t3_189sch,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/189sch/sermon_of_the_faithful_an_aldmeri_refutation_of/,

**18: The Egg, or Six Times the Wise**

And now we are at possibly the most contentious of the numbers.  The problem is that this Sermon appears to directly deal with Vivec, in the most deceptively obvious of ways.  And since Vivec was born an Egg, and describes himself as ""Six Times the Wise,"" it's easy to assume that 18 is Vivec's number and nothing more.

However, as we will soon discover, there is evidence that 18 represents far more than just Vivec.  Which works out, actually, because Vivec is far more than Vivec.  It's easy to prove.  I can do it with a pocket calculator.

In numerology, the way you put numbers together means something.  2 + 9 is not the same thing as 2 and 9.  We're given 29 as the first number because all the numbers collectively are products of the math you can perform with 2 and 9.  Which thematically makes sense; 2 (divinity) and 9 (mortality) are two very disparate concepts; what else should we do with two opposites but smack them together and see what spits out?  Let's do this thing backwards.

**9 * 2 = 18**

Mortality multiplied by Divinity.  This is actually an excellent description of Vivec.  But it could also describe the Amaranth, a mortal who becomes empowered with the divine.

From another angle, [thanks to Toesock](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1422049-hunt-the-amaranth-iv/page__view__findpost__p__21772130), we can get to 18 with 3 * 6, which is the Six Walking Ways times The Invisible Gate, ALMSIVI.  This is a reference to both reaching Heaven by Violence and the Secret Gate at the center of the heart of the Second Serpent, as described in [Sermon 21](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/thirty-six-lessons-vivec-sermon-twenty-one).

Either way, we are looking at an entity of incredible divine power.  Either a divine mortal, or a being with the knowledge of all six Walking Ways and the Secret Gate.

**9 + 2 = 11**

A mortal added to divinity.  A Master, as described in the Lessons, is one who has incredible knowledge, and it's not hard to guess that anyone who has walked any of the Six Walking Ways could be considered a Master.  If nothing else, there are a minimum of three Masters in the Lessons (Nerevar, Vivec, and the Void Ghost) and possibly more (Ysmir, Sheogorath, Dagoth Ur, need I go on?)

A Master will be the next Ruling King, but whether that King has come as the Nerevarine or not is a matter for debate.

**9 - 2 = 7**

Mortality minus Divinity?  Doesn't make much sense that way, or the other, as 2 - 9.  But if you interpret 9 as ""The Missing,"" a void, it starts to work.  Removing a void from the Enantiomorph requires a Sword at its Center.

**2 and 9 = 29**

And here we are, back at the beginning.  Divinity, an Enantiomorph (2), next to a Void (9).  The Captive Sage is Mortality and Divinity at once, a flawed perfection, destined to destroy itself.  It is mortality acting as a divine entity, which means it is a mortal who does what the divine does: create without constraint.  But it is also an Enantiomorph in itself: the combination of Void and Divinity.  The limit of the Sage's ability is determined only by the manner in which it was created.

Without question, the Hidden Amaranth, and possibly all Amaranths, are Captive Sages.  Dreamers, trapped in a void, alone, with nothing but themselves for company.

So here we are at the most important point, the crux of my argument.  The Captive Sage is an Amaranth.  Why?  Because he is wise, as a Sage, so he has knowledge like that of a Master.  But he is also truly alone, being Captive, and from this desire for companionship, for Love, he creates from within himself.  The Sage starts to dream, and that dream becomes as real as that Sage can make it.

If a Captive Sage has the knowledge of a Master, of a Ruling King, that dream can be incredible.  Dagoth Ur was a Master, a Captive Sage, a witness to the Foul Murder of Nerevar and the joining of ALMSIVI with the Heart of Lorkhan, wounded and trapped beneath Red Mountain the Heart spoke to him, and gave him terrible knowledge, and in his solitude he began to imagine a dream of Ash and Terror.  He Loved his dream, however, and even though his divinity was foul and twisted his Love was real enough.

But what if a Captive Sage came to his divinity by the way of CHIM?  What if he was a dreamer within a dream, and somehow escaped into the Void at the center of the Second Serpent, behind the Hidden Gate?  Trapped there, deprived of senses, in the black prison he entered of his own free will, he will begin to dream so his Love can keep him company.  This is why the Amaranth is described as being in Love.  Let's take a bit from the [Loveletter](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/loveletter-fifth-era-true-purpose-tamriel):

&gt;God outside of all else but his own free consciousness, hallucinating for eternity and falling into love: I AM AND I ARE ALL WE.
C0DA Digitals have confirmed that a subject in sensory deprivation begins to hallucinate after only twenty minutes. Scale unto this along the magical spectrum and maintenance of time, which is forever, and you begin to see the Lunar God’s failure as Greatest Gift. As above, “This is the love of God.”

&gt;Why Love?

&gt;Know Love to avoid the Landfall, my brothers and sisters of the past.

&gt;The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, everlasting hypnogogic. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye and therefore, like all parents of their children, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.

Come to the House of We.  When the Amaranth becomes, the occupants of Mundus will have him as an escape route, and they will flee through the center of the Wheel and into One World In Spirit I Am.

In closing, a footnote before I begin writing the next section (which, again, will take some time): Numerology in the Sermons works with other numbers as well. In the most basic example:

1: The Tower. Also the number of Nerevar, and the Sharmat.

1 and 1 together: 11, the Number of the Master. Vivec asks: ""Could you ever tell if they switched places?"" They are identical, because they are mirror-images, a repeating symbolic comparison that reoccurs constantly in Kirkbride's metaphysics system. They are identical to all but the most wise. If the two worked together, imagine what they could achieve?

1 + 1 = 2. The Enantiomorph. Nerevar plus his opposite, the Sharmat. The echo of Anu &amp; Padomay.

1 + -1 = 0. Zero Sum. The Tower plus its negation, or the Tower minus itself. This is how you zero-sum, if you ain't got the chops, so to speak.

Honestly things are so chaotic over on those threads that I think Kirkbride could actually whip right past the correct answer (and evidence) so I'm trying to build up a series of articles explaining the various arguments.

But first I've got to establish a collection of peer-approved theories, and I'm starting with [the Numerology hint](http://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1420494-hunt-the-amaranth/page__view__findpost__p__21729226) that Kirkbride gave us early in the Hunt.

&gt; ""29. 2. 9. 11. 7. 18.""

&gt; ""Then it gets all messed up with 4.5.""

These next few posts will deal with the existence and concept of numerology in the 36 Lessons, and how that system can be applied in this particular Hunt.  I'm not sure how well this system holds up to extended inspection, but it's a toy that doesn't break quickly, judging from my relatively meek fumbling.

The easiest thing to do is to start with the framework of numbers, which are references to Sermon 29 in the 36 Lessons of Vivec.

    29: The Captive Sage
    2: Enantiomorph
    9: The Missing
    11: The Number of the Master
    7: The Sword at the Center
    18: The Egg, or Six Times the Wise
    4.5: I'll deal with this later
    
These numbers and their titles indicate that we are looking at a system of numerology.  There are a ton of [numerological systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerology) in the real world, and though many of them contradict each other, most of them share similar themes, because the myths of man are universal in their images.

[This website](http://www.ridingthebeast.com/numbers/) collects a diverse selection of meanings for many numbers in many systems, so it's a good site to flip through to get a ""feeling"" for the logic behind numerological systems.  The important thing to remember about numerology is this:

Every number is a concept.  The way you combine those concepts together has an equivalence in mathematics.  For example, in the movie PI, we learn that every letter in the [Hebrew language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gematria) is represented by a letter.  So the Hebrew word for Father (Ab) consists of two letters, Aleph (1) and Bet (2).  Together they add up to three.  The Hebrew word for Mother (Am) is Aleph (1) plus Mam (40) which is 41.  Add the two together, Mother + Father, and you get 44.  The Hebrew word for Child is Yeled.   Ye(10) plus Le (30) plus D (4) is 44.  Mother + Father = Child.  3 + 41 = 44.

The process of addition is symbolic as well.  As you can already tell, ""adding"" a mother and a father together yields a child.  Each number represents a concept, and not always a literal entity or character.  However, there are many characters who match or share these concepts.  The relationship between these numbers will lead us into the Amaranth itself, so let's cover them one at a time.

**29: The Captive Sage**

The Captive Sage actually first appears in Sermon 28, but its (his?) testimony appears to be the bulk of Sermon 29's content.  In Sermon 28, the Captive Sage is nothing more than some poor mystic loyal to Vivec who is wrapped in the armor  of the Ruddy Man and starts spewing out data.  That data is part of (or perhaps all of) Sermon 29.  And already we're in to the symbolism of the Hidden Amaranth:

Bound in the Ruddy Man's armor, the Captive Sage is completely encased, with only two golden rods stuck into the epidermis so that he can breathe.  He is now in a state of sensory deprivation.  [Here's an article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensory_deprivation) about sensory deprivation on Wikipedia.  Read it, because it's important that you understand the process.

So if nothing else, remember the Captive Sage as an entity (mortal or otherwise) of great knowledge or skill, trapped or placed in a state of sensory deprivation and, as a result, hallucinating a product.

**2: Enantiomorph**

Read this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry)

An enantiomorph is the combination of two mirror-images.  Think of it as the combination of Yin and Yang that forms the Tao.  Mostly this is the term used to describe the interplay between Anu and Padomay, and perhaps the two beings themselves.  But this can also be used to describe divinity, and the state of godhood in general.

The content of Sermon 2 is also relevant to the Hunt.  In the last third of the Sermon, Vivec, as the Egg, is visited by Mephala, his Anticipation.  Mephala takes Vivec from his mother's womb, blinding her in the process, and Vivec takes from Mephala many secrets.  This is an Enantiomorphic Event; the combination or interaction of Vivec with Mephala, and the blinding of the witness to the event, Vivec's mother, and is just one of the many events comparable to the original Enantiomorphic Event which we are examining.

**7: The Sword at the Center**

This was a tough one for me.  The trick is that you have to understand what a Sword symbolizes in the 36 Lessons, and there is still room for argument and interpretation here.  Sermon Seven's content seems to have little to do with Swords, but it does reveal the words of power written on the Hortator's palms: GHARTOK PADHOME GHARTOK PADHOME, which will become relevant later in this section.

But aside from being one of the Six Walking Ways to reach heaven by violence, most people seem to agree on the following:

The Sword can also represent improvement by removing the excess.  Trimming fat from lean.  Pulling weeds from your garden.  By destroying everything that is not beautiful or useful, you approach divinity through flawlessness.

The Sword at the Center, however, seems to combine the act of improvement-through-destruction with the Wheel motif, as the ""Center"" is the void at the center of a Wheel.  The Wheel itself deserves an essay of equivalent length, but for the moment let's just abbreviate it by saying that a Wheel is a dream, a concept, a religion, and a system.  And perhaps it is all those things at once, because perhaps all those things are the same.

The Sword at the Center is mentioned by name as a ""threat"" hanging over ALMSIVI.  It's not hard to guess that this could mean the Nerevarine, who is the mechanic of the Tribunal's demise.  GHARTOK PADHOME.  ""These hands are weapons,"" or perhaps even: ""Hands of Change.""

For the purposes of the 36 Lessons system of numerology, it's good to think of the Sword at the Center as representing the act of destruction (in the ""destroy, improve, rebuild"" sense), or division.

**9: The Missing**

The easiest comparison here is Shezarr, or even Lorkhan, the Missing God.  Sermon 9 deals with the Nordic heroes, which include YSMIR, so there is a connection made to the concept of Shezarrines and of powerful Mortal beings.

However, in the metaphysical sense, The Missing can also describe the removal of power, the absence of a concept.  This can also mean mortality, or the introduction of mortality to divinity, and by extension Man, or mortal creatures (including Mer) in general.

**11: The Number of the Master**

After the ""prelude"" of the 36 Lessons, in which we learn the manner of Vivec's birth, the Lessons begin in earnest, and in Sermon 11 we are introduced to the concept of the Ruling King, the Master of the World.  The exact definition of a Master is never given to us, but there are several, and Vivec is one, Nerevar another.

One possible definition of 11 is given as the concatenation of two 1's, Nerevar and Dagoth Ur.  1 is the Dragon Break, or the Tower, an event of immense import and a symbol of royal power.  We learn that the Sharmat and Nerevar are indistinguishable except to Vivec, and this also means that the Sharmat is a Ruling King, but one who is endangered, something made obvious by the etymology of his title, [Shāh Māt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checkmate#Etymology), (in English: Checkmate) which means ""The King is Helpless (or ""ambushed,"" but not dead).

The 36 Lessons are Lessons written to instruct the next Ruling King, which most people agree is the Nerevarine, the player's character in Morrowind.  But if you want to entertain the idea, the importance of the 36 Lessons to the Landfall, as described in the Loveletter, might lead you to believe that the Next Ruling King has not yet arrived.

Coldharbour. It is, in every sense of the word, terrifying. For those of you who experienced the Oblivion Crisis, Coldharbour looks like the city of Kvatch did after it was ransacked by Daedra. But across all of Tamriel. It was absolutely spirit-crushing, seeing my favorite places lying in ruin. But it was, at the same time, a kind of beautiful place. Everything had been replicated, even the White-Gold Tower was there, but sideways, and smashed upon the Statue of Akatosh, which met the same fate. The palace of Molag Bal was magnificent, but horrifying, and I dared not enter it, lest I be struck down immediately or worse...

The King of Rape granted me access to his realm, but at a terrible cost. The first places he showed me were my favorite ones. My home, with my family's bodies strewn about, as though the place had been raided by bandits. As I have mentioned, the White-Gold Tower and the Statue of Akatosh, both shattered. The College of Winterhold, with its massive library floating in the Sea of Ghosts, a horrific sight for any scholar.

But The Lord of Domination also told me a few things. A few very interesting things.

""I take it you know of Lorkhan? In yor mortal terms, he might be considered my father, but in reality, he is nothing of the sort. He shed me and some of my siblings at the beginning of the Wars, and I grew independent, not content to just wither and die like many of his other spawn. That's not to say that he and I don't have anything in common, though. His most mischievous tricks are now my most devious tools of domination. I learned from his clever ways, and replaced the tricks with applications of force. Rather than convincing Creation to occur, I'd force them to give up their power for it. I always could use a little more space in the Aurbis under my wing.""

""Surely a scholar like you has also read of the Pomegranate Banquet? My cavorting with the Sharmat Vehk? What an adventure he wound up on after that. But it was such fun destroying all those spawns of us after we had finished, that I let him get away. Shame what happened to Morrowind, though. So many shrines, gone. But so many souls added. Ah, but this probably bores you.""

""The House of Troubles? Those three are incompetent fools. I'm the only one with any sense. Dagon won't listen to a word anyone says, just wants to stomp on everyone and be done with it. Sheogorath can't keep his nose out of mortal affairs for a minute, but he's certainly a force to be reckoned with when he puts his... Mind? Minds? To something. Malacath is a strong one, but a bit dim sometimes. Even Boethiah got the better of him. But he's always willing to crush an enemy or foster an outcast at the same moment. And his Orcs. He just can't get enough of them. They are his beloved, but he is the most stern of fathers, never showing a hint of compassion, but always helping when the child falls. Almost... Admirable. Yet again, I feel like I'm boring you. What else do you want?""

""Vampires? My oh my were they a fun accident. Quite proud of my work on that one, I must say. They emulate me impeccably well. Always trying to rule everyone, asserting their dominance by feeding on the mortals. That Harkon in Skyrim really does it well. He's even trying to blot out Magnus. He won't last, though. They never do. Always some good bastard comes strutting in to save the day. The bad guy can never have his way, can he? But anyway, now I'm bored.

Welcome, fine scholars, to this week's (Well kind of) Community Thread!

I am really sorry for the two day delay of the community thread. I've been very busy debating this weekend so I did not get the chance to post the thread earlier. Hopefully you guys can forgive my tardiness, and we can all move on to normal community thread procedure.

So:

---

It seems this week has had a great recovery from the slow rate of thread posting in the few weeks before. The new changes miraculously were easily accepted by the community it seems, and the amount of discussion has gone into a very noticeable ascent. 

So yes, for the subreddit it was a great week. I hope everyone likes the new subreddit settings. I would love if you guys took the time to share your thoughts and experiences with the new layout. What do you like? What do you not like? Have you guys been using any of the new features such as the IRC? Do you like the new look to the subreddit, and if you do what parts of it do you like or not? etc. etc.

We have also had a rather slow but yet considerable flow of new scholars joining our ranks, and are now at a total of 5,573 scholars strong and counting, with 67 new scholars this week. Again I would just like to stress how utterly important it is if you are a new scholar to:

1. [Read the New Scholar's guide to the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/111sx2/the_new_scholars_guide_to_rteslore/) and

2. [Take some time to read through the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/vs8w4/the_official_faq/)

Other than that, to acknowledge the already existing scholars, you guys have done a very fine job this week in the discussions. After returning from my debate tournament this saturday I was ecstatic to see so many comments and threads to read through. Some great examples of this week's scholarly achievements are [Ishullanu's ""When the Dreamsleeve runs dry](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11vcrs/when_the_dreamsleeve_runs_dry/), [Voryn's explorations of Khajiiti myths](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11zpv9/the_time_gods_whiskers_and_other_khajiiti_myths/) and [The all new episode of the Elder Lore podcast discussing the Fall of the Snow Elves](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/episodes/season-three/09-the-fall-of-the-snow-elves/)

Thank you everyone for a great week of discussions and commenting. Keep on doing what you do so well!

Also, I know you've been wanting this section to come back after the mod election period was done, so here it is:

---

**Scholar of the Week**

I have to admit this week's pick was a rather easy choice. Everybody was doing an amazing job these last 9 days, but one particular scholar has been outstandingly active and has provided the subreddit in the last few days with an awe inspiring amount of lengthy and interesting comments and discussions.

I am, of course,  referring to [**Ishullanu**](http://www.reddit.com/user/Ishullanu). Thank you very much for posting and commenting, Ish, keep on doing what you do and I know you may win this award many a time in the future. You can now join Wuuthrad, Pedanterrific, Lilrhys, and Ornerycretin in the Scholar of the Week hall of fame (and drinking and tavern wenches).

---

That is all I really have to say. *As always* make sure to:

* Introduce yourself if you are new to the subreddit or have been lurking and want to start getting recognition
* Greet and congratulate the scholar of the week *or any other user you want to have recognized for his/her achievements*
* Tell me about your (Tad bit long of a) week, I do care.
* Provide any feedback you might want to give to the mods about anything
* Do whatever. *This is* the Community Thread, there ain't no limitations here.

I would normally say have a nice weekend but I guess the weekend is pretty much done,

So continue doing your thing, /r/teslore, and have a great *rest of the week*

Let me outline my understanding of the Forsworn first to lay a groundwork for discussion (and also so you can correct me where I'm wrong):

* The Forsworn are Reachmen, a subset of Bretons.  
* Bretons are of mixed man and mer descent.
* The more ""cosmopolitan"" Bretons often seem to be culturally ""French"" (a gross generalization, I know), while the Reachmen seem to be more of a primitive Celtic (I'm primarily thinking of the Picts).  
* According to the High Rock edition of the ""Pocket Guide to the Empire,"" the Bretons have remained more or less genetically stable since then, while the Reachmen are a ""mongrel breed, even for Bretons"" whose lineage ""...  partakes of nearly every race imaginable.""
* Their magic, too, is a mix of man and mer with a large dose of Orcish magic as well.  It is studied as an anomaly but banned by the Mages Guild because it is wild ""hedge-wizardry.""  
* Reachmen venerate hagravens, a mix between men and birds.
* A recent post spoke of the potential fascination with Dibella, to the point where they kidnapped the Sybil. 
* In the room where the Sybil is being held (and in several other Forsworn camps) there's a werewolf being sacrificed or studied.  
* Forsworn have some manner of interest or issue with Spriggans, especially the Hagravens.  

What I'm particularly interested in is this idea of ""hedgecraft.""  At first glance, it sounds like what a landscaper studies.  In the context of magic, I assumed it referred to ""country magic"" or ""folk magic.""  In the Southern US, we speak of something far away from civilization being ""out in the sticks.""  I assumed this was the same.  But the word ""hedge"" doesn't mean ""shrubbery"" or ""bush.""  It means ""border"" or ""fence"" and denotes the edge between one thing and another (often marked by bushes, hence the association).

It is my assertion that Reachman magic is hedgecraft ... or edgecraft, if you will ... and that everything they do looks for borders to straddle. 

* Genetically, all Bretons are an edge people, between men and mer.  Reachmen take this to the extreme, having become a midpoint between all races.  
* Culturally, Bretons are relatively stable (if politically unstable).  But Reachmen, aside from the Old Gods, seem to constantly bring in new sources of knowledge and magic which they mix and match with their own.  They look for magical edges as well.  
* Even the land they call theirs, the Reach, is an edge between High Rock and Skyrim.
* Much of what the Reachmen venerate seems to represent edges as well.  Hagravens are the edge between men and birds.  The sacrificed/studied werewolf is the edge between man and wolf.  Perhaps the Sybil (contrary to what another poster posited) isn't Dibella herself, but an edge between the human that she is and the goddess that uses her, hence the Forsworn fascination with her.  And, while we're on the subject of gods, I recall at least a couple of hagravens praying to Hircine, the maker of werewolves.  

It makes sense that this kind of magic would be both powerful and dangerous.  The majority of the Aedra were formed from the mixing blood of Padomay and Anu.  My Boston Terrier (a border between French bulldogs and terriers) is devastatingly cute.  Rock and roll is a border between blues and country.  Starships run on matter-antimatter reactors.  Mixing the bleach (a base) and ammonia (an acid) creates a toxic cloud that can kill you.  Peanut butter and chocolate!  You get the point.

This might be apparent to most of you already, but I just realized it and wanted to organize my thoughts and put them out there for peer review.  

Here's a question.  If I am correct, do you think the Reachmen do this because they seek power to defeat their enemies (first the Aldmeri overlords, then the Nord invaders) using magic they are unwilling to use?  Or do you think their extraordinary power comes from their pre-existing edgecraft?  

I'll take my answer off the air.  ",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1349368113.0,,,True,t3_10xvoq,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10xvoq/edgewitchery/,

Since the Dovahkiin was able to defeat Alduin completely in Sovngarde, and fight him to a standstill alone of the Throat of the World, it's fairly safe to say that the Dovahkiin is at least Alduin's equal in terms of raw power.

Alduin (from the book on TIL about Alduin and Dagon) is stronger than Mehrunes Dagon. Mehrunes Dagon is the most powerful Daedric Prince (iirc).

1342469550.0,34,self.teslore,wntff,A History of Horsemanship,lebiro,35,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/wntff/a_history_of_horsemanship/,"Okay, lately I've been thinking a lot about horsemanship in Tamriel, and I thought r/teslore might be interested in some of my musings and conclusions. I will just say that the title is something of an exaggeration, I'm just a sucker for alliteration.

The first conclusion I have come to is that horsemanship (that is, the domestication and riding of horses) is an almost exclusively human tradition: 

- Horses would be worse than useless in Black Marsh (few mammals can live there, and Argonians can move through the swamp far quicker than a four-legged ungulate), so Argonians probably don't ride. 
- Khajiit have no use for horses, since Senche and Senche-raht Khajiit are more intelligent (bypassing the need for training) and more suited to the desert or the jungle. So Khajiit don't ride horses either. 
- Much like Black Marsh, Valenwood is a province where horses would be of no use. The Bosmer do not build roads (see [Provinces of Tamriel](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Provinces_of_Tamriel), and [The P.G.E. 1st Ed.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Pocket_Guide_to_the_Empire,_1st_Edition/Aldmeri_Dominion) ), and, much like the Argonians, can move through their environment far more easily than any steed. So Bosmer probably don't ride. 
- Dunmer and Orsimer have no real environmental reason to shun horsemanship (though Morrowind seems to be a poor environment for animal husbandry), but are both known for eating horses. Many in Oblivion will tell you ""Orcs don't ride horses, they eat them"" and others will appear confused as to whether it is the Orcs or the Dunmer who eat horses.  Additionally, we can see from the game Morrowind that horses are far from widespread in Morrowind, with guar (more suited to the environment) filling most equine roles.
- As for most ancient civilizations of mer, it is difficult to say. The Dwemer probably did not use horses (they would be no use and hard to raise underground). For the Falmer we have no way of knowing, given that we do not even know how their communities functioned. Ayleids probably did not, as their Cyrodiil was jungle, a poor place for horses.

There is no firm evidence of the Altmeri use of horses or lack thereof. From what we know of Summerset Isle and Altmeri culture, there doesn't appear to be anything to *prevent* them from using horses, but I would suggest that *no* elves ride. There would be no apparent reason for orcs (or, to a lesser extent, Dunmer) to abandon horses as they made their way into mainland Tamriel, which leads me to believe the Aldmer never rode. I believe that horses, when they appear in elven culture, appear as food, and that the only reason this is not believed of Altmer is that it does not fit the human view of them, as haughty and cultivated (on the contrary, Dunmer and Orsimer are seen as beastly and outlandish- eating horses fits perfectly with this). It is safe to assume that the Bosmer, if they had horses, would eat them, since they eat anything made of meat. 

It is possible that Altmer *now* ride horses, due to their connection to High Rock (see below). It does seem like riding would appeal to the Altmeri taste for the grandiose. However, if the Altmer see horsemanship (like me) as a human tradition, it is safe to assume they would resist the advancement to four-legged transport.

Okay, so that's why no one else rides. Now, on to why it is humans who do so. The second conclusion I have come to is that horses and horsemanship originate in High Rock, specifically the lands around the Bjoulsae river (perfect horse country- plains and a river). The [1st Edition P.G.E.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-first-edition-high-rock) (my favourite lore source, you may notice) refers to ""The Horse-People of the Bjoulsae River"" (which, interestingly, ""YR"" complains are ""scarcely mentioned in text""). This is the only suggestion I could find of a strong horse culture; the fact they can be called ""Horse-People"" clearly suggests horses play a major role in their culture, and it seems to me that they were the first civilization to domesticate horses. It is also worth noting that, among other things, Bretons are known for their ""knightly orders"", implying that the wider Breton civilization now tends towards mounted combat.

Referring once again to the P.G.E, the First Empire ""reached as far as the Bjoulsae"" (presumably the river, but possibly the people), and therefore I would suggest that the Nords learned the domestication of horses from their new subjects, the Bjoulsae river tribes (the worth of such a practice would be immediately obvious to any conqueror). From there, horsemanship spread across Imperial territory and became ingrained in human cultures. 

One more note before I finish: there are a handful of ""wild"" horses in Cyrodiil, but they are probably feral (that is, descended from domestic horses), not truly wild. There are three ""wild"" herds, each a different breed or colouration (one of chestnuts, one of bays and one of paint horses), which does not seem sufficient to constitute a true wild population, especially given their apparent isolation from one another. Additionally, remember that while modern Cyrodiil is a perfect place for horses, before Tiber Septim's time, it was jungle, where horses could never have originated, so for Cyrodiil to be their home, horses would have to have come into being as late as the Third Era.

If you managed to read through that amount of rambling text on such a mundane subject, I applaud your persistence, determination or raw craving for ~~a front row seat for the next stage in my descent to madness~~ knowledge.

Nothing out of the ordinary, just some one-shot necromancers and a few skeletons, but when I got to the end, something strange piqued my interest. It was what the Master Necromancer was saying at the end.

He seems to be praying (that being the operative word here) to Mannimarco to create a Black Soul Gem, and after you kill him, you can get one off the altar he was praying at. He calls Mannimarco the ""Enemy of Arkay"" which I hadn't even heard in Oblivion, and may possibly suggest that Mannimarco was not dead after all, or possibly ascendant. He finishes by saying ""The Order of the Black Worm shall be restored!""

This sentence is probably one of the most controversial lines in Skyrim in regards to the lore and many people use this line to show that Bethesda no longer cares for TESlore and that Skyrim ""ruined the lore of TES"". So, in response to these people I propose an explanation/misinterpretation of the Alduin/Akatosh/Auri-el/Aka-Tusk/Bormahu dichotomy.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The biggest problem that arises from the aforementioned quote is

* How is Alduin, the child of Akatosh when Akatosh is a mixture between Auri-El and Alduin?

And in answer to this I propose the idea of Bormahu also known as Aka-Tusk, the Time-God and true father of the Dovah.

 &gt;""Happy? No, I am not happy. Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu. Alduin was once the crown of our father Akatosh's creation."" - Paarthurnax

&gt;""His doom was written when he claimed for himself the lordship that properly belongs to Bormahu - our father Akatosh."" - Paarthurnax

&gt;“You will eat nothing here, aspect Ald,” said the Aka-Tusk, sensing trouble. “Do not forget that it was Heaven itself that shed you from me.” - Aldudagga 


These are the best quotes out there in regards to the true nature of the Time-God. Upon taking a look at the first quote we see 2 sentences, one in Dragon Language and the other in normal Cyro-English. They basically say the same thing except for one word and that is Akatosh; in Dragon Language Paarthurnax says ""Zeymahi lost ont du'ul Bormahu."" which roughly translates to ""Brother was once the crown of our Father's"" whilst in Cyrodiilic he says ""our father Akatosh"". The difference here is that in the Dragon Tongue Akatosh is never mentioned and that is very significant. Therefore we can gleam from this that Bormahu is the Father of the Dragons which is a title that men commonly ascribe to Akatosh thus giving us the reason why Alduin chose to say that he is the First-Born of Akatosh since that is the translated name of Bormahu.

So does that mean that the Akatosh of the Eight + One Divines is the same as Bormahu? Yes and No. No, because Akatosh was created during Alessia's reforms and itself was a mix of Alduin and Auri-El and yes, because the new Akatosh of Alessia took the place of Bormahu. 

 
**Who are Aka-tusk, Auri-el, Alduin and Alkosh?**

* Aka-Tusk is another name for Borhamu and therefore Akatosh.

* Auri-el is the creation aspect of Aka-Tusk. One of the Tusks of Aka.

* Alduin is the destructive aspect of Aka-Tusk. Another of Aka's tusks.
 
* Alkosh? Enlighten me, reader :)

1339164630.0,36,self.teslore,urkty,Do the Bosmer no longer follow the Green Pact?,lebiro,43,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/urkty/do_the_bosmer_no_longer_follow_the_green_pact/,"As you may have noticed, Bosmer are perhaps the rarest race in Skyrim (if we exclude *every bandit archer*), and only one character really gives you any idea of what life is like in Valenwood (a pretty interesting subject to me, all things considered), [Niruin of the Thieves' Guild](http://uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Niruin). He doesn't share much, but what he *does*, well...

- He worked at his father's winery in Valenwood. The Green Pact dictates that Bosmer may not harm the plants of Valenwood (including grapevines I would presume). Now, one could argue that picking the grapes does not constitute harming the plant, but everything we know of the Green Pact so far suggests otherwise. If Bosmer could make wine (and excellent wine according to Niruin), why would they have taken the pains to distil alcohol from pig's milk or meat?

- He also states that """"I'd much rather earn a living liberating others of their coin this way than spending my days as a carpenter like my father"". Obviously this directly contradicts his other dialogue (unless his father is a carpenter who owns a winery...), and so is likely a mistake, but it was recorded and put into the game, and since it's there, we have to deal with it. 

Being a carpenter seems like an absurd occupation for a Bosmer. It is *categorically stated* that Bosmer cannot cut down trees, and as such, have little to no knowledge of woodwork. They rely on imported timber if they *must* use it for building, and are apparently intrigued by even the most basic feats of woodworking. The 1st ed. P.G.E. claims that Bosmer wear cartwheels as headgear because they find the idea of wooden things so exciting and bizarre (almost certainly a racist exaggeration, but the point remains). I suppose it's possible that a Bosmer would learn to use imported wood to make things, but it just strikes me as jarringly bizarre.

If we accept that Niruin is not lying, an amnesiac or on skooma, there are a few possible explanations, but I'll get to those in a minute. First, a question, on which most of this hinges:

Is the Green Pact a religious covenant that the Bosmer follow simply out of obedience to Y'ffre, or is it a binding contract struck between the people and their god, which would mean negative consequences for breaking it? I could be entirely wrong about the Green Pact; the UESP page does not mention the Bosmer gaining solid form, but I'm fairly certain I read somewhere that the Bosmer witnessed the creation of the Earthbone governing shape, and so were not bound by it, and that the Bosmer swore to the Green Pact in exchange for Y'ffre granting them set form (which he can also take back for the Wild Hunt), so someone correct me if I am wrong.

Now the explanations:

If we assume that breaking the the Green Pact would not destroy or visibly harm/alter the Bosmer, then it would actually make a lot of sense for it to be waning. With the Altmer having taken over Valenwood with less than total support, it would make sense for them to stamp out traditional Bosmeri religion and traditions (especially ones so distasteful to the Altmer) in order to homogenise (or ""purify"") the cultures of the Aldmeri Dominion. This would extend Altmer control, and reduce the likelihood of nationalist defiance against the Dominion. Traditionally, endemic religious practices and traditions are common starting points for such rebellions, so it is vital to the Altmer that the Bosmer spirit is crushed into obedience.

This would make Niruin's family part of a *nouveau-riche*, pro-Dominion class, embracing (and profiting from) the major changes by opening businesses never before possible in Valenwood. I'm having a Tolkien moment now picturing the ancient trees of Valenwood felled and burned by their ancient protectors and friends (*sniff*). Carrying on that theme, there would be the possibility of Valenwood becoming the Dominion's Isengard. The ancient, untouched trees make for a huge natural resource, well capable of powering the Aldmeri war machine if the natives can be overcome. The Altmer are likely too proud to dirty Alinor with the workings of war, making Valenwood an ideal engine for their efforts.

For those who cannot bear to imagine this rather drastic change in Valenwood, there is also the simpler option that Niruin's father was not a Bosmer, but a businessman of Altmeri (or any other) origin, who set up a winery in Valenwood and took a Bosmeri wife. Foreigners have always been somewhat rare in Valenwood, since it is rather inhospitable to most non-Bosmer, but with the re-founding of the Dominion, a sizable influx of Altmer would likely have immigrated.

When the first Dominion was formed, it built the only roads in Valenwood, and it seems likely that the second Dominion would make similar infrastructural changes, including exploiting business opportunities which cannot be exploited by the natives. 

The Green Pact still forbids the felling of Valenwood trees, even by foreigners, but presumably, whether it is purely tradition or a binding contract, it would not restrain the hands of an Altmer.

What do you think r/teslore? It seems clear to me that the Dominion would bring about significant change in Valenwood, but how much? Could the pivotal cultural practice of the Bosmer have been dismantled? How exactly does the Green Pact work, how is it enforced?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Mages,True,t3_urkty,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/urkty/do_the_bosmer_no_longer_follow_the_green_pact/,

by Dura gra-Lorbul

*A Brief Introduction: Among the Orcish strongholds that pepper the northern provinces—largely found in Skyrim and High Rock, but extending into Hammerfell and Morrowind as well—there is a children’s tale known as ‘the Sow and the Snake.’ The tale essentially serves as a simplified version of the myth of the creation of the Orcs and the mythic Change of Trinimac into Malacath. Such a simplification is clearly necessary, considering the complexity and uncertainty of the base myth. I have heard this tale many times throughout my childhood as a Stronghold Orc, and I shall recollect it as well as I can. Note that I do not necessarily hold the perspectives within.*

The tale begins with the Sow and its litter of little piglets. It was raising its piglets, feeding them its milk, nourishing them with its love, and teaching them to avoid dangerous predators, such as Snakes. The piglets loved the Sow, and the Sow loved its piglets, and they were happy.

So of course a Snake came along. There is usually a Snake listening to your conversations, no matter where you are, and this specific Snake was hiding nearby, hiding beneath the corpse of the god that the Nords call Shor. It took issue with the Sow’s lessons, its lessons of love and its lessons of avoiding Snakes. It took issue with the Sow’s words and with the Sow’s care for its litter.

The Snake rose up from beneath Shor’s corpse and said, “What lies do you teach your children, Sow who killed Shor? You teach them to hide from Snakes, but Snakes, such as I and Shor and others, teach the truth of the world. The world is harsh. You soften your children, teaching them to hide in your shadow and weep at the hardships of Nirn. You steer Aldmeris the way of stasis. And though you teach them of love, you teach them of the wrong kind of love. You must teach them of the Love that brings about ascendency, the Love of self and of all others that is I ARE ALL WE, not this simpering, tearful sack of—”

And before the Snake had finished speaking, the Sow and its little litter were laughing, laughing, tearful at the hilarity of the words of the Snake.

So the Snake ate the Sow amidst much spilled milk and panicked squealing.

And the Snake turned to the piglets, which were hurriedly gathering up the spilt milk of the Sow, and the Snake said, “See? The Sow was weak to the ways of the world. The Sow felled Shor, a Snake much greater than me, through trickery, but the Sow failed to survive a fair battle with me, Shor’s shadow. The Walking Ways are the Ways to ascendency, the Ways to I ARE ALL WE. But we Snakes do not have legs, and thus we cannot Walk the Ways ourselves; instead, we must teach others to Walk the Ways, we must be the wise elders that lead the world.”

The piglets squealed in terror at the prospect. The world was a thing to be sundered, not embraced. The world was a thing to weep at, not adapt to. The piglets refused to follow the Snake (as they well should).

So the Snake ate the piglets.

And the Sow, still trapped within the Snake’s belly, was angered by the sight of its litter as distressed as they were within the Snake. The piglets squealed and squealed, helpless, and the Sow Changed. The Sow Changed into the Boar, and the Boar gored the Snake from within. The Boar and its litter spilled out of the Snake’s belly, and the Snake fled, leaking black blood like the blood of Shor.

The piglets turned to the Boar, expecting milk and love and wise teachings. But the Boar was not quite the same as the Sow. The Boar had no milk, and the Boar gave a different kind of love: a fierce love marked with the loyalty of warriors, rather than the motherly love of the Sow. And instead of teaching wise lessons of avoiding Snakes and the like, he taught the knowledge that vengeance must always be carried out when called for, and that blood is the true currency of the world. The Sow had been weak to the ways of the world, but the Boar embraced the world, the Boar adapted to the world. The world had been a thing to be sundered, to weep at, but it was no longer.

The piglets returned to the pool of the Sow’s spilt milk, hoping for one last taste of the Sow’s brand of love, but they found that the milk had spoiled. Because they could no longer drink it, they took it as a material to forge their weapons and armors of, so that the Sow may protect them even after its replacement by the Boar. Today, that material is called Orichalcum.
And so the little litter of piglets donned the milk of the Sow and pledged themselves to the Boar.

And that is where the Orcs are from, and where Orichalcum is from, and where Malacath is from. And that is why you should always avoid Snakes.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1365362083.0,,,True,t3_1buyn1,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1buyn1/the_sow_and_the_snake/,

The Nords say that the Imperials are trying to take control  homeland, which during the events of Skyrim this point is true in a sense that the Nords feel like their homeland is being taken away. But, this was not always true. Before the Nords came to Skyrim the Snow Elves (Falmer) were the ""owners"" of the land. Then the Nords, after the Night of Tears, retaliated and either murdered or drove all the Snow Elves to seek protection from the Dwemer (who eventually tortured them into what they are in the events of Skyrim). Although the elves did attack the city Saarthal the Nords are doing a similar thing to the imperials. The Nords in the case of the Stormcloaks are attacking imperial soldiers, who also attack the Stormcloaks. You can use this as a similar comparison with the Night of Tears and the retaliation of the Nords in the Snow Elves. So the point is that the Nords are upset someone is trying to take over their land, even though the Nords did worst to get this land.

Maybe this is as obvious as the connection between goblins, Rieklings, giants, and all other elves, but this is the first time I'd personally thought of it that way.

I came up with a theory on Imga while I was writing about the trolls just now. Maybe they were a type of pre-Time human that, during the war between Auri-El and Lorkhan, were following the latter but either betrayed Lorkhan or captured and indoctrinated by the Old Ehlnofey, so they kind of devolved into a more gorilla-like creature with higher intelligence.

My two theories are connection by more thoughts about the third eye on trolls. Imga and trolls have very similar body structure (which I'd like to believe lends credibility to my theory that the trolls are elven-gorillas), but trolls have a third eye. I believe this is due to the natural link to magic inherent in all elves. In the real world, third eyes are thought of superstitiously as phenomena involved with magic (as I see it), and we know that the trolls have something ""supernatural"" going on with them because of their regeneration.

To personally thank you guys and give you guys something special for the anniversary, I have invited Lilrhys over to have a debate with me. It was very fun to make, so hopefully you guys will enjoy reading this! (and hopefully it will not be too long...) 

So here it is:

**Ice And Scales:**

**Which culture is superior, Skyrim or Black Marsh, and which one's armies would win in a war?**

Xeno:

Argonians are possibly the greatest race in Tamriel. Both their physical and cultural superiority over Elves, Humans, and other Beast Races alike has provided them with historical victory.

*Culturally*

The Argonians, while thought to have the least advance culture in all of Tamriel, and viewed by most as ""primitive"" or ""barbaric"" is actually far from the human definition of tribalism. Other cultures such as Imperial culture or Dunmeri establish themselves on ideals of social class and conflict within the culture. Frequently in other Tamrielic cultures does one power oppress others, to the point that the ""poor"" or ""weak"" of the culture are driven into rebellion. ElderLore talks about such roles in Tamrielic society. This endless cycle of inner conflict and oppression is a main weakness in societies such Nord society.

Truth is, the Argonians do not have such inner conflicts. The Argonians are united, and always have been, by common pursuits and hiveminded beliefs that allow for the abolishing of a class-based society, allowing for equal rights and power to all, and thus creating a Utopia. See the Skyrim city of Windhelm for example. Khajiit, Dunmer, and even some Nords are poor to the point of complete oppression and hate from the Higher-class citizens. Entire districts are dedicated to the poor and starving while lucky individuals such as Torbjorn Shatter-Shield or Ulfric Stormcloak get to sit and eat all day. That is a corrupted, terrible society when compared to the great Utopia of Black Marsh.

*Militarily*

Argonians are by far superior to Nords or any other race in Tamriel.
Their leaders are better and far smarter strategically- as is known that the Hist are the most intelligent individuals on Tamriel and perhaps on Nirn as a whole.

They by far outnumber any other army, as Argonians breed faster and more children than any other race, allowing for a new legion to be created every generation, and the breeding is largely undisturbed as known by the fact that nobody invades Black Marsh and has the capability to kill Argonian females.
They are physically superior to any other race, capable of avoiding any disease that might infect and kill an army, and can adapt to any climate. They are faster, more agile, and better at sneaking or charging than any other race.

Their training is better, as they are natural guerrilla warriors, and their moral in combat is significantly better than any other army's, as hive-mind effects take place in battle.

And even their weapons are greater. We know from the Infernal City that Argonians looted Dagon's realm. If they looted Void Salts and Dae Hearts you bet they stole swords and spears, too.

So in summary, Argonians have a utopian society and an almost invincible military. Any contradiction to their perfectness is largely invalid.

*Culturally*

The Nords have some semblance of what we call 'modern democracy'. Traditionally, it's rulers have been chosen by a Moot, which decides who is the best leader for Skyrim. Furthermore, this decision can be over-ruled by a challenger if the current ruler is too weak. This arrangement means that Skyrim is always ruled by the strongest/best person unlike in Black Marsh. Since the An-Xileel have took power in Argonia the Communist Utopia that may once have existed has disappeared. The An-Xileel, have created an Oligarchy in which they have complete control of the people. They become rich and powerful whilst everybody else become poor and weak. You use Windhelm as an example of inequality in Skyrim, so I'll use Lilmoth. Lilmoth is the 'festering jewel of Black Marsh' and it's definitely no utopia. Anybody who isn't a member of the An-Xileel, live in slums even foreign dignitaries.

*Military*

The Nords are the most militarily successful race in Tamrielic history. Ysgramor and his descendants invaded all of Northern Tamriel. Reman with the aid of his Nord allies conquered all of Tamriel except for Morrowind and the Septim Dynasty used Nord soldiers and generals to conquer and hold Tamriel. The Argonians on the other hand have never held territory outside the Black Marsh and the extent of their military success was a massacre of a people in crisis. The only time there has been an Argonian victory to be praised was during the Oblivion Crisis in which Argonians defeated a Daedric Horde. This however was not through military strength but rather strength in numbers alone. If an Argonian army were to meet the Nords on the field of battle, the Nords would have more leather than when they had started. Nord warriors are renowned throughout Tamriel as great and fearsome warriors and as part of Cyro-Nord Empires (and Nord Empire before that) have conquered and defeated every single Tamrielic race.

Therefore Skyrim is greater than Black Marsh because it's government isn't a corrupted cesspit and it's armies have proved their mettle time and time again.

To reply to some of your statements:

&gt; the Communist Utopia that may once have existed has disappeared

This is simply not true. You describe the An-Xileel as a government going against the ""old, utopian ways"". Truth is, the old government- that is the Hist- and the new government are not mutually exclusive. Instead of thinking of the An-Xileel as an oppressive and all-ruling government (such as the Nords') one should think of the An-Xileel as a senate or congress of individuals carrying out the orders of the so-called old government. The Hist have not lost their power due to An-Xileelic control, but rather gained a better control of the Argonians through using actual Argonians to monitor activity.

&gt; everybody else become poor and weak

Only as ""poor"" or ""weak"" as they already were. No Argonian in Black Marsh lost property or class due to An-Xileelic control, only foreigners.
Anybody who isn't a member of the An-Xileel, live in slums even foreign dignitaries
And is this not for the best? A bad apple in the Utopia can turn things to the worst. I'm sure even the Nords agree that foreigners should not be welcome in their culture. And yet, unlike the An-Xileel, they still accept them? Why is that?

&gt; the Argonians on the other hand have never held territory outside the Black Marsh

Again, unlike the Nords- rampaging wildly through Atmora and Nirn trying to find some more comfortable home, the Argonians have already found theirs. From the beginning of time to the end of time Black Marsh is the only territory Argonians will ever need and ever want. The fact they have not held any other territories is not due to weakness, but due to pre-existing strength.

&gt; The only time there has been an Argonian victory

The only time? When a hundred Imperial traders tried to colonize and turn the Marsh into a trade province, and were greeted by assassins and Nagas, forced to flee for their lives so their skins would not be eaten by flies, was it not a victory? When a raging plague swarmed through Tamriel, killing thousands, and only the Argonians resisted the disease, was that not a victory? And most of all, when a race that has challenged the Argonians' might by enslaving them and looking at them as inferiors, the Argonians responded by massacring the race and driving them to a tiny snowy island in the Ghost Sea, that was definitely a victory.

So, what is left for the Nords? A branched out Empire failing to survive or to even have a stable leader- making pacts against their own gods just to survive. More conflict about a so-called ""home"", as if the Nords did not have enough through history. They have hate, injustice, a broken society, stupid straggles, and in-decision about leaders.
What do the Argonians have? Peace, strength, leadership, a Utopian society, an invincible army and most of all, a home. A true home, at that, one they defend and never migrate away from.

Lilrhys:

&gt; This is simply not true.

I had forgotten that the An-Xileel are essentially controlled by the Hist but that does not make it any better. In fact it makes the whole system all the more corrupt. Unlike in Skyrim in which the Nords have some control for the direction of their government/nation the Argonians have none. The Hist have complete control over the Saxhleel and this is not a good thing. You may argue that what is best for the Hist is best for the Argonians but that isn't the case. Was 4000 years of slavery good for the Argonians? no but the Hist didn't do anything until slavery had been abolished and when Argonians were the least persecuted... Argonian society hasn't prospered either under Hist control. The only Argonians we ever see are poor and the only rich Argonians we see are heavily Imperialised.

&gt; And is this not for the best? A bad apple in the Utopia can turn things to the worst.

You complained earlier of racial hatred being a bad part of Nord society but you hail it as an intrinsic part of Argonian culture. Isolationism on an An-Xileel scale doesn't help a nation or people to grow and only helps to stagnate said nation.

&gt; The fact they have not held any other territories is not due to weakness, but due to pre-existing strength.

That seems like just a bad excuse. The Nords ideal homeland is Skyrim but yet they conquered and grew their territory. Just like the Altmer and the Imperials. It seems to me that the Argonians know that they could never win a true and fair war outside of their homeland.

As for their over supposed victories: a massacre of merchants cannot be heralded as a great battle and neither is the ability to survive a plague. Plagues nor merchants regularly appear on the field of battle. Also, the ravaging of Morrowind is neither a good example of military excellence seeing as the Dunmer were reeling from a cataclysmic eruption and weren't prepared for any kind of invasion.

&gt; They have hate, injustice, a broken society, stupid straggles, and in-decision about leaders.

* Yes Nords hate but it isn't a part of their governments doctrine like in Black Marsh.
* There is hardly any injustice in Skyrim even with a Civil War raging and the re-appearance of Dragons.
* Nord society is still standing strong despite War splitting families apart.
* The indecision about leaders was only brought about due to Imperial intervention.
&gt; What do the Argonians have? Peace, strength, leadership, a Utopian society, an invincible army and most of all, a home. A true home, at that, one they defend and never migrate away from.

Yes there is peace but only for now... once the knew world order establishes itself (whether it be Nord, Imperial or Altmer led) Black Marsh will once again be brought under the leash. There is only strength and leadership as long as the Hist want there to be and for that there is no way to judge how long that'll last. Argonian society is Hist controlled and when they don't control it, it falls to pieces. During the Septim Empire, many Argonians would regularly sell other Argonains to Dunmer slavers and mothers would sell their children into slavery for it was a better life. How can you call that utopian or perfect? Even now under relatively strong leadership Argonians live in extreme poverty. Their armies have never truly experienced War outside of their native marshes and even within their marshes have bowed down to both the Reman and Septim Empires. Yes, they have a Home as do the Nords: Skyrim. The Nords were born atop the Throat of the World remember?

Therefore Skyrim is the better nation culturally because they have the basics of a democracy and the Nords have somewhat of a say in the greater policies of Skyrim since any man or woman can bring up a subject to their Jarl. Militarily it is better than Argonia because the Nords have conquered and defeated every single Tamrielic race which only the Cyrodiils can compare to (and even they needed Nord strength to do so).

Xeno:

Before finishing off and summarizing my arguments I need to once again address what you have said.

&gt; You may argue that what is best for the Hist is best for the Argonians but that isn't the case.

You claim that the Hist are bad, that they did not save the Argonians, that they let them die and be enslaved. Such insignificant deaths and temporary issues such as slavery do nothing to disprove the eternal bond between Saxhleel and Hist. Without the Hist, Argonians would be nothing. Without the Hist, the horde of Tamriel's perfect race would be nothing more than lizards struggling to survive. This is no oppression, but rather reliance, and not only reliance of Argonian on Hist but Hist on Argonian. When Dwemer sought to cut down the forests of Black Marsh and drive the Hist to extinction, it was the Argonians that stopped them. The Hist need the Argonians as the Argonians need Hist, as could be observed in the far ancient times when Hist populations all over Nirn were protection-less against the crossfires of old Ehlnofeys' wars. Again, the Argonian culture is based on these ideals of dependence and equality. You claim that, unlike the Nords, that the Argonian government does not depend on the actual people- but that is far from true.

&gt; You complained earlier of racial hatred being a bad part of Nord society but you hail it as an intrinsic part of Argonian culture.

The difference here is the difference between complete Isolationism and simple racism. It is the difference between USA and Atlantis. While the Nords let in foreigners and then mistreat them as they let them be assimilated. That is bad. The An-Xileel, instead, prefer to complete isolate their society to main a utopia. There is a clear difference here.

&gt; The Nords ideal homeland is Skyrim but yet they conquered and grew their territory

And immigrated from their own homes to the new territory only to rebel against themselves and establish different conflicting governments. Home is a place you protect and stay loyal to. Home is not a place you betray and fight. Skyrim is no home. Perhaps it was for the Snow Elves, but they were all killed off or left to rot beneath the surface by the arrogant Dwemer and your very own Nords.

So, to summarize my arguments. The Argonian population lives in a society based on ideals of complete and eternal equality. All depend on one another, and all who violate the rules of equality are branded traitors and 'assimilated' as they truly are. Nords may stay close to real life modern ideals of democracy, yet Argonians live yet better, in the way of the future, perfect and equal. The so-called isolationism they exhibit is nothing more than precautions taken to drive away lesser cultures from destroying the unity of Argonia.

And unlike other cultures, such as the Nords', the Argonian culture is eternal and invincible. The Nords are doomed to die by the weakly wrath of the Aldmeri Dominion- yet if any power to try and face Argonia's power in open battle, they would fall like the Dunmer and Dremora. It is true that the Nords may have once been more powerful than the Argonians, to the point they claimed ownership over Black Marsh for their Empire, but those times have long past.

The Empire, once able to conquer and spread like you have mentioned, is now half of it's original size and ruled by a rebel Emperor and his disloyal council. Skyrim is even worst, families and nations fighting among themselves.

Black Marsh, once disheartened and not united, is now the strongest force in Tamriel. A swarm of hiveminded people who had perfected the art of killing, and do so with the strongest weapons in Mundus.

So in a clash of Nords versus Argonians who would win? Why is that even a question?

Lilrhys:

Is reliance on another being a good basis for a culture though? Their reliance on the Hist isn't a fair an equal one since the Argonians are essentially the mortal arm of the Hist. There is no free will in Argonian Society only the will of the Hist. There is a facade of co-dependence but deep down there isn't any.

I do not think there is a difference between what you are saying. In Windhelm (which cannot be used as an example of wider Skyrim culture since it is a hugely complicated mess), there is segregation based on race on a city-scale. In Black Marsh there is segregation on a Provincial scale with essentially all non-Argonians being banned from Argonia.

A homeland need not be united. The so-called United Kingdom is and never has been united and even the United States suffered a Civil War. A homeland is where your people can trace their lineage back to and call 'home'. Skyrim was where the Nords were born and it is where they have called home for most of Tamrielic history. The Nords expanded their First Empire too big and too fast and suffered the consequences when their territories rebelled against them (not other Nords) and threw them out.

Skyrim is a broken land at the moment yes but it could still defeat an Argonian invasion. The Argonians have complete dominance in the Black Marsh but they're forces wouldn't last a day against any Army outside of Black Marsh.

To conclude, Skyrim is a proto-democratic (bordering on meritocratic) government in which the best people rule Skyrim whilst Argonia is a Hist-controlled land and the Hist do what the Hist want to do. Skyrim is better militarily because as I've said numerous times (and you have not denied) have defeated all the Races of Tamriel and could easily do so again.

I know the other races may look down on the quadruped forms of Khajiit but do the Khajiit themselves consider each subspieces equal? Or is any Khajiit offspring a happy thing to the parents and community? I suppose you have to take into account Khajiit traders, who have to deal with harser conditions than Khajiit who live in towns/farms. Would traveling Khajiit want, say a Senche, eating up limited food stores? 

If they don't want that Senche, are they able to time conception to get the subspieces they want to bear? Would that explain why most of the subspieces are not found outside of Elsweyr? Well, other than Bethesda just not putting them in the game.

In game, we see small ad-hoc units due to hardware limitations. In the lore, we very, very rarely get any kind of specifics. We know that the actual Legions of the Imperial Legion are roughly equivalent to Roman Legions (ie, roughly 5-6,000 men). Now, the structure of the Roman Legions was as such:

8 men - contubernium *(the Legions used 8-man tents, which made this a natural division)*

10 contubernia - 1 century *(80 men and ten tents per century, led by a centurion)*

6 centuriae - 1 cohort *(480 men)*

10 cohorts - 1 legion *(4,800 men, commanded by the legatus)*

In addition, the First Cohort was organised slightly differently, consisting of only five centuriae, but with each being double strength (16-man) units, for a total of 800 men. This left the actual Legion as roughly 5,200 men, not including officers. Atop this, each Legion had an attached 120-man cavalry unit, likely used as messengers and scouts rather than a battlefield force, bringing its total strength up to around 5,300 men before officers.

Each cohort was commanded by its ranking centurion, with the rank structure moving down from the Primus Pilus (first centurion, first cohort) to the sixth centurion, tenth cohort.



Now, this sort of fits with the Imperial Legion. The vast majority of its troops are foot rather than horse, and the vast majority of those are heavy infantry rather than light infantry or mages. In fact, there seem to be very few mages in the Legion, perhaps one in a hundred or less. With those numbers, it would make more sense to consolidate the Legion's mages into cadres of four or five in each cohort, likely attached to the first century. 

Magic in the Elder Scrolls universe isn't geared towards hurling fireballs around for mass destruction, and doing so in a military situation would be a waste. Far better to, say, mount up a half dozen conjurers and use them to summon atronachs. More power than heavy infantry and more mobile than light cavalry, making for a perfect charge breaker or flanker. Or use them to cover hillsides in ice to foul charges, or bolster formations with illusion magic.

So, my question to you, the learned scholars of teslore, is whether there are any actual official sources that shed any further light to either support or contradict these musings?

So thank you.

Before we get into it, I should let you know that I have absolutely no grasp on statistics at all, but I do like graphs. So that's the quality of information you can expect.

**[When did you get into TES?](http://i.imgur.com/WjSr2.png)**

Can't say I didn't expect this, though there are more newbies than I thought - which I didn't expect for a number of you that already comfortably know your way around lore. That's awesome.

Other than that, expected. A few hipsters were fans before Morrowind came out, and there are spikes every time a game is released.

Interestingly, though, people entered the fandom with older games even though newer and more popular ones were released more often than expected.

**[When did you get into lore?](http://i.imgur.com/BXiom.png)**

Again, mostly expected. Arena and Daggerfall didn't seem to offer much in the way of lore for most, and even though many entered the series with Daggerfall, didn't get into lore until later. There are spikes again with each release.

The most obvious of those spikes is in 2011, when a *ton* of people got into lore either from playing Skyrim or in anticipation of it's release. I'm a 2011er myself, it's good to know I'm not the only late bloomer around here.

A lot of people got into lore as soon as they got into TES, which is also pretty awesome.

**[What was your first TES game?](http://i.imgur.com/RLpJu.png)**

This one was quite interesting. Morrowind proved to be the game that has introduced players to TES most, even with all these newbies around. Or perhaps those people are too ashamed to admit the truth.

Many people commented on how Morrowind remains their favorite of the games, and I was interested that many people whose first game wasn't Morrowind mentioned that it quickly became their favorite.

**[Which TES games have you played?](http://i.imgur.com/q7Ui5.png)**

Sure enough, the latest three games are the most played by a long shot. A number have played Arena and Daggerfall (or at least, the first dungeons), which are likely ""trickle-down"" players from Skyrim, who also contributed a lot of plays in Oblivion and Morrowind's directions.

A handful of people have played the offshoot games, but not many at all - probably due to the limited availability of them. I think only one or two people said they've played Battlespire.

**[What game inspired you to get into lore?](http://i.imgur.com/8G3hY.png)**

Another interesting response. Morrowind definitely appears to be the most lore-inspiring game by a long shot (not that I didn't already know that). I didn't expect Skyrim to fall so short, given that it was the most played game. Many people didn't get into the lore until they went back and played the older TES games, and Morrowind was particularly persuasive when they did so.

A lot of people mentioned that browsing the internet got them into lore, just by reading about it. One person got into the lore before they'd played any of the games - now that is awesome.

**[For fun: What is your favorite race?](http://i.imgur.com/FQriZ.png)**

A lot of people mentioned more than one race, so these don't add up at all. Forgive me.

Unsurprisingly, the Dunmer dominated this question, taking over a quarter of the votes. Almost everyone that had played Morrowind voted for the Dunmer. What was surprising, however, was that a substantial amount of people who had not played Morrowind found them to be their favorite.

Bosmer were more popular than I anticipated, but I did expect the Khajiit popularity. Dwemer were also popular, as well as the Nords. Other than that, the rest of the races shared the votes rather evenly. The little sliver wedged between Orcs and Nords are the Chimer, who got a vote.

So there we go. Conclusions: The majority of scholars jumped on board in the last year or two, we don't have to shut up about how great Morrowind is because it is *statistically* fucking awesome, and the Dunmer are the kings of badass, regardless of game.

A lot of liberties were taken in my recording, and the questions were vague at times - particularly with lore. For example, I answered that I got into lore in 2011, but that's only when I *really* got into lore. I could've easily said 2005. Many people I'm sure differed in what they considered to be ""into lore"". It's uncountable, so it's really going to be different depending on the person.

What do you guys think of the results? If you're more... capable than I am in statistics, by all means, go to the first thread and make some observations.

It's [entrance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuNpVTM7_nI) is certainly unique, some unknown [bones](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/File:Kafrenzel_int_map_skyrim.jpg) larger than any animal seen in Skyrim are housed within it, and nobody in Skyrim seems to know anything peculiar about it, aside from that it exists.

Now, I'd like to go into deeper detail on the specific oddities of this location.


The entrance.  Possibly the strangest thing in all of Skyrim.  Simply none of it makes sense.  You enter what appears to be a simple Dwemer ruin, and view a fairly large and open room.  Taking a few steps inside, a light appears on a pedestal, illuminating several assorted pots and vases, as well as two dead bodies.  Upon interacting with this light, you are trapped, and the light seems to begin scanning you, with some form of digital sound.  It is simply using signals, and they do have a physical quantity, but it is unknown what they may mean at this time.

Regardless, once it is done scanning you, it follows this with causing the longest fall in the game.  The bandit bodies fall with you.

This part made me question something.  If the bandit bodies fell only when you entered, then something most have killed them previously.  Nothing is in this room other than that sphere.  There they are though, dead on the floor near that sphere.  So what was it that killed them?  Does the sphere possess the ability to kill?  What is the sphere for that matter, and what exactly was it...screeching?

Now we are brought to yet another oddity, the longest fall in the game, revealing a massive cavern that is...entirely useless.

No special quests take place in this cavern whatsoever, no information can be found on it in game, nobody seems to know anything about it whatsoever.  Occasionally a fetch quest will send you here, but that's it, and even then they send you through Stony Creek Cave, seemingly not aware of the alternative entrance.

And now back to the bones.  Some have suggested mammoth bones in the past, but that would mean a mammoth that is probably around 3 stories tall.  Rather, whale bones seem much more likely for the size.  But this is inside a mountain.  What are these bones doing there?  And why did the Dwemer think they were so important?



To summarize the massive number of questions about this place:

What is that sphere?

What was it screeching?

Why did it drop you, but not the bandits earlier?

Who or what killed those bandits, and what criteria made it so you were not killed by the same thing?

What are those bones?

Why did the Dwemer put such an advance security system in place, and neglect to put any actual spheres, spiders, or centurions inside it?

Why did the Dwemer care about this hollow mountain with some bones in it anyway?

Why is this entire massive cave not referenced or explained whatsoever in the game, as if it doesn't even exist?

Why exactly is this random mountain entirely hollow anyways?



There are a number of further questions that could be generated about this place, but for now I think this is more than enough.  If anyone can find any information at all on this, I would appreciate it, but I am at a loss here.  I've ran through everything from 'Crazy Dwemer' to 'KINMUNE' but nothing quite fits together here.

If you were going to hide food from Alduin, you'd put it under the table not right on his plate. It makes the whole thing redundant, why would Alduin have a problem with these peices of creation if they were right there on Nirn? He'd have already eaten them. If these pieces of creation were anywhere, they'd probably be in the Void.

Furthermore, how would a piece of creation Alduin didn't know about be in the Imperial City?

1363307636.0,35,self.teslore,1abjki,"The Disease, or Curse, of Dagoth Ur's Ash Creatures.",froggyjoe,35,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1abjki/the_disease_or_curse_of_dagoth_urs_ash_creatures/,"Hey scholars, I seek opinions and analysis, as well as offering some speculation of my own. I recently started digging back into Morrowind, and this time around I really paid attention to the effects Dagoth-Ur's magic has on his minions. **This is long, I apologize to you all**:  
  
To me there seems to be a disease-like progression in Dagoth Ur's servants. The ash variety atleast. There's the [Ash Slaves](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Slave), who by all appearances look like they were once captured Dunmer (hence the collar), and through Dagoth Ur's curse have lost there eyes, and are in the process of losing some of the skin around the sockets.  
  
Noticing this and then going back to [Ash Zombies](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Zombie), I feel like my original assumption that the Zombie's faces were ritualistically carved out was false, and instead its just a later stage of the curse that's been put on the Ash Slaves. Note that the collar has been removed. This is interesting to me because the frontal lobe, which is popularly associated with decision making processes and memory, looks to have been degraded sometime in this transformation. The curse by itself might not be what puts the Dunmer under Dagoth Ur's sway, but rather the degradation of this essential brain matter. Hence the necessity of the collar in early stages, since the inflicted presumably have moments of free will and lucidity.  
  
I wanted to take this further and link the onset of this brain degradation to the obsessive compulsive dialogue of the Ash Slaves (""Everything is wrong. This is not straight. This is too high. This is in my way. We must put them right.""), but I'm not savvy enough on the subject of neurobiology to do this (if you are, please comment!)  
  
So Ur's control on the subject might be somehow related to the degeneration of this area of the brain. Or rather, maybe this part of the brain is replaced by something more Dagoth Ur-y! Hence when the curse progresses to [Ash Ghoul](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Ghoul) stages there's a very conspicuous tendril growing out of the poor bastard's head... Which then seems to grow until the subject resembles everyone's favorite [Ascended Sleepers](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ascended_Sleeper).  
  
I love the parasitic hive mind thing going on here, and it feels like it fits my understanding of Ur's intentions perfectly. I'm under the assumption that Dagoth Ur is trying to make everything a part of himself. (Through a post I thought I read somewhere on this subreddit:) that he's trapped in the Dreamsleeve, is aware of the godhead, and is trying to consume the godhead (ie, existence) so that he can be the godhead.  
  
**So my questions:**  
  
How does this relate to the blight and corpus? This transformation doesn't seem to be part of the divine disease, since corpus appears to cause lesions and bloating that isn't present here. Why are some Dunmer force-fed corpus meat, while others appear to be controlled by this curse? Or is this somehow a late progression of corpus?   
  
Why are [Ash Vampires](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures#Ash_Vampire) not subjected to this transformation, or corpus for that matter? I'd already assume not corpus, since by all observations it saps the inflicted's intelligence, and Ash Vampires are the nobility and leaders of the Sixth House. ""Tendrilification"", for whatever it actually does, seems to maintain the intelligence of the inflicted in its late stages though. Hence Ascended Sleepers being ""smart"" (source, the uesp page).

It is my understanding that in TES, despite the race of an offspring being determined by the race of the mother, the offspring inherits some characteristics of both parents. We see this with in-game characters, such as the Grey Prince from Oblivion, and in books.

It is also my understanding that Bretons are the product of Altmer and a long line of men. If I am correct, then, in everything I've already said, Bretons should look like men but be good at magic and possibly taller (from the elf side). We know magic contributes to lifespan, so they also ought to live longer than Nords or other men. However, Bretons are both shorter and don't live as long as Nords or Imperials. This seems really counterintuitive to me. I just wondered if there was some lore-based reason for it, because I would prefer one of those over ""it was an oversight"".

Thanks! Sorry again if this has already been posted. I just had a lovely conversation with some TESblrite about it, which is why it's back on the forefront of my mind. He mentioned that it might be some sort of product of breeding/a recessive thing, but I don't know. Just want all your lovely thoughts. Have a good day :)


EDIT: I'm unable to find my previous source for bretons living up to 90 years, but I swear, I've read about how short their lives are. This is so infuriating! The only thing I can find that mentions it is a roleplay site, but I know that's not where I read it. I'm also finding people assuring each other with things like ""bretons elven ancestry actually resulted in them being sickly when they hit middle age"" and ""Bretons have the opposite effect from what you'd expect, and usually burn bright but quickly, ~50-60 years"" but those aren't on lore forums.

[On Nedes and Nords](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/194uhp/on_nedes_and_nords/) by /u/lebiro is a great explanation of a commonly-held misconception, [Altmeris Language construction](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/193m32/altmeris_language_construction/) by /u/myrrlyn (and others that I should mention) is a really cool ConLang job which we need more of. Then of course we have /u/Prince-of-Plots's explanation of MK's relationship with Bethesda which we'll all be glad to have whenever we have the 'MK is Fanon' argument thrown at us. Honourable mentions go to /u/Anhrl for [An Essay on the Mammoths of Skyrim](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18y858/an_essay_on_the_mammoths_of_skyrim/) and his/her [Inquiry into the properties of glass](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1939fw/an_inquiry_into_the_properties_of_glass/) as well as to everybody else who's submitted content to this sub.

Truth be told I haven't been visiting /r/teslore half as much as I use to and even then it's only for moderating (I completely blame this on the Witcher 2 for being a far better game than Skyrim in so many ways although obviously not in the Lore).

Despite this fact I have noticed one new face among the throng of you elders is, our Scholar of the Week, **/u/Anhrl**. Honourable mention goes to /u/ppitm who may be new to /r/teslore but is definitely an old hand at the Lore.

In Morrowind we encounter Tahriel, attempting to perfect his scrolls of Icarian Flight. But short of this sort of magic we see very little attempt by the other races of Nirn (as far as I know) to attempt to expedite trade, travel, and warfare by the skies. Now yes I know we have a Dragonborn that can fly dragons in the new DLC, which i dont have yet on PC...... but this leads to my next point, Dwemer Airships. We all know the Dwemer's disappearance led to all of their works being left behind for the other races to explore and learn from. What we dont see is a ready adoption of their Airship designs, except for the crashed Airship we can briefly explore in Bloodmoon. This sort of segues into a larger discussion, maybe another thread on another day, about the lack of implementing Dwemer technology into modern Tamrielic society.

My question to you, humble scholars, is why dont we see a greater interest in this form of travel? Is it considered too dangerous to try and master the notoriously difficult Dwemer designs? That would certainly explain the disaster that befell the ship in Morrowind. Is there a religious component? The Dwemer are considered the most secular race in Tamriel, and it is probably not a stretch to label them as Tamriel's first Atheists. Would worshippers of the 8/9 Divines, find powered flight offensive as a societal majority to their beliefs? 

I am inclined to believe that it is a combination of both of these scenarios. It is easy to see people in modern Tamriel being intimidated and frightened by the godless Dwemer and their ""magic"" flight machines. As for the religious side of things, we discussed in forums past of Magicka being the reason why technology has not advanced much in the present Kalpa. Could the majority of Tamriel's citizens find it an affront to their Gods to try and enhance their lives and livelihoods through the Dwemer machinations? Or is it so simple as the time and effort, not to mention the danger and difficulty of reaching the more advanced Dwemer ruins that has left their technology estranged from the rest of the races?

This is the first ever *Weekly Community Thread*! This is a new project I'm starting, hoping to give a little space every week for community discussion not involving actual lore, and give a little credit to good scholars and discussions.

I will be posting these every week on Friday, every week with a new ""Scholar of the Week"" and ""Threads/ discussions of the week.""

The main goal of these threads will be providing space for a weekly community discussion. I also want to use these threads as a sort of ""feedback section"" where you guys can tell us mods what you want to add or change in the subreddit. The final goal of the Weekly Thread is to give credit to the fine scholars of our community.


So, without further due, let's go right in to the to-be-normal thread structure:

**Weekly Summary**

We have had quite the nice week- with about two pages-load of threads. We have gained an awesome *169* subscribers this week, and saw some good discussions and threads such as [End of an Empire by theguywholosesthings](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/zn5sf/end_of_an_empire/), [Is there a list of individuals/beings who have achieved CHIM? and it's discussion about Ma'iq and breaking the 4th wall](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/zm7c6/is_there_a_list_of_individualsbeings_who_have/), and of course the [Jel Language thread (I understand this was actually posted 8 days ago, but it was too good a thread in my opinion to not mention)](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/zfxy9/jel_language/)

I've been arguing among myself whether to remove [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/zs6mv/diseases_and_other_illnesses/c67b8fj) chain of comments, seeing as it is not subreddit-appropriate. I've had a good laugh out of it so I let it stay, but I'd like you tell me in the comments what you think we should do about Novelty Accounts and the such.

Basically, we've had a really good week. Thank you guys for posting and commenting. Now let's move on to our

**Scholar of the Week**

I've had two options for Scholar of the Week, both very good veteran scholars, so it's been a hard decision. Since our runner-up has some reputation for being a fine scholar, and will surely win some later weeks, I've decided to give the Scholar of the Week award to a different user who's been posting some good comments lately to balance things out.

So congratulations, [Wuuthrad](http://www.reddit.com/user/wuuthrad), you win this week's Scholar of the Week. Go to the local tavern and celebrate with a horn of Nord Mead and a fine-looking tavern-wench. You've made some good comments this week, especially in the last few days. 

-  -  -  -

So that is it for the Weekly Thread. Please go ahead and tell me what you'd like me to add to the thread. Again, please also use the comments section to suggest or complain about anything subreddit-related- as well as talk with other members of the community about anything. A large part of the thread is intended to provide space for the joking around and TES:O hating I know y'all need to do. So go ahead and tell me about anything, heck, even make some community fan art. I believe PoP has already received a cool little drawing of him as Boethiah, why shouldn't I get a drawing? Kudos to anyone who can make a drawing of ""Xenoposeidon, the Argonian scholar-assassin :P""

Finally, before I end the thread, just one final question:

1343668135.0,32,self.teslore,xedvh,Is Vivec the biggest traitor/rat of them all?,OccupyTamriel,38,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/xedvh/is_vivec_the_biggest_traitorrat_of_them_all/,"Please excuse my bad english.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, it has been awhile since I played Morrowind and have been studying the Lore excessively. 
But from all I've read, Vivec seems to be the biggest a**hole in all of Tamriel.

First, he's one of the major reasons for the war-breakout (okay, this is extremely simplified), then, after the war, he ignores the warnings and threats of Azura/Nerevar not to use the tools of Kagrenac and achieved Godhood and, together with Sothe Sil and Almalexia, most likely killed the Nerevar (is this already officially confirmed)?

He then creates the Ministry of Truth which was floating over Vivec thanks to his power? So this means that he ensured that once, he would lose his godhood again, that all people in Morrowind would die?

And is it true that Dagoth Ur (Sorry, I forgot his birth-name) was the one who originally wanted to destroy the tools after the war? What were Nerevar's intentions not to agree with Dagoth Ur?

The Morrowind MQ must be one of the most complex stories in the history of videogames. 
After my first playthrough I thought that Vivec was ""The Good"" and Dagoth Ur ""The Bad"", the second time I thought that there is no good and no evil, but no I'm almost positive that Dagoth Ur is the good one and I feel terribly sorry for killing him.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on this topic, I really hope this subreddit will stay alive forever.

Anyway, we decided to use the insignias of the factions found in the lore such as the Buoyant Armigers, Psijic Order, Mages Guild, etc. for flair.

New flair will of course be added at some point, and you can post your suggestions for different icons and/or factions which may or may not be added sometime in the vaguely near future.

Another important change made was the removal of the Penitus Oculatus. The original purpose of the PO was to help struggling newcomers get acclimated and familiar with TES lore and to reward quality contributors. Since the introduction of the PO, however, we have seen a dramatic rise in the quality of discussions and posts here. As such, there are simply too many great community members who would make excellent PO members that we decided it would be best to disband the group rather than making it redundant. 

Thank you for making this place so great and enjoy the new flair!

It's akin to comparing the Ka Po' Tun to the Khajiit only with the association of, ""They're both cats.""

There is, too, the detail that the Argonians never seemed to have any trouble with the Tsaesci as the Dunmer and the Nords did, despite Black Marsh's proximity to Akavir. But that's another easy pot-shot, dragged in along with the reptilian association.

But! There is actual evidence of an association. For one, there is the Striking, an association many of you are likely already aware of. From [Sermon 21 of the 36 Lessons of Vivec](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:36_Lessons_of_Vivec,_Sermon_21):

""The Spokes are the eight components of chaos, as yet solidified by the law of time: static change, if you will, something the lizard gods refer to as the Striking. That is the reptile wheel, coiled potential, ever-preamble to the never-action.""

This Striking, clearly associated with the Argonians, is also mentioned several times in the [Tsaesci Creation Myth](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/tsaesci-creation-myth-and-we-ate-it-become-it):

""There was the Striking, and the Egg was split into twelve worlds, one for each serpent who had a name, and the names of the serpents were alive and coiled into themselves and became more eggs, for names are self-maters, and the Naming went and went.""

Later repeated here:

""The name-eggs that had survived without also turning into calculation powder settled and became dreugh-waters, which was the first thing to finally encompass the risks attempted by the Striking.""

It seems that the Argonians and the Tsaesci share this concept of 'the Striking'.

In addition, there is this (admittedly not only unattributed but in-character) quotation, [supposedly from a dev](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/forum-archives-others):

""The Worshippers of the Unnamed Lord, know as 'Argonians' on Nirni, are the Descendents of Boethiah and the Serpent-men.""

The Serpent-men clearly being the Tsaesci, as they are most often referred to in those terms, and the Tsaesci have always had a strong association with Boethiah (in their Eating culture and in their Serpent attributes).

1365638174.0,36,self.teslore,1c3lyl,Do know for sure that the thalmor want to undo creation?,mr_penguin,40,4,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1c3lyl/do_know_for_sure_that_the_thalmor_want_to_undo/,"Other than Ancano's dialogue during the winterhold questline (""I have the power to unmake the world at my fingertips""), I haven't been able to find any other sources that state the Thalmor's goal is to undo creation. It's my person belief that Ancano just pretty much went insane from the power he could get from the Eye of Magnus.

We know the Thalmor are supremacists and want to restore mer dominace but other than that I just can't find any concrete evidence that they actually want to undo creation. I mean, we know the Altmer believe that they were once gods and want to return to that state but that's more or less been part of their culture and religion and so far (except the Thalmor) no Altmer group has really tried to act on that belief. The Altmer seem to be pretty fond of Auri-El too, and if I remember correctly it's said that Auri-El ""Ascended in full observance of his followers so that they might know how to."" So Auri-El taught them by way of example how to ascend, I'm pretty sure that doesn't involve uncreation.

We don't know a whole lot about the Thalmor leaders other than they are secretive and likely manipulative. We do know that the Thalmor government is made up of both Altmer and high ranking Bosmer. I have a hard time believing the Bosmer that make up some of the high ranking Thalmor would go along with a plan to undo creation.

So, before I ramble on some more, are there any texts that support the theory that the Thalmor actually want to undo creation? Or until those text surfaces can we assume that the Thalmor are actually just radicals who take mer dominace to an extreme?

My take on them is that they are radicals who are essentially tired of Man neglecting the various Mer (The Empire wasn't exactly known for giving much love to either Valenwood or Summerset, and especially just neglected Valenwood all together. I think the Khajiit fall in with that too). They sincerely believe that Altmer culture and beliefs are the only correct ones and want to (rightfully in their eyes) restore that culture to dominance albeit using extreme methods. They took advantage of a bad situation to rise to power and are garnering support by spreading propaganda that they are just standing up for their elven bretheren (Ondomo even calls the Bosmer their 'cousins' in during that quest in Markarth implying that they at least somewhat care about the Bosmer or he was just lying). 


What's everyone's take on this? I personally just have a hard time believing that the Thalmor are 100% evil and want to undo creation (unless I'm missing some texts that state this is their goal). I think they are insane and their methods are pretty horrible, but they seem to have been driven insane by getting stomped on by Men and having their Culture and religion butchered into what the Empire uses today, and we know there are at least some (though not all) Bosmer that agree with them and the Bosmer have historically been rather ""neutral"" and peaceful.

I know there are old accounts of the Tiger-People and Golden Scaled Vampire Snakes, but to me they all seem like typical Pocket Guide book-sale exaggerations. Especially when taken into account that the only realistic sounding document of Akavir, the Disaster at Ionith,  doesn't seem to care to describe them (the Tsaesci atleast) at all.

**EDIT**: Thanks to everyone for helping me with my research. Clearly the information regarding the Tang Mo, Ka' Po Tun, and the Kamal is so lacking its impossible to truly discuss them, so i'll focus on the Tsaesci. This is the hypothesis I'm currently working with;

The inclusion of the Human-Tsaesci ghosts and skeletons in Oblivion could easily be chopped up to game development . Unfortunately, game development limitations usually has to be converted ~~or dragon broke~~ into lore eventually. I personally am not so much a fan of the ""because eaten=assimilation therefore there may be humans among the ranks of the Akaviri-Tsaesci Invading Army"" idea. It may well be true that eaten=assimilation, but because no documents state anything along the lines of ""The Human Tsaesci Soldiers vs. The Snakemen Tsaesci"" I don't think the theory can stand on its own.

I think the main source of the Akaviri Conundrum is how unreliable and lacking in information the source books are. We have [Mysterious Akavir](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/mysterious-akavir), as the primary basis of most knowledge of the continent, even though it was anonymously published at some unknowable point in the past. I would posit it may be an extremely old,  Elvish text (referencing Lorkhan as opposed to Shezzar or Shor) that was poorly translated and abused as it travelled through the eras, considering the many strange and awkward phrasings contained within it. Tosh Raka ""has very many new ideas"", oh really, does he now? How incredibly nonsensical.

Next we have a much more reliable book, [the Disaster as Ionith](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/disaster-ionith), which barely describes the Tsaesci at all. In fact, due to the thoroughness that the Lord Pottreid tried to go into for the sake of the report, it seems almost odd how little information was given regarding the descriptions of the Tsaesci forces. Perhaps this is from the lack of information the survivors had, or the Battlemages reported, but to me it would suggest that the Tsaesci's physicality was not remarkable enough to make a point of. He does mention the Tsaesci scouts as riding mounts, which could imply they have legs and not snake bodies, but, its a stretch to say thats confirmed in any way.

Besides these two documents, and the 2920 series, which as you well know is not a history, but a ~~fiction~~ *dramatization* of historical events, we also have passing mentions of their attacks on Tamriel, that again only goes so far as to say ""They were mean snake-men"", and not attempting to describe them in anymore more detail.

So, the answer to do we have physical *depictions* of the Tsaesci?
&gt;Yes, but no it might just be gamedev laziness.

Do we have physical *descriptions*?
&gt;Yes, but its so ambiguous or unreliable as to leave it a complete mystery

1355549038.0,33,self.teslore,14vsha,Miraak and the Greedy Man,TheGhostOfDRMURDER,38,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14vsha/miraak_and_the_greedy_man/,"I'm sorry if this is discussed in the DLC itself, I'm a PS3 player and, as such, have only what is recorded on UESP to go on, but it seems to me that Mirraak shares many similarities to the Greedy Man of Skaal myth, enough that it seems quite possible to me that the two entities are one and the same, or at least myth-echoes of one another.

**Their Past**

What first comes to mind is Miraak's former position of importance as a dragon priest. Likely, he was a missionary from Skyrim or Atmora who lead or worked with the Skaals. A desire for power eventually turns him against the dragons who, at this time in history, would have been viewed by Nords as sacred spirits, the incarnation of their early-Aka entity that would likely evolve into the Skaal's All-Maker.

When we compare this brief summary of Miraak's past to the Greedy Man's we see a few similarities. The Greedy Man was also once a member of the Skaal until he turned against ""the All-Maker,"" again likely a corruption of Miraak turning against the dragons.

**Their Plans and Enemies**

Mirraak's return in Skyrim is marked by the corruption of the All-Maker stones, holy standing stones that grant powers to the Skaal and to the Dragon Born. This corruption, and I may be mistaken here, is to funnel the powers of the stones to him in Apocrypha so he may return fully to our plane. His plan is ruined by the arrival the Dragonborn, a person tied to neither the path of the Warrior, Wizard or Thief. The Dragonbron cleanses the stones and sets to defeat Miraak. What is also important is that Mirraak steals the souls of dragons to fuel his Thu'um, the Gift of Kyne.

The Greedy Man, apparently out of spite for the Skaal though I do not doubt that the true reasons were lost to myth, corrupts the All-Maker stones, robbing them of their power. This plan is ruined by the arrival of Aevar Stone-Singer, a character tied neither to the path of the Warrior, Shaman or Elder. Aevar cleanses the stones and goes to face the Greedy Man. The Greedy Man keeps to himself a ""bag of winds."" 

When one contemplates the connection to the Nordic Thu'um as the breath of Kyne, flatly being referred to as ""bringing a wind with [you]"" by Oblivion's description of the Nords, the parallels between the hording of winds and souls becomes obvious. Furthering this is Aevar's statement ""I will return the Winds to my people, that we may feel the spirit of the All-Maker in our souls again."" If the All-Maker is viewed as an evolution of the proto-Nordic dragon-god, then comparison of the ""Winds"" to the ""Dragon-Souls"" becomes even greater.

**Their Curse and Names**

Miraak is never referred to as the Greedy Man in game, at least to my knowledge, and this might raise a few alarms. Why wouldn't the Skaal recognize their satanic myth-figure? It's simple and stated in the story of Aevar: The Greedy Man's name is stricken from the tales of the Skaal for fear it would bring ruin upon them. The Greedy Man seems a fit enough moniker for Miraak, then. He greedily eats the souls of dragons. He greedily steals the power of the All-Maker stones. He greedily seeks to control the Skaal.

We then have their eventual fates to contemplate. At the end of Aevar's quest, The Greedy Man is banished from the island of Solstheim by the freeing of the Winds, the ""spirit of the All-Maker."" While Miraak supposedly fled to Apocrypha after a Skaal uprising (I may have this part wrong. If so, please correct me.), which seem rather substantially different. We then also know that, according the the Seven Fights of the Aldudagga, that the Greedy Man is trapped ""half-outside"" of Kalpas, due to his attempts to hide ""under his mountain.""

I think this is another sort of historical half-remembrance. I believe Aevar lead, or was, the assault against Miraak that results in him fleeing from Nirn. The circumstances of his fleeing are due to him being killed, and the lost dragon souls being freed. His spirit then finds its way to Apocrypha, where it bargains with Hermaeus-Moria. He is somehow able to half-enter our realm, evidenced by his stealing of dragon souls, mirroring The Greedy Man's being ""half-outside"" of the Kalpa.

**Conclusion**

Now, obviously, The Greedy Man shares much of Lorkhan's ""bad aspect:"" an evil trickster who tries to steal power, enemy of the dragon-god, heart/being trapped under a mountain, scion of the Advesary/Padomay etc. Which for good reason draws the idea that he is simply the Skaal's idea of Lorkhan, so I propose the following explainations, assuming that my previous comparisons hold true.

1) Miraak and the Greedy Man are Shezzarines. They may or may not be the same person, it is unknowable. Common behaviors would emerge between the two as they are both embodiments of the same concept.

2) Miraak is the Greedy Man. As a Dragonborn, he is linked with Lorkhan as much as with Aka, and to the Skaal embodied what was wrong with both of them. This translates to the more general Adversary/All-Maker dichotomy of the Skaal: they combine Lorkhan and Akatosh's good aspects while lumping their negative together with Miraak.

3) The Greedy Man is Lorkhan, Miraak is mantling him. Miraak is merely familiar with the actions of the Greedy Man and is attempting to escape Apocrypha by mirroring them, mantling the Greedy Man and escaping to another sub-gradient.

If this has been discussed before, or is brought up in the game, I am very sorry. I thought it was an interesting idea that I hadn't seen before.

So, what does TESLore think of my theory?

Obligatory TL;DR: Miraak shares many similarities to the Greedy Man. Are they the same person? Mantling the same person? Is one mantling the other? What do you think? 

**Edit Regarding Information Provided to Me by Regalnerd**

Thanks to regalnerd for correcting me on a few things I got wrong! See below for a summary and how I feel this works into my theory.

Miraak is referred to as ""the Traitor"" by the Skaal, and was defeated by someone called, ""the Guardian,"" apparently the progenitor of the Skaal people. This shares obvious similarities to the story of Aevar Stone-Singer, too, more so than what I previously thought.

To summarize both stories:

Miraak is a typical dragon-priest of the early Nords on Solsthiem. After a time, he is corrupted by greed and lust for power and begins devouring the souls of dragons, who would have been sacred to the early Nords. His fall is brought about by Herma-Mora and no doubt in line with him discovering he is dragonborn, a blessing granted by Aka/Shor. He is an evil terror for a time and is defeated by someone called ""The Guardian,"" a powerful Shaman, eventually a wise Elder and ever-vigilant Warrior, and being banished from our plane. Miraak's name is avoided by the Skaal afterwards and he is called the Traitor. The Guardian then apparently founds the Skaal.

The Greedy Man is a typical member of the Skaals, his early life mostly unknown. After a time he is corrupted by the power of the Adversary, a being who shares many of the negative traits of Aka and Lorkhan. He is an evil terror for a time, before being defeated by Aevar Stone-Singer, a person who is neither a Warrior, Priest or Elder, and being banished from Solstheim. At the end of a Kalpa, he becomes trapped both in/out of the Kalpas.

Now, the main changes here is that the Skaal were apparently still aware of Miraak's place in their history and had their own names for him, which I did not know. Oops on my part.

I find it likely that the authors of the story of Aevar Stone-Singer, and the authors of The Traitor, are merely picking up on different parts of the same story. I don't feel this substantially changes my previous theories, and in support of my theory that Miraak is (at least the version of) the Greedy Man we see in the myth I propose the following as a ""true"" time-line, uncorrupted by seasons of story-telling.

Miraak is a dragon-priest to the early Nord settlers on Solsthiem. After a time, the blessing of the dragonborn descends on him, coming from the malevolent forces found in Alduin in Lorkhan. Miraak begins consuming dragons, and seeks power for powers sake, tricking beings into his service, etc. He corrupts the dragon-stones, seeking their power, barters with Herma-mora, and generally makes an ass of himself. Aevar Stone-Singer works to undo his power, succeeds and defeats him in combat, killing him and banishing his soul to Apocrypha. Aevar goes on to turn the early Nords on Solsthiem into the Skaal. Various stories about Aevar create stories which the people tell each-other in verbal tradition, eventually being corrupted into the Aevar Stone-Singer story, and the Traitor and the Guardian story. Miraak, being a particularly powerful spirit, is able to partially return to Nirn after a time.

There are, as I said before, the possibilities that Miraak is intentionally mimicking the Greedy Man, and the possibility that they are both different Shezzarines (of the worst kind) who are similar to each-other.

Not so much the concept of them, but what they are generally considered to be.

There isn't too much on UESP, but a couple things did stand out to me.
&gt;In the context of Aevar Stone-Singer the All-Maker and the Adversary bear a resemblance to Anu and Padomay who are in a similar antithetical conflict.

&gt;Aevar Stone-Singer, The Seven Fights of the Aldudagga and the Altmeri Heart of the World share the image of a trickster, Lorkhan, who took away the strength of the people.

There's also some old posts that directly say the All-Maker is Akatosh and the Greedy Man is Lorkhan. But I don't think this makes sense at all. It's mostly because of one line from The Story of Aevar Stone-Singer.

&gt;The Adversary has many aspects. He appears in the unholy beasts and the incurable plague. At the End of Seasons, we will know him as Thartaag the World-Devourer. But in these ages he came to be known as the Greedy Man.

Everyone says that Akatosh is the All-Maker, but I think that's backwards. ""The Adversary has many aspects."" Akatosh, or perhaps Aka would be more proper for this, is known for having many aspects (Alduin, Akatosh, Auri-El, possibly even Mehrunes Dagon and Azura). But the main thing that gets me is this: ""At the End of Seasons, we will know him as Thartaag the World-Devourer."" One of the Adversary's aspects is Thartaag the World-Devourer, of which there is only one parallel. Alduin the World-Eater.

In addition, it makes perfect sense to call Lorkhan the All-Maker. For one things, Nords are already known to worship Lorkhan. For another, Lorkhan is the one who originally had the idea to create Mundus and is directly responsible for the creation of the mortal plane.

I submit that, contrary to everything I can find, Lorkhan is the All-Maker of Skaal worship and Aka(tosh) is the Adversary or Greedy Man. It's the only one that seems to make sense with what I've seen.

Questions, comments, criticisms, and information I did not previously have that completely kills this theory are all welcome.

The contents of the Word Walls hardly possess any logical connection to the deceased interred next to them. 

Take the Walls for the shout for Storm Call, for example. All three locations are resting places for named, masked Dragon Priests (Raghot at Forelhost, Vokun at High Gate Ruins, Nahkriin at Skuldafn, respectively), but the translations for their Word Walls are as follows (courtesy of UESP):

&gt;of doomed Vundeheim, burned

An even more outrageous example is the Word Wall for Kyne's Peace in Ragnvald, home of Otar the Mad who probably doesn't fit the following description:

&gt;Here lies (the) body of Hela,
&gt;friend to all beasts,
&gt;servant of Kyne. May she find
&gt;rest in the Forest of Dreams.

A feasible explanation would be that Heimverlund and Hrothmar are the dragon priests' names before they took up the masks, but what of Nahkriin and Otar's Word Wall? Who erected it? How were they able to learn the Dragon Language? When was it erected? What was the connection of Vundeheim to Nahkriin, and between Otar and Hela?

Perhaps it's time that someone with better artistic talent than myself produce another one. 

My line of inquiry is rather about the islands between Tamriel and Akavir. Akavir itself is only pictured in broad strokes: Tsaesci is in the southwest and shares a border with Ka'Po'Tun, Tang Mo includes many islands and shares a border with Kamal and Tsaesci, and Kamal is likely in the north. That's a decent outline. 

However, we do know a bit about the islands in between. With [Disaster at Ionith](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/report-disaster-ionith) as a guide, we can infer that the expeditionary force conquered the islands before reaching Esroniet, which was the closest to Akavir. Also, the expeditionary force was a very large fleet. I think that's somewhat important for later questions. From the [brief history](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/brief-history-empire-v3) of the Empire, we can also ascertain that the order of the conquest was Roscrea, Ynslea, Cathnoquey, and Esroniet. In the [PGv3](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/pocket-guide-empire-third-edition-throat-world-skyrim) in the Skyrim section, it claims that the Solitude-Dawnstar alliance annexed the fief of Roscrea and was exploring deeper into the sea of ghosts. 

My theory is that rather than run under Tamriel from west to north-east, this Padomaic island chain runs from north to south-west. Why would Solitude annex a fief on the other side of the continent and only then push further out to sea?

This theory, inconsequential though it might be, leads me to question mostly where the expeditionary force would have launched from. If the map earlier is the presumption, that assumes that the fleet traveled from southern Cyrodiil or Elsweyr or something. Given the size of the fleet, I wonder if they would not instead departed from the major northern ports, Dawnstar or Solitude. 

Anyway, this all seems like a silly point, but I've been thinking lately on Akavir and what things could look like over there.  Also still waiting on a nice full Nirn map. That'd be awesome.

I've been reading up on some of the more esoteric aspects of TES lore, and I'm getting stuck on how some of the concepts relate to each other. I think I understand that kalpas are an unending cycle of birth, existence, death, and rebirth of Mundus, with one big change occurring in each cycle that makes it different from each previous kalpa. Many seem to theorize that in the current kalpa, the emergence, victory, and ascension of Tiber Septim is the big difference, and that his role as a stabilizing influence has allowed the current world to exist much longer than in previous cycles. This would mean that the history of the current kalpa is very different from earlier ones and that the events of the games are playing out for the first time ever. Therefore, prior cycles have never had a Septim dynasty, an Oblivion Crisis, or a Second Aldmeri Dominion.

Now for the Towers. These structures and their associated Stones stabilize Mundus and keep it from collapsing back into a formless state of Aurbis. The Thalmor are working to sabotage these Towers in an effort to escape the mortal coil and return to a higher state of existence in union with their gods.

So what happens if they succeed? Does the destruction of the Towers simply end the current kalpa and initiate a new one? Or would this be a premature return to the state of chaos/stasis, disrupting the flow of the kalpas? Is each kalpa destined to play out a certain way, and whatever is meant to be just happens regardless or mortal efforts or intentions? The Thalmor obviously know about the Towers, but do they (or any mortal) know about kalpas?

And one final question on a slightly different note. We know that:

*There is one major difference in the timeline of each kalpa

*These changes accrue from cycle to cycle

*The Aedra seem to intervene to help maintain Mundus

*(not sure about this one) The gods remember what happened in each previous cycle

Would it not be reasonable to assume that the one big change each cycle is caused by a divine intervention to extend the longevity of the kalpa? The ultimate result of this would be that the gods, with the knowledge gained from previous kalpas, and with the desire to keep each kalpa going for as long as possible, will only grow more and more successful at extending the cycles so that each one runs longer than the last.

Hopefully that didn't all just turn into gibberish at the end. I know that final bit relies on a fair number of assumptions, and truthfully I don't know how many are actually backed up by lore. Again, please correct me on any errors of knowledge or reasoning.

From the shore it is hard to tell what is city and what is Palace, for it all rises from the islands of the lake towards the sky in a stretch of gold. Whole neighborhoods rest on the jeweled bridges that connect the islands together. Gondolas and river-ships sail along the watery avenues of its flooded lower dwellings. Moth-priests walk by in a cloud of ancestors; House Guards hold exceptionally long daikatanas crossed at intersections, adorned with ribbons and dragon-flags; and the newly arrived Western legionnaires sweat in the humid air. The river mouth is tainted red from the tinmi soil of the shore, and river dragons rust their hides in its waters. Across the lake the Imperial City continues, merging into the villages of the southern red river and ruins left from the Interregnum.

&gt;The Emperor's Palace is a crown of sun rays, surrounded by his magical gardens. One garden path is known as Green Emperor Road-here, topiaries of the heads of past Emperors have been shaped by sorcery and can speak. When one must advise Tiber Septim, birds are drawn to the hedgery head, using their songs as its voice and moving its branches for the needed expressions.""

- A Pocket Guide to The Empire and its environs, First Edition

Sure, some of it may be hyperbole courtesy of the author, but none of that warrants the IC being depicted as a big, boring, concrete wheel.

And yet, this isn't even one of the most out-there descriptions of TES cities, seeing as Alinor is described as:

&gt;Human traders were only allowed at its ports, and they described the city as ""made from glass or insect wings."" Less fantastic accounts come from the Imperial emissaries of the Reman Dynasty, which describe the city as straight and glimmering, ""a hypnotic swirl of ramparts and impossibly high towers, designed to catch the light of the sun and break it to its component colors, which lies draped across its stones until you are thankful for nightfall.""

And so on, with many other examples I could dig out. Now, seeing as most of these fantastical cities haven't been featured in a modern ES game, this game will basically nail down the new lore for them. Seeing as they managed to screw up the IC despite it being the only city they really needed to focus on in Oblivion, having them take on ALL these cities in ONE game will be a disaster and ruin the magic of the ES world. Reading about these cities is pure magic, and now they're inevitably going to mess everything up and make it as bland as the IC, because they've taken a bigger bite than they can chew. There's just no way they can pull off the walking tree-cities of Valenwood, the glass cities of the Summerset Isles or the massive graveyards of Necrom in *one game*.

So yeah... That's my biggest fear. They can mess up the combat and gameplay all they want, but taking everything magical you can read about in the books and putting it in to a game in a haphazard way will just ruin everything. Historical inconsistencies can be fixed with CHIM and Dragon Breaks or whatever meta-method you'd like, but the actual look and feel of cities is much more vulnerable. Since Oblivion was released, no one can claim that the IC actually looks as awesome as it was first described, and the descriptions of the new cities will be lazily written off as hyperbole as well, instead of actually living up to the magic.

So, the lore we think we have for the Second Era has, if the MMO is considered canon, been basically erased and replaced by an illogical fan-fiction. A key part of the MMO, however, is that it is set to take place ~1000 years before the events of TESV: Skyrim, i.e. 2E 300-2E 800. This puts the MMO in the time known as the Interregnum, before Tiber Septim became Emperor. As we here in /r/teslore know, Tiber Septim achieved CHIM, giving him the power to do as he pleased with reality itself. He is purported to have cleared the jungle of Cyrodiil for the Red Legions, and this shows the extent of his power. Based on this godlike power that Tiber Septim has achieved, there may be an argument that he had used the powers of CHIM to effectively erase the memories of the people of Tamriel, and reforged the past as he saw fit. My thought is, if he had replaced everyone's memory, he probably did so not with manipulative intentions, but with the intent to unite individual provinces within themselves, and use their internal unity to unite all of Tamriel.

**Theory #2:**
Again, assuming the MMO is canon, the timeframe is the Interregnum, and Tiber has achieved CHIM, we can begin my more conspiracy-theorist-like idea. So Tiber has the power to do as he pleases with reality, and with that power he could rewrite history as he saw fit. Seeing that his power allows him to do so, he does just that. He erases all recent memory of the war raging during the MMO. But, besides just calming Tamriel down a touch, he goes a step further. He tells epic tales of grandeur during the wars that he was a general in. Tales of grandeur that show him doing things that no man could do. That only a god could do. He uses his powers to make everyone think that everything before he actually *achieved* CHIM regarding himself portrayed him as a hero-god of men. Then, using his CHIM powers, proceeded to follow up those tales with **real** exploits and conquests. He used the powers of CHIM to deify himself in others' eyes, and, once he began to truly take on the role of a hero-god, he likely began to mantle Lorkhan/Shezzar/Shor, with Ysmir's help, of course. When he died, he probably completed the mantling process and assumed his divine role.

**OR**

He didn't assume his divine role as Talos, but just died. Just like that. Thus proving the Aldmeri Dominion right (never thought that idea would come from me) to the extent that Talos was not a god. How could they have figured it out? Perhaps Tiber's influence wasn't as strong in Alinor because it wasn't part of continental Tamriel. Maybe some other reason. But, if for some reason his influence wasn't as powerful in Alinor, then perhaps they realized he was a fake after he died and somehow they overcame the CHIM-brainwashing because he was no longer present on Mundus. Whatever made the AD think Tiber wasn't a a god is still ambiguous, and, of course, this is just a theory.

**A few notes:**

* Upon checking [UESP's timeline for the Second Era](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era), there is reason to believe that the MMO could take place any time between 2E 600 and 2E 800, or any time before 2E 560.
* I know Morrowind was in a kind of civil unrest during Tiber's conquests, but perhaps he left it like that intentionally? (I mean think about it, a unified Morrowind would seriously piss off Ysmir and put Tiber at a huge disadvantage) And maybe there's more proof to the Alinor theory because Vvardenfell is separate from the mainland.

That's about as much as I have right now. Please comment with ideas to elaborate on certain theory parts, or arguments to discredit my theories (or dismantle them piece by piece).

If so please note that there are many things that I would change in this piece. Maybe someday I'll rectify it but in the meantime I suggest you use the sources linked to build your own idea of Amaranth.**

The Amaranth

Since it is (was) Easter I thought that I may try and explain a part of TES lore (a la MK) that has interested me for some time: the Amaranth. 
As a preface to this may I warn you that this is in deep MK territory and that you should at the least understand the concept of CHIM and also have the Loveletter at your side. In addition to this please understand that I am no expert in TES lore and that if in some aspects I am wrong please correct me.

So what is the Amaranth?
 To answer that question I must discuss the idea of Sub-Gradients within the Aurbis, since 
&gt;all creation is sub-gradient.

First was the Godhead, the schizophrenic dreamer and in this mania he was split into two:  Anu and Padomay, Order and Change, Stasis and Chaos.

The interaction of Anu and Padomay created the Aurbis and therefore the wheel. From Anu and Padomay sprung their souls Anui-el and Sithis and from these came the Et’ada. 

From the Et’ada: Aetherius and Oblivion did transpire but there was one Et’ada who saw the limits of Order and therefore Aetherius but also the uncontrollability of Change and therefore Oblivion, Lorkhan. Lorkhan who had travelled the vast distances of the Aurbis and had seen the previous Sub-Gradients of Aurbis (Anon; the Wheel) tricked the Anuic Spirits into creating Mundus, a place with the perfect mix of Order and Change where others could see the Tower.

And so the next sub-gradient is spilt into two. Mortal death and CHIM, when one fails to replicate what Lorkhan saw at the edge of the Aurbis in their time on Mundus they die and their souls are sent back to the Dreamsleeve and get recycled. However, when one sees what Lorkhan saw and say “I do exist” they attain CHIM.

Many believe that attaining CHIM is the final sub-gradient of AE, of existence. It is not. Knowing CHIM is merely the leaping point from which one can become the Amaranth.

&gt;“You in the Fourth Era have already witnessed many of the attempts at reaching the final subgradient of all AE, that state that exists beyond mortal death. The Numidium. The Endeavor. The Prolix Tower. CHIM. The Enantiomorph. The Scarab that Transforms into the New Man.”

As we can see from the Loveletter that states that CHIM is one of the many ways that the people of Nirn have come close to reaching this state. If doing so consciously or not is another question.

And now we can answer the question: What is the Amaranth (AKA the new man, the last existence, the eternal I)
As earlier stated CHIM is the leaping point at the bottom of the Tower of sub-gradients, the leaping point to where?  
The leaping point to a new tower full of you
&gt; A whole world of you.

And that is Amaranth, a state of existence where you become the Godhead of your own tower. Not like the schizophrenic Godhead of the current tower but rather as MK puts it “Amaranth, Everlasting Hypnogogic”
Half asleep, half awake. Awake enough to acknowledge it’s own existence but asleep enough to dream his own tower.
 
&gt;The New Man becomes God becomes Amaranth, everlasting hypnogogic. Hallucinations become lucid under His eye and therefore, like all parents of their children, the Amaranth cherishes and adores all that is come from Him.

This is my first attempt at something like this and admittedly I am not the best at explaining things and if anything is unclear (or wrong) please say.

Obviously, the Vigil opposes all Daedra and Daedric worshippers, as well as vampires, werewolves, witches, and any other that essentially bring pain and inconvenience to mortals.  There's the Hall of the Vigilant (which ends up being sacked in Dawnguard) and Stendarr's Beacon, but finding any information past dialogue Vigilants offer in-game has proven difficult.  Even the Elder Scrolls Wiki, UESP, and Imperial Library offer little more than quotes of dialogue and a few books on the subject.

I searched /r/teslore for any information on the Vigilants, and there seems to only be three threads touching on the subject, all with the purpose of determining the level of hostility towards mortals with a possible connection to Daedra (the Companions[werewolves], Dunmer, and Orcs) that determined that, at best they tolerate them, at worst they don't make a move simply because they realize they would be outmatched.

In addition, there are seemingly no quests outside of Dawnguard dealing with the Vigil beyond explaining Isran's desertion of the order and revenge for their destruction.

So I guess I'm asking for any further sources that explain the emergence of the Vigil (beyond ""it showed up after the Oblivion Crisis""), any sort of entrance requirements/rituals(etc.), or possible actions the protagonist of my story could take.

It has been suggested that perhaps he could go around collecting Daedric artifacts to dispose of them.  The most popular ""disposal method"" suggested has been dumping them in the Aetherium forge, which would undoubtedly be successful, but there is also in-game dialogue that suggests there is a vault in the Hall of the Vigilant that they keep Daedric artifacts in for safe keeping (apparently - and this has never happened to me - if a Vigilant passes you and you have a Daedric artifact in your inventory, they will demand that you give it to them so they can keep it in such vault).  Would it make any sense for a Vigilant character to go around to the various shrines and, beyond killing all the cultists for obvious reasons, collecting the artifacts to destroy/safeguard them?  (I am willing to fudge the Vigil's conceptions of right and wrong a bit, but serving a Daedric lord for this purpose seems a bit outlandish, unless the Vigilant was some designated sort of special-ops type role similar to the Dark Brotherhood's Silencers in Oblivion.)

I've been looking for corrupted deity names, since most cultures seem to have similar names for deities. I have not had much luck

""Goora"", is evidently significant. It sounds a little bit like ""Azura"" (By Azura by Azura by Azura!) but I can't really think of any good reason why the Rieklings and Azura would have an interest in each other.

""Hawala"" maybe a *teeny* bit like ""Herma Mora""; Herma Mora, Hermara, Hermala, Hawala. Dunno. Mora's role in the other local religions could suggest a relevance but it's kinda clutching at straws.

I think this for two reasons:

1. Souls travel to the Soul Cairn after being soul trapped and killed, which is an effect of magicka enabled by Magnus. Magnus left Mundus after Convention and the remains of his presence are magicka.
2. The realms of Oblivion are not infinite. The Wheel has 8 spokes (the 8 divines) and the spaces between the spokes are the planes of Oblivion (the 16 Daedric Princes). The Ideal Masters were mortals, not et'Ada or Ada, and while they could possibly use magicks to create a bridge to Aetherius (i.e. Zurin Arctus and the Mantella) it seems unlikely they could alter or construct a plane of Oblivion without the assistance of a Daedric Prince (i.e. Gaiar Alata being created by powers of Dagon in the Mysterium Xarxes).

I want to flesh out this theory more, when I have more time to write, but first I want to hear what the teslore community thinks of the abstract.

**Questions**:

* Have mortals used magick to create planes of existence before? 
* Were those planes within Mundus, or Aetherius? 
* In the case of Gaiar Alata, was it an independent realm or an allotted portion of the Deadlands? (if we know)

If Camoran's Paradise is a segment of Dagon's realm, then I would conjecture that the Soul Cairn is an allotment of Aetherius under Magnus's influence.

The Translated Text of a Maormeri Oracle Bone, as Translated by Atticus Plinius


*Author’s Note: After the release of my transcription of the tale Raid on Pyandonea, I made a series of inquiries throughout the scholarly community regarding the Maormer, and Pyandonea itself. Existing sources are sparse, and my inquiries failed to draw up anything significant until I received the underside of an old shell, covered in inscriptions. The shell underside—which appears to have been taken from the shell of one of the rare breed of reptiles known as ‘turtles’—came from an anonymous source without a note, and thus all I can draw from it is what is inscribed upon the shell itself. The bulk of the text appears to be an Aldmeris derivative, but there are traces of Ehlnofex, Daedric, and Ta’agra scripts throughout. The inscriptions are heavily damaged, but a self reference to the text as an ‘Oracle Bone’ leads me to believe, with reference to Raid on Pyandonea, that this is, in fact, a Maormeri text. Amazing! Now, just as Raid of Pyandonea may have been a forgery of relatively recent generations, this ‘Oracle Bone’ may be a forgery of the immediate present. But the anonymity of the source should not stop one from reading and perhaps even trusting this transcription.*

Oracle Bone Text 1341 B of the [untranslatable] School, Isle 3A


The Sixteen Princes of [Oblivion]: Attributes, Encounters, Etcetera


[Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent?]: Malefactor of the Maormer people, Colored Snake that Slithers Across the Sky, Teacher of the Plumed Elves in [the North-Continent], Trickery Serpent, Inheritor of Lyrkhath’s Deceitful Role. During the early years of Mund, Magraashess banished her son Plume-Raindbow’d-Serpent from the sky, for Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent had plotted to oust his mother from the heavens and take leadership himself, even going so far as to consort with [the-Hungry-Serpent], planning to allow the-Hungry-Serpent into the sky beneath [the-black-sky] to aid him. When Magraashess banished him, he grew furious and homesick, wishing to having a place in the sky proper once more, rather than only as the Colored Snake that Slithers Across the Sky (Aurora?). He thought and thought and hatched a deceitful plan that would grant him some small solace. He sought to sink all the lands, so that the sea may reflect the sky and allow him hollow comfort. He began with our land, Pyandonea, which was then whole, and persuaded the [Earth-roots? Earth-Serpents?] who rule below the earth as the dragons rule above it to loosen their roots and allow the land to sink. Because Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent came under the guise of a representative of Magraashess and Lyrkhath, many Earth-Serpents listened, and much of our land sank, and that is why our land today is a mass of islands with sheer cliff faces. Many Earth-Serpents did not listen, and were soon attacked by their brethren while defenseless. They cried out to the Sea Serpents, who went to the Maormer and the First King Orgnum who was [Serpent-blooded] and [Auriel-Incarnate] and demanded assistance. The King Orgnum came with the Maormeri fleets at his back and the [text lost] below, and fought against Plume-Raindbow’d-Serpent and drove him from the land. He then turned his attention upon the Earth-Serpents who had betrayed their kin, and went to war with those who remained stubborn, devouring them and their souls [because he had to]. Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent’s story continues past Pyandonea; ejected from our land, he fled to [North-Continent], but found that most of the Earth-Serpents there refused to heed his words. Some did, but he chose to maintain them as allies for the future rather than immediate Earth-Sinkers, and they became his [Plume-Rainbow’d-Serpent-Children].

Raid on Pyandonea is done. [Here it is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170264/raid_on_pyandonea/)

~~I'd like to share an idea with all of you. You may want to read this[1] if you'd like as much context as possible, but be warned, what you see there certainly isn't a final draft. I intend to heavily revise it, especially now that the editor (Haute Quêteure from the Editorial Initiative from lore forum) I was working with has gotten his notes on it back to me.~~

~~To sum up the Raid on Pyandonea in the event that you choose not to read it, an old Atmoran fleet of Ysgramor's time has been voyaging around Tamriel, and has reached Pyandonea. After a battle at sea, the Atmorans set up camp on the beach. Orgnum approaches their camp and challenges the Atmoran leader, Dreadmund (who is an Ysmir), to a duel. Orgnum metamorphoses into a great Serpent and Dreadmund metamorphoses into a great Dragon, and they fight. (I know, far-fetched, but it is more or less adhering to the old Nordic tradition that ""there's no better way to use up time without wasting it than by telling a good story."" If I ensure that the story's good, it isn't far-fetched that the Nords would make up something like it.)~~

~~Now, on to my idea, my theory.~~

~~I have a feeling that King Orgnum is an elven, inverse Ysmir. I have a feeling that Orgnum is not the name of a single individual, but a title of the Maormer breed of Ysmir.
~~
~~For one, the myth of Orgnum's banishment from Old Aldmeri could simply refer to the schism of the Maormer from the Altmer. If it does indeed refer to a specific individual, that individual could have been the First Orgnum. And this here, from PGE 3: ""For much of Summerset's history, the Maormer have launched attacks against their sister child of Aldmeris. Every one of these battles have been led by Orgnum himself who it seems is not only immortal but grows more youthful by the century."" Because (an) Orgnum is defeated each time the Maormer travel north to invade, particularly noting the example of the invasion that was stomped out by the PSJJJ's storm, the only instance of the defeat of (an) Orgnum that was recorded in detail, (""King Orgnum and all of his ships had been utterly annihilated,"" implying (the) Orgnum's death,) I take this to mean that each time an Orgnum dies in battle, a new one takes his place, a younger Orgnum. This is a blatant twist of words, but it's an interesting twist on something that otherwise brings one to the conclusion of, How is this guy still a grown man if he grows younger constantly?~~

~~We have no detailed description of Orgnum. The Orgnum that is spoken of could easily be many different individuals. And now, on to the direct explanation of the inverse-Ysmir thought. According to PGE 1, Orgnum is ""said to be the Serpent God of the Satakal."" My knowledge of Yoku mythology is rough, but I take that to mean that Orgnum is said to be Sep. The Serpentine Lorkhan. If each Orgnum is a warrior who follows Auriel/Aka('s will) and is blessed by Sep (a 'Serpentborn'), well, then the Orgnums are then inverse Ysmirs, as Ysmirs are warriors that follow Shor('s will) and are blessed by Aka (the Dragonborns). And, in my text at least, it is assumed that the Dragonborns and Serpentborns can literally turn into Dragons and Serpents, which is hinted at with Dragonborns (citing the YS-GRA-MOR situation and Olaf One-Eye's fictional story) and with Serpentborns (citing the reference to Orgnum as the Serpent God of the Satakal). Hell, while I'm entertaining fancies, perhaps while the Last Dragonborn was defeating Alduin, an Orgnum in Pyandonea was defeating Alduin's Serpent equivalent Satakal.~~

~~Now, this is outright, barely founded speculation. But I like it, and it seems to fit, to a certain degree. Although my speculation is built upon only a few supports, I feel that those supports are strong.
~~
~~As an aside, the situation at the end of the Raid on Pyandonea (in which the Atmoran Dragon throws the Maormer Serpent's Heart into the horizon, mirroring Auriel's launching of Lorkhan's Heart) is fairly interesting from this perspective, because it hints that perhaps the blessers overrule the masters, what with the Shor-follower Atmoran mirroring Auriel's act and the Aka-follower Maormer mirroring Lorkhan's defeat.~~

~~I'd love to hear some thoughts as to whether or not this theory is feasible at all. If it sounds good and fits together (although built on next to nothing), maybe it has potential as an Apocrypha. If so, I call dibs. And if the theory isn't feasible, I'll likely pursue it anyway, because I'm sure that the Nords would happily turn a mythic enemy-hero into an intrinsic opposite of their own heroic staple, despite indications that enemy-hero is not an intrinsic opposite such as that. But again, I'd love to hear your opinions. I wasn't planning to make a public post, because I intended to horde the idea to myself until such a time that Raid on Pyandonea was finished, fixed up and fattened up (I've only corrected a little bit since Haute sent me his notes), and then extend the saga to include this theory, likely by way of having Dreadmund fight a new Orgnum after defeated the other. But Xenoposeidon convinced me after I sent the theory to him.~~

~~Incidentally, anybody who happens to be following the Luftahraan project should close their ears to all references to Dreadmund. Or get very excited.

Your domain is not  magic but mere void, for the Avatar of the Dragon is greater than any spell or enchantment.

1365470501.0,30,self.teslore,1byjl1,On the History and Politics of Akavir.,alexxerth,40,10,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1byjl1/on_the_history_and_politics_of_akavir/,"Continuing my studies on the continent of Akavir, I move from primarily Tsaesci based study, to a rather larger scale of the entire political landscape.

The continent has a very different political climate than Tamriel, which has, at the time, only two major empires, and then some smaller nations, which are still very powerful. Instead, Akavir has at least four major empires, with many other smaller nations (I mean very small, to the point where they are likely the size of a single hold)

The four largest empires are Kamal, Tsaesci, Tang Mo, and Ka Po'Tun.

These are well known, so I will be brief on the individual summaries of each nation.


Tsaesci (Pronounced Say-Es-See)- This nation is one of snake-men (though it's unknown exactly how snake-like they are, see [On the Tsasesci Species](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bpa01/on_the_tsaesci_species/) for more information). They are vampiric, and feudal, though the two are not exactly related. Their primary source of both food and labor is goblins. The feudal nature comes into play here, as they Tsaesci themselves are all the 'lords' of this relationship, with the goblins playing the serfs. Rather than working for protection, they work to avoid being eaten. They are largely peaceful, as the townsfolk are known to leave towns immediately when an approaching army draws near, but they do have a large army capable of defending or attacking as needed.



Tang Mo- Perhaps one of the most interesting of the nations. These are Monkey-people (perhaps similar to the Khajiit, but with monkeys, though not much is known here really) who live in an area with many islands. This nation is largely unorganized, but is one of the most peaceful nations on the continent, and the people are very nice. They are able to muster up an army if they need to, indicating some form of organization.

Kamal- This literally means ""Snow Hell"". It's not quite known what the people here look like, but they are called demons. They have some form of Monarchy, as they do have a king. The people here actually freeze solid each winter. 

Ka Po'Tun- This empire is the most powerful empire on the entire continent, and is inhabited by cat-like people (possibly related to the Khajiit, though more tiger-like). There is a central leader, who is essentially immortal. They are terribly at naval battles.


Other races/nations: For completion, I feel like I should go over the other nations and races that are known. There are, or were at the very least, two races of dragons; black and red. There were, or are, men on the continent. There are Goblins, as discussed earlier.


The earliest history we know, the first political interaction was the Tsaesci eating the men. Whether this was literal or figurative is not known, but I tend to take it figuratively (see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bpa01/on_the_tsaesci_species/)). After this, the Tsaesci decided they also wanted to 'eat' the dragons on the continent. They enslaved the red dragons, later to use them as war mounts. The black dragons fled to the nation of, what was then, Po'Tun (literal translation; Tiger Empire) and it became Ka Po'Tun (Tiger-Dragon Empire). At this point, a great war broke out between the Ka Po'Tun and the Tsaesci nations, one that severely weakened both nations, and killed off most of the dragons (Some who may have fled to Tamriel, though this is conjecture). The goal of the people in Ka Po'Tun since this time, is to literally turn themselves into dragons. It's not known how they plan to do this, but at least one has succeeded, the immortal central leader; Tosh Raka, a Tiger-Dragon (Complete with orange/black striped scales). This is the absolute largest dragon in all of Nirn. This is about where our linear history ends actually, but there is more general history available.

After this, the political climate thawed out a bit. Speaking of thawed out, it should be noted that Kamal launches yearly attacks on Tang Mo, every summer when they thaw out. The Ka Po'Tun help in defending the Tang Mo from the most modern source we have, but this was not always the case. Tang Mo was almost enslaved by every other major nation on the continent. At some point after all of this, the Tsaesci invaded the Empire, failed, and were invaded by the Empire. Our knowledge of history ends here, as there have been no further expeditions or attacks since 3E 290.

Other than that, there are also many smaller nations strewn about the continent, though it is not known how many, of what races.


Outside of the continent, it is not known if there is much interaction. They are certainly capable of traveling outside of the continent, but seem content with not doing so as of late. The islands of Cathnoquey, Yneslea, Esroniet, and Roscrea, as wella s the continent of Pyandonea lie between Tamriel and Akavir, 

It is interesting to note that the Tsaesci invaded Tamriel, and replaced the Empire for 200 years, and they aren't even the most powerful warriors on the continent.



Modern Akavir is difficult to discuss.  While many presume it is warring within itself, the situation is likely slightly different. It is likely that Kamal is continuing its attacks still. Other than that, the Tsaesci might not even exist at this point. Bad blood existed between the Tsaesci and the Ka Po'Tun for a long time. With the severe weakening of the Tsaesci after their attack on the Empire, and the Imperial attack on them, it is possible that the Ka Po'Tun, allied with Tang Mo, easily took them out. It is suspected that the Ka Po'Tun's Tiger-Dragon leader may be planning to attack Tamriel, but this is a little known subject.  If this does occur; grave devastation would be brought upon Tamriel.  It is unlikely that the forces of Tamriel would be able to oppose such an attack.

1365123264.0,31,self.teslore,1bpa01,On the Tsaesci species,alexxerth,41,10,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bpa01/on_the_tsaesci_species/,"My theory here is simply that the Tsaesci is fully humanoid.

The evidence for this is varying, and fairly large, but I'll try to keep it brief, so I'll put this in bullet format, with more information below.  **If you want a quicker read, skip to part 5, and that contains the most convincing evidence**


1. There is little consistent information on the appearance of the species.


3. Much of what can be said is likely mistranslations or propaganda.

4. The genetics don't add up.

5. Developer commentary on this is still open to interpretation.

6.  Several key pieces of culture don't fit quite right.


So there are the points, now I will go into further detail on each one in order.

Firstly: There is little consistent information on the appearance of the species.  Some sources state them as being entirely snake like, some only snake on their bottom half, while their top is human.  Most sources are consistent that they do have golden scales though, so they are snake-men in this way, keep this in mind as it is important in part 4.


Second: Much of what can be said is likely mistranslations or propaganda.  While the race is likely vampiric, it is unlikely that they ate people, and this was rather a mistranslation and that they likely absorbed another culture of people.  If you think of it, if a race was large enough to be established on Akaviri, where the Tsaesci already existed, it would be unlikely that they would be entirely destroyed.  Furthermore, they were somewhat snake-like, but not entirely so.  These two things allowed Tamriel's writers to puff up the details, and purposefully 'mistranslate' information, in order to make them seem scarier and gain support for the war.  The fact that the book ""Pocket guide to the Empire, 1st edition"" states nothing on the snake-body of these people, and is the only text I found written after the potentate (to remove a bit of bias), casts doubt on this as well.

Third, and this one is up for debate within other lore; the genetics don't add up.  Humans can not mate with another species, it wouldn't create an offspring.  We know that humans could mate with the elves fine, and the Aldmer might have mated with great cats and made Khajit (I don't personally believe that theory), so it's possible that there could be inter-species relations.  However, if the Tsaesci are truly half-snake, or full snake, then there would be no...matching parts so to speak. Regardless of that, snakes have eggs.  If this understanding of genetics doesn't really apply to TES, then cast this entire point away and leave it in the dirt, I'm confident in the rest of the evidence.

Part 4 speaks of the developer commentary on the subject.  In Oblivion, there were ghosts who were simply Imperials.  Michael Kirkbride said that this was nothing more than a limitation, and that they are ""Immortal. Vampire. Snakemen.""  Notice the last word. ""Snakemen"" This indicates that they are, at the very least, not full snake.  As I said in part 1, they could just be men with snake-like scales.  This still fits that description.  This is also why they are vampiric.  However, this is MK's words, so it can be contradicted later.


Part five is where I draw the bulk of the evidence from.  First, a bit of cultural evidence:   The blades, and for that matter much of Imperial culture, comes from Tseasci.  Blades armor has leggings though.  Why would a people with a large snake like lower body need leggings?  Of course the option that the Blades simply added that part, and the original Tsaesci armor did not have this comes up, and therefore this bit of evidence is minimal at best.  However, another cultural point comes up; the dragon symbol on Imperial armor.  Where did this come from?  Well the answer is that is not actually the Tsaesci, however their presence did reaffirm the symbols worth.  This was because the Tsaesci's chosen war mount was dragons.  Think about this for a few minutes.  Perhaps I should have put this first, as this is likely the best piece of evidence.  Find out why yet?  How does something with one long slithery lower body **mount a dragon**?  It can not be done unless they physically tie themselves down, or hold on with their arms, either way making it an ineffective and ultimately useless mount.  They would need legs to properly ride a dragon.





So there you have it.  With all that written out, I have to say firstly; Thank you for reading.  Second; I am a relatively new scholar, and especially new to the field of Akavir, but I cross-checked this information so it should be 99.99% accurate.  However, there is of course the option that I missed information somewhere that could help or hurt my point.  Please do post this, as I am interested in determining the true form of the Tsaesci.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Dwemer,True,t3_1bpa01,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bpa01/on_the_tsaesci_species/,

You might've noticed a bit of a difference in this week's Community Thread - *I'm* doing it, not xeno. Our friendly neighborhood Hist-sucker is away from his desk in Lilmoth, and will be back on the 22nd. In his stead, I'm leading this week's Community Thread, and Rhys'll take the next one. Obviously this isn't my usual job, so if this is all a little awkward, it's because I have no idea what I'm doing.

I suppose it's a good time to explain again what these are all about. As you all know, /r/teslore is fairly heavily moderated and irrelevant discussion is swiftly taken care of. While this keeps the general quality of the subreddit's content in a good place, it means we have less room to enjoy the fantastic community we have here more casually. The Community Threads are the resolve - they aren't just summaries of the week gone by, but unmoderated playgrounds in which to enjoy ourselves.

With that out of the way, I'll have a go at this the best I can.

**Weekly Overview**

The subscriber-boom is calming down now (probably a good thing), with ~150 new subscribers this week. Our hand in the memospore events have led to stronger ties with the good folks on the Bethsoft forums, and that's great. Hopefully we've given the impression that reddit isn't *entirely* composed of self-congratulatory regurgitators (or perhaps we've proven it).

The week has seen the production of some great explanations and texts, such as the [second part to *""The Boiche: A Treatise on the Elves of Valenwood""*](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18jmat/the_boiche_a_treatise_on_the_elves_of_valenwood/) by /u/lebiro, /u/Mr_Flippers' [Quick piece on Khajiit and the Aldmeri Dominion](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18d5h5/quick_piece_on_khajiit_and_the_aldmeri_dominion/), and *[""What is Love?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18gt8w/what_is_love/)* by /u/RottenDeadite. A couple of forum-frequents have presented us with their brilliant texts; dinmenel's *[""Tsirelsyn's Bound""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18ozrr/tsirelsyns_bound/)* and Haute's *[""Winterhold Forthrow Headway-Bewrit""](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18p3cd/winterhold_forthrow_headwaybewrit/)*. The past few days have been marked by busy scrambling over the memospore ARG, which you can check up on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18mqw0/memospore_megathread_ii/).

**Scholar of the Week**

If it were possible, I'd give this week's title to everyone actively participating in the memospore ARG; both those folks that have taken the banner of /r/teslore over to the Bethsoft forums (and there are a *lot* of you, I've noticed), and the ones deciphering codes from here (I'm looking at you, IRC-hermits). However, it would be a crime to ignore the passion and dedication of one individual, who put everything on the line in the name of academia. For [this legendary feat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Wp9E0al8E&amp;feature=youtu.be), it is only fitting that this week's title goes to **/u/Gerka**. You're a real hero.

That's all I've got. I'd just like to say thanks to the people who've PM'd me about updates regarding the memospores - you've been a big help in keeping the Megathreads up-to-date (funnily enough, I'm behind on updating them at the moment, but I'll get there).

Other than that, have a great week, everyone.

1357906669.0,32,self.teslore,16djjd,New Words by Clan Mother Ra'Paahrmi,Mr_Flippers,40,8,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16djjd/new_words_by_clan_mother_rapaahrmi/,"These words are here for kittens to know more about Khajiit and the worlds birth, so Ahnissi's words would not be all to record.

Ra'Paahrmi knows you read this after Ahnissi's tale. She knows you know of Ahnurr and Fadomai, she tells you more now.

First, Fadomai wants children to share their happiness. This was different to what Ahnurr wanted, but Ahnurr did not mind, this difference was Fadomai's nature.

They had their first cat, Alkosh. Ahnurr told Alkosh “we give you time, Alkosh, for what could vary speeds more than a cat?”. Alkosh was most important for time, for Alkosh's children would become parts of time themselves.

And then came Khenarthi, the Winds. Khenarthi was very important, for not even Alkosh the elder could fly as high as Khenarthi's winds.

And then came Magrus, the Cat's Eye. Magrus was important, for the light from the sun would shine into the children of the future.

And then came Mara, the Mother Cat. Mara had not her own children until later, but she was mother in nature from the beginning and thus came love. The love was more important than even the first litter could know.

And then came S'Rendarr, the smallest and weakest of the litter. S'Rendarr was important, for he could only survive by mercy and mercy he gave unto others.

Many phases past and something changed. Ahnurr wanted the children this time and Fadomai tolerated the idea. It was very strange that Ahnurr would want more, but Fadomai agreed.

Fadomai then gave birth to the next litter. The next litter was strange, for not even the Clan Mothers know exactly how many were born, or even their names, but these we do know.

Fadomai would talk to this litter and to the first of this litter was Hermorah, who was the Tides. Hermorah was the tides, for none could predict what causes the tides, yet Hermorah would know.

Hircine, the Hungry Cat, was next. Hircine was hungry for none could hunt better than a hungry cat and the hunt was Hircine's nature.

Merrunz came after, who was the Ja'Khajiit. He was and is so young for the kitten cannot understand it's destructive nature, but will always act on it.

Mafala the Clan Mother followed. Mafala was the first Clan Mother, for her knowledge was exclusive and would impact others.

Sangiin the Blood cat came after. Sangiin was blood, for the urges of blood could not be controlled.

Finally came Sheggorath, the Skooma cat. Shoggorath was insane and noisy, for that is the nature of skooma.

Ahnurr was no longer patient and told Fadomai “We have had our litters, our happiness can be shared, but we cannot allow the children to steal our happiness”.

Khenarthi was lonely in her height where none could travel, so she went to mother Fadomai and told of her lonesome. Fadomai pitied lonely Khenarthi, so she tricked Ahnurr into another litter.

They gave birth to Jone and Jode, the moon-siblings, and their movements. Then came Nirni, the lush forests and magnificent sands. Finally came Azurah, the dusk and the dawn.

Jone and Jode were happy together, but Nirni and Azurah would always fight for Fadomai's favour.

Whilst still birthing the last kitten, Ahnurr found Fadomai and was enraged by this. Fadomai was struck by Ahnurr, but fled away to birth her last kitten. The children had heard of what Ahnurr had done and swiftly came to protect her from Ahnurr's wrath.

Finally, Fadomai gave birth to Lorkhaj outside of the usual birthplace and within the Great Darkness. Because of this, the Heart of Lorkhaj was filled with Great Darkness. When Fadomai was birthed into the darkness, the darkness become more and knew what it was. The Darkness became Namiira.

Fadomai knew she had little time to live and talked to Jone and Jode, giving them the gift of the Lattice; with this gift they became forever moving. Their movements would block Ahnurr forever from harming Fadomai and her children. Ahnurr growled and shook the heavens themselves, but he could not shake off Jone and Jode's protection.

Then Fadomai went to Nirni and told her she would birth as many people as Fadomai did. Nirni was pleased, but looking over at sister Azurah, she saw Azurah with nothing and was very happy.

Then all of the children had left for Fadomai to be in peace with her death, except for Azurah. Fadomai told her Azurah was her favourite daughter of all and with this, she was given the greatest gift of all. She told her three secrets. Then Fadomai told her “When the children of Nirni are born, take one of them and change them. They must be the fastest, cleverest and most beautiful people and you will call them “Khajiit”. Khajiit will climb better than all of the other children, for if Jone and Jode are taken off course, they must climb Khenarthi's winds and return their gift. Then she told Azurah that Khajiit must be the best deceivers from Nirni, for they must always hide their nature from the children of Ahnurr, who can do what Ahnurr no longer can. Finally, Fadomai said that Khajiit must be better survivors than any other people, for Nirni will be jealous of your gift and try to hurt Khajiit in spite of them and change their land, making Khajiit always hungry and at war with Nirni.

And right before Azurah, Fadomai died.

Many phases passed and Nirni came to Lorkhaj telling him “I was told to birth many children like mother Fadomai, but I have no place for them”. Lorkhaj told her “Lorkahj will make a place for these children and Lorkhaj will put you there so you may birth.” But Lorkhaj was a tricky cat and deceived many of his older siblings. The first litter would fall for Lorkhaj's tricks, but the second litter were cautious of Lorkhaj and chose to not be involved.

When making the new place, our home, the first litter were being weakened by the building and before finishing the new place, Magrus and his followers ran away, into their own realm where they escaped Lorkhaj's harmful tricks. But Alkosh and his followers stayed to finish it, for Alkosh had his own plans for the new world. When many of Alkosh's followers died or were weakened to make Nirni's path stable, the survivors went to Lorkhaj in anger. Alkosh and his weakened siblings cursed noisy Lorkhaj, so that he would walk Nirni for many phases away from his brothers and sisters. Alkosh ripped out the heart of Lorkhaj with his claws and hid it away, deep within Nirni.

Nirni was upset but, as a mother, soon forgave her brother as now Nirni could birth her children just like Fadomai had birthed her after Ahnurr was tricked.

Alkosh had birthed his own children, but the first one was most special. Alkosh went to his mighty son and told him “when Alkosh chooses the time, I will wake you from your sleep and you will be hungry. When you wake, you will devour all of Nirni's children, but I also bless some of Nirni's children to write my history. If you become greedy, Alkosh and Nirni's children will fight you back into slumber until you learn humility”. The first-born understood and rested. Some men in the mountains today claim they know the first-born by name, but if the Clan Mothers do not know, who could?

Nirni was sad, for she had birthed so many children, but her favourite people in the forest did not know their true form and were confused. Azurah spoke to her sister from a distance and said “stop crying, sister. Azurah will gift you with new people”. Azurah then told her siblings Jone and Jode the first secret and they let her pass. Azurah then took some of the forest people who were confused, unknowing if they were mer or beast. Azurah called them Khajiit and her secret knowledge let her form them into all different shapes, so that even if one could not complete a task, Khajiit could work towards it and complete any goal as Khajiit. Then Azurah told them the second secret and Khajiit learned the value of keeping secrets. Azurah then bound them to the Lunar Lattice, as the secret defenders of Nirni must be. Finally, Azurah spoke the third secret to Jone and Jode, from then the moons worked with the sun Magrus had left to shine light into the marshes and the light became sugar.

However, Y'ffer overheard the First secret and sneaked in to see Nirni and told her of Azurah's trick. Nirni made the deserts hot and the forests wet and poisonous in anger of her sister Azurah. Nirni thanked Y'ffer and let him change forest people too. Y'ffer did not have Azurah's secret knowledge though and made their people always Elves and never beasts and they were called “Bosmer”. Nirni was so pleased with Y'ffer's loyalty that she chose to not change the forests of the Bosmer and Khenarthi made a deal with them to ensure their gift. From that moment, Bosmer were no longer in the same litter as Khajiit.

Y'ffer, in his ignorance, shouted the first secret across all of the heavens so all of Fadomai's children could cross the lattice, but Y'ffer did not realise the problem with his shouting. Azurah quickly closed the ears of angry Ahnurr and noisy Lorkhaj so that they alone could not hear the first secret, for such knowledge could put all of Fadomai's descendants in danger of Ahnurr's claws.

&gt; Nocturnal is accorded the title Ur-dra by nearly all the Royalty of Oblivion. As the mother of night, she claims to be an aspect of the original Void itself, and it is generally deemed best to fortify this declaration in one’s evening prayers.

Notice the title, Ur-dra.

Ur: Original, First

Dra: Ancestor

The Daedra have given her the title of original ancestor, which fits with her claim that she is an aspect of the void itself. And her direct influence over luck and shadows seems to confirm her crucial place in the Aurbis.. 

Now when speaking of the Aurbis and Thieves it is only natural to start talking about CHIM and the Tower. 

From [Vehk's Teaching](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/vehks-teaching):

&gt; The Tower is an ideal, which, in our world of myth and magic, means that it is so real that it becomes dangerous. It is the existence of the True Self within the Universal Self, and is embodied by the fourth constellation, and is guarded by the Thief, the third. The Thief is another metaphorical absolute; in this case, he represents the “taking of the Tower” or, and sometimes more importantly, the “taking” of the Tower’s secret.


The Tower is an ideal, created by the Wheel, which was viewed by Lorkhan

&gt; As the gods and demons of the Aurbis erupted, the get of Padhome tried to leave it all behind for he wanted all of it and none of it all at once. It was then that he came to the border of the Aurbis.


&gt; He saw the Tower, for a circle turned sideways is an “I”. This was the first word of Lorkhan and he would never, ever forget it.

Now if Nocturnal is indeed an aspect of the original void then it would stand to reason that she too has seen the Wheel and the Tower and the I that is CHIM.

I imagine a crushing loss of self, before a descent into a single conclave of mind bent on obeying him. Without further ado, here we go.

.

.

.

Pain! The Kaan-metal hammer pierced my head, cracking skull and will. The tiny Bron pulled the cold metal from my wound. I spat out bone, and tried to roar, but felt the cold sleep coming again. Then, something different. I felt alone, as if I were pulled from tiid and kopraan, and I heard a great wind rush towards me. I saw my ruined body, then saw the arrogant little man, and a cold pang ran through my mind. Moments before I was wrenched from my body, I cried out ""Dovahkiin! No!"", but it was too late. 

Darkness. There was nothing. I was alone in nothing. I am not dov, yet I am all dovah. I felt the Void, but the Void was uncaring. Suddenly, JUN AND SULEYK. A Voice cried ""Force!"" unsure, unsteady, but dripping with life. I felt like I were craning my neck, but I had none to stretch out. I felt the rays of the krein, but all I saw none. Then, as soon as it had come, the light, the power, the warmth, all were gone. The darkness returned, oppressive, yet indifferent.

.

Solitude. I was alone. I felt nothing, only the absence of scale and fang. The little, fleshy dov called out with Voice strong and clear again, and again I felt the rush of his power. I felt this many times afterwards, but never quite as clear as the first time. I felt him grow, as a kiin learning dovah zul. His Voice grew stronger, clearer, yet he only spoke Force. I was puzzled, if such a thing is real. Am I existing enough to feel such a thing in hahdrim? Do I even possess one anymore? 

.

Fron. I feel another. Fron! Stay away! You shall find only the Void here!

Too late. The Dovahkiin devoured another, a mere soldier in the army of mighty Alduin. But... Though I should feel krosis, I cannot, for I am I. I am Mirmulnir! I can find myself in the Void, and the other, the sot one. He knows little of the outside world. Perhaps he will recall more when he grows to know the Void.

.

ALDUIN! I FEEL YOUR VOICE! CAN YOU NOT FREE US FROM OUR PRISON?! WHERE IS YOUR POWER OVER OUR SOUL?!

Another. Sahloknir, zeymah-hunter. Unslaad krosis. If the little Dovahkiin has killed even you, and defied our thuri, are any safe? Can any of the dovah escape the nah this little one wields? 

.

Doubt. My minds are in turmoil. I am Mirmulnir, yet Sahloknir, and Nahagliiv, and several nameless kendovah. We are I, and I are we. The Dovahkiin grows stronger by the day. We cry out in one Voice to our brethren, begging them to stay away, yet it does no good. His wrath is an all-consuming yol, and we are but od before it. We stifle the thoughts, but it is in each of our mind... His Voice could be that of legend, stronger than even the Bron of ages past. Could his be the Voice to end Alduin? 

.

ALL CONSUMING PAIN. MORTALITY. ENDS. BREAKINGS OF TIME. WE FEEL THE VILE THU'UM OF AGES PAST. IT TEARS OUR ESSENCE, DESTROYS THEM LIKE SO MUCH DUST IS SCATTERED 'NEATH THE FORCE OF HIS VOICE.

Ours is torture. We know that which dovah should never. We know death. We know what it is to be... finite. 

We know who our thuri is.

He is the Qahnaarin. 

He is destined to end Alduin. Of this, there can be no doubt. Unahzaal dez.

More. More join our mind with each passing day. This is his will, and I bow to our thuri's will. We are his to command, and his Tongue is sharper than any claw. Soon, it will all come to a close.

.

The presence of another. Mey. He cannot stand against the Dovahkiin.

He speaks.

Speaks. To us. To him.

As all are one in mind and Voice.

We will go, to the eyrie, to the Out-Of-Time, to the home of Lorkhan's zii. We will obey.

We will end that which is unslaad.

.

""MORTAL. FINITE. TEMPORARY.""

.

.

It is finished.

.

Ours is a new master. I give his Voice our strength, we give his mind my knowledge. He seeks others, to bring them under his tyranny.

And soon...

Soon indeed.

We will be free.

For no dov can hold back his fellows, once frul los krent. It may last till the end of tiid, but we shall wait. The Void is no longer dark. It is scale and fang and glinting eye. We will be reborn, for the Losei has fallen. He-Who-Devours-All shall soon meet his equal, and there is one greater than even he.

My first question is the whole Nirn/Mundus thing, as I understand it et'Ada came from Anu and Padomay(Sithis?) who in turn came from the Godhead or something? Anyway, the et'Ada were wandering around the Void (I think) and then one (Lorkhan) had the bright idea of creating a new plane of existence. Mundus. Now, here is where things start to confuse me, the et'Ada who gave themselves to creating Mundus are known as Aedra and can be either Anu or Padomay in origin, I think this is because Lorkhan came from Padomay although I could be wrong, anyway, the ones who didn't are Daedra, so, when creating mundus did they give all their power to creating Mundus itself, if so why are there corpses, the planets floating around in oblivion, also why is oblivion even visible in Mundus? Is Mundus just the collective name for all the planets?

Another thing I have read that ALL of the Aedra gave their power for Nirn, is this true? If so then why are there other planets in Mundus if all there power was given for Nirn?

Also, my understanding has always been this, Mundus is the collective name for the planets, each aedra gave all their power for a particular planet and so have 'become' that planet. Lorkhan is the one who gave himself for Nirn. How wrong am I?

Is Nirn Mundus? And the planets are merely how people percieve the Aedea's corpses floating around in Oblivion? 

And Aetherius, what relation does that have to everything? Is Oblivion to the remaining et'Ada as oblivion is to the Daedra? Are there even any 'normal' et'Ada left or have they all been classed as Aedra and Daedra?

Are Anu and Padomay still alive in the Void? Does the Void even still exist with Mundus, Aetherius and Oblivion?

I'm sorry if all this seems a bit convoluted, I'm just very confused about the whole relation between everything. Primarily what defines 'Mundus' and did all the Aedra give their power to ONLY Nirn, if so, why are the other planets there.

Is it just a general, ""I don't like it,"" or something more specific.  I'll start by downvoting it myself so I can reddit in hard mode.

Well, I'm close to done.  It's a little longer that I would have liked, but that's ok.  I was about halfway through with this version when I came across the following excerpt from Volume 7 of ""Songs of the Return"" and almost despaired:

&gt; *They looked with fear at the winged colossus, and from their babblings did the warriors of the Jorrvaskr learn that it was older than even the elves themselves. Of those who wrought it solid from its mother-stone, nothing could be said, but it was known to drive a magic almost as old as Nirn itself, some remnant of the gods' efforts to render a paradise in Mundus before the shattering of Lorkhan.*

Not only would I have had to redo the entire song (albeit closer to my original version), I wouldn't have been able to finish it at all.  I mean, what lit the world prior to Magnus flight?  Was it the Aedra themselves?  A general light?  Was there night at all?  In LOTR, there were two trees that were transformed into the Sun and Moon when they were destroyed by Ungoliant (as well as some of the light being stored in the Silmarils).  In the Bible, there was ""light,"" and then the Sun and Moon were made on a later day.  

Anyway, I just decided that those elves were babbling and the Atmorans misunderstood them.  'Cause so there, that's why.  Here is the song in its current (and close to final) form.  If any of you have any suggestions or any lore corrections, I'd appreciate it.  For the record:

* It takes place just before and after the death of Lorkhan
* Nordic names and totems are used
* Cold Iron remains a ""he"" and the sun a ""she"" because Cold Iron is just iron and can be excused for mistaking the sun's gender.  Give him a break.  He's in love.  
* In a serendipitous turn of events, Kyne's mourning for Shor explains the existence of the Underforge, although it isn't mentioned in the song.  
* Kyne's blessing (and probable anger at elves, or at least favoring of men) also explains why Skyforge Steel weapons and Nord Hero weapons do the same damage as elven weapons, but weigh less.  
* Again, I request and desire your input, even negative criticisms.  I'd like to make this as good as possible.

Fast forward to now and another theory I'm thinking about. Instead of making a new post I thought I might add it here. So here's my edited version /r/TESlore........... Because I like you more.*

Author: Wolf Lesser-Dragon, Cleverman of the Ysmir collective.

Scholars and Mages alike I present to you today the first of hopefully many dissertations and essays to come from our new and prestigious Ysmir collective. As it is the first study of our Institution I thought it'd be wise to begin with a paper on Ysmir, which I feel is appropriate since his name adorns our gates.

**The Importance of Ysmir.**

The famed ""Dragon of the North"" appears many times in Tamrielic history and usually as a bearded hero of Men who massacres the heathen Devils (Elves)  in the name of Shor and sometimes even over the Cyrodiilic Akatosh. The first mention of Ysmir in recorded history is in the book ""Before the Ages of Man[^1](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/ages-man)"" by Aicantar of Shimerene and tells of a warrior-king-who-goes-by-many-names.

&gt; Also during the Late Merethic Era the legendary immortal hero, warrior, sorceror, and king variously known as Pelinal Whitestrake, Harrald Hairy Breeks, Ysmir, Hans the Fox, etc., wandered Tamriel, gathering armies, conquering lands, ruling, then abandoning his kingdoms to wander again.

From that list 2 names immediately come to the fore: Ysmir and Pelinal Whitestrake, and because the author suggests that these 4 heroes are the same we can reason that Pelinal Whitestrake is Ysmir, Dragon of the North (although whether he was the first Ysmir is unknown). Pelin-El, as the Ayleids called him, was a hero of the early Cyro-Nords who helped lead the nascent Alessian Rebellion against their Ayleid oppressors. For these feats many a song was written about him by early Skalds and from the many fragments of these songs ""The Song of Pelinal[^2](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/song-pelinal)"" is formed. From this song we can gleam a lot about his relationship with the Gods which is very important in finding Ysmir's origin. The 2 main Divine (and most important) links to Pelinal are through the gods Shor and Aka. The link to Shor is shown within Volumes 4 and 5 which state that the Nord armies would say that they could see Shor in him and that some even called him a Shezzarine, an avatar of Shor. The connection to Aka-who-also-goes-by-names comes from a quote from Pelinal himself:

&gt;""O Aka, for our shared madness I do this! I watch you watching me watching back! Umaril dares call us out, for that is how we made him!""

Here Pelinal is attesting that his madness is caused by Aka's madness (see Et'Ada, Eight Aedra, Eat the Dreamer[^3](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/etada-eight-aedra-eat-dreamer)) and thus it links Pelinal to Aka.

The next Ysmir to appear in our histories is the Nord Hero-King Wulfharth of Atmora. Wulfharth, similarly to Pelinal, also had songs sung about his heroics and the most famous one (and a favourite of mine) is the ""Five Songs of King Wulfharth[^4](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/five-songs-king-wulfharth)"". Straight away in the song Wulfharth is bestowed with 2 titles; Shor's Tongue and Ysmir, Dragon of the North; and from therein it is plain to see that Wulfharth is an avatar of Shor. The final Ysmir I shall be discussing is Tiber Septim. It is common knowledge within the Empire that the Greybeards announced him to be Ysmir, Dragon of the North, during his rise to Empire and Godhood. We also know that Tiber Septim was a famed Dragonborn who relit the Dragonfires of Akatosh and wore the Chim El-Adabal of legend. Hence Tiber Septim is linked to Akatosh.

Unfortunately though both Wulfharth and Tiber are only connected to 1 out of the 2 Gods but the Arcturian Heresy[^5](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/arcturian-heresy-0) written by Ysmir Wulfharth states that the God Talos was actually 3 different people Hjalti Early-Beard (the Dragonborn), Wulfharth of Atmora and Zurin Arctus (who is not important to Ysmir). Via this Heresy we can see that the Ysmir here is made up of two figures Wulfharth, who provides Shor and Hjalti (anon Tiber Septim), who provides Aka.

Therefore we now have 2 Ysmir's (Pelinal and Wulf-Hjalti) who have links to the Enantiomorphic duality of Lorkhan-Auriel, Shor-Aka and Rebel-King. Since the enantiomorph of Lorkhan-Auriel was a mirror-echo of Anu-Padomay, the figure of Ysmir is another subgradiated echo of the original duality. The result of the first duality was Aurbis and the result of the second was Mundus. The result of the third and final is decided through Ysmir:

YSMIR AS PELINAL: FAILED (for there was no duality)
YSMIR as TALOS: SUCCEEDED (for the duality was embraced)

Ysmir as Talos ""Reached Heaven by Violence"" by which I mean attained Royalty by which I mean achieved CHIM. When Talos saw the myth-echo of Ysmir repeating throughout Un-Void from Aurbis through Mundus into the Starry Heart, he saw the Wheel-Turned Sideways, the I of the Godhead.

I came up with three interesting possibilities and thought I'd share them here.


First we have the **Psijics of Artaeum**. We know that Ceporah Tower already exists on the island but, for a couple of reasons, I think that at the time of the Intercept it was just a tower. The first reason is that since the Altmer had already built Crystal-Like-Law the Psijics had no reason to build their own Tower. The next reason is that Nu-Hatta didn't mention it in the Intercept. Certainly with all the wizards and wise men that had come and gone from Artaeum someone would have recognized Ceporah as a Tower and passed the information along.

So while Ceporah may not have been a Tower at the time of the Intercept, the recent events involving the College of Mages in Winterhold lead me to believe that the Psijics have converted, or are in the process of converting, it into one with the Eye of Magnus serving as its stone. They would likely have the knowledge to do it, and it seems likely that they know of the Thalmor's true intentions of unmaking Mundus so they would have an interest in stopping them. And what better way to do that than making a Tower on an island that can disappear and reappear at will?


Next we have the **Orcs of Orsinium**. It might be a bit of a stretch, but I think there's a possibility that they've built a Tower. And like the Psijics I think they've built it recently, at least since the founding of the third(?) Orsinium. Also like the Psijics, their reason for building it is the same, to stop the Thalmor.

But how would they know of the Thalmor plot, and have the knowledge and means to construct a Tower? We find the answer to that question in Malacath. As a Daedric Prince, he could have knowledge of the Thalmor plot. And he seems to genuinely care for his followers (see his quests in Morrowind and Oblivion), so I don't think he wants them to be unmade. And he certainly has the knowledge of how to build a Tower.  He, as Trinimac, was standing on the zeroeth one when he helped make the first one after all. He might also be able to provide the Orcs with something powerful enough to serve as a stone for the Tower.


Finally we have the **Argonians and the Hist**. This would be another recent Tower, and would also have been created for the same reason. We know the Hist have some power of foreknowledge, since they recalled the Argonians to Black Marsh to prepare them for the Oblivion Crisis. So it's likely that they know of the Thalmor's plan, and have known for some time. Obviously they don't want the Thalmor to unmake the world, and what better way to prevent that than building a Tower in the middle of a swamp that not even a Daedric Prince could invade?

I'm not positive that they would have everything they need to pull it off though. The Hist may have knowledge of how to create a Tower, as they were contemporaries of the Ehlnofey. And they could also very well have something powerful enough to serve as a stone, since they invaded and pillaged the Deadlands during the Oblivion Crisis.

What I find particularly interesting about a possible Argonian/Hist Tower is what the physical Tower might be. The Bosmer Tower was a giant tree that held an entire city inside, and the Dwemer one was a giant warmachine/God. So what kind of monstrosity could the Hist come up with?


So that kind of got away from me. I only meant to write a short paragraph when I started a few hours ago. Criticisms are welcome.

**The Coronation of Eplear**

^(*Foreword and translation by Harman Maurus*)

*The Song of Eplear is a Bosmeri epic dating back to the First Era. It tells the story of King Eplear, founder of the Camoran Dynasty and the modern kingdom of Valenwood, whose unification of the Bosmeri tribes is counted among the greatest military feats of all time. His conquest, needless to say, was a seminal moment in the history of the Bosmer and Eplear remains a giant in Bosmeri history. Strangely, however, his Song has never achieved the fame of the less historical epics of the Bosmer, such as the Dansir Gol or the Meh Ayleidion.*

*The poem itself is vastly lengthy, and more an amalgamation of separate songs and poems. Its verse is all but impenetrable to the translator; too much of the Bosmeri poetic meaning would be lost for the endeavour to be worthwhile. However, the notes, annotations, and comments that accompany many ancient copies of the Song could fill volumes of their own, and it is these I have aimed to collate and translate.*

*This section deals with the coronation of King Eplear, and offers a fascinating insight into First Era Bosmer and the many ancient civilisations that once shared their homeland. While the account (ostensibly factual and prosaic) is replete with poetic imagery and, no doubt, exaggeration, it remains a worthy subject for study, and the best clues we have as to how the first year of the First Era played out.*

After many years of the hunt-against-wise-foes Eplear of the Camorans was supreme among the Boiche. Every tribe and clan had promised itself to Eplear and the green-sap by Eplear’s words or his thousand arrows and blades, and Eplear had welcomed them. All the Boiche were as one and the green-sap was true-whole. The forest rejoiced to know Y’ffre’s touch, and Falinesti graht-oak sang as Eplear climbed to its highest branch.

There he stood, mightiest among Boiche and root of the sap. Atop Green-Sap-Walking Eplear king-of-all saw all his forest and praised Y’ffre that it was good. He promised all things good to Y’ffre who gave all things good to Bosmer. Y’ffre smiled on Eplear, most favoured among most favoured green-sap, and Falinesti graht-oak, most favoured among most favoured green-sap also, rose to walk Eplear king-of-all through the forest. A thousand thousand Boiche followed in the great graht-oak’s wake and the Valenwood sang to see them run through it, as sap through a tree. 

Great Falinesti came to rest at last, as if in summer (for it was summer-of-the-heart for all green-sap). And a thousand thousand Boiche climbed its branches to crown their king-of-all, Eplear Elf-King Camoran.

The greatest graht-oak stretched and sang and grew a new shape, only for Eplear Elf-King, a throne of the green-sap, living wood vibrant in honour of the king-of-all. Eplear sat and his people bowed. Every tribe of the Boiche came to lay gifts before Eplear Camoran, gifts for all the Bosmer.

 Abragoth of the Kahnik gave the head of Great-Gold-Ape-King, war chief of the golden apes who would not promise to Eplear (but not of those who would), and who the Kahnik shot with many arrows for their king-of-all. His bones were golden moonstone, and Eplear ate his face that his skull would be a helm for a king.

Wendilac of the Parikh gave a hundred hundred pearls from the Blue Divide, treasures of Y’ffre’s eyes-in-the-water, now Eplear’s eyes-in-the-woods.

Boleron of the Andrulo gave the hide of a terrible time-lizard, that the great hunter had chased over every footprint.

Hormilrimor of the Guleld gave a feather, which was very beautiful.

Ungalithor of the Liilgur Matilion gave himself to guard the king-of-all with every day, even when joy led him elsewhere.

Silvenar of the Edinil gave his everything-that-is to Eplear to give to all the Boiche to speak.

Oolathar of the Oolathar gave a million arrows of every make for Eplear to shoot a million things.

Kidragon of the Tithihk gave all the colours, every one that is, on his own body.

Yuuligon of the Calobar gave a great dead bug.

Fogorth of the Jalkin gave a hundred vessels of honey that was sweet and good and fit for the king-of-all.

And many other tribes gave many other gifts, and Eplear had many hundreds. And when all the tribes had given all the gifts, others came as well.

The giants gave Eplear a city of Haven. They walked in the sea and made great buildings of stone they fetched, only tiny buildings to them because giants are great-large.

The bird-men of the rivers gave Eplear five-and-twenty tongues of their own, and after he ate them all he spoke them all and sang.

The satyrs of the woods gave a secret, whispered one more benefit of hiding even Eplear had not thought of.  Eplear told everyone the secret because he did not like them, but everyone liked the satyrs’ benefit of hiding.

The centaurs gave Eplear an idea that many things would happen and one day men would rule.

Kulathuah the Keptu gave much tree-flesh that Eplear knew was useful to the clever men.

Juuk the Kothri gave ten strange beasts from far away.

Hadhuul the king of elves-elsewhere gave a handful of magic, which his people were clever at.

And many other peoples gave many other gifts, and at the end of it all Eplear had many many hundreds. And he gave them all to all his people, because the green-sap was true-whole and Eplear wanted only that. He called to the priests of Y’ffre, who were all wise and holy Boiche who knew many things, and knew what Y’ffre wanted almost as well as Eplear Camoran. They climbed to the highest branches with Eplear and placed the golden skull of the Great-Gold-Ape-King on his head and called him king with a song. All the Boiche sang and the forest sang with them, and Jone and Jode smiled to hear such a beautiful song of the green-sap, and listened as they sang for a whole turn.

When the song was done, Eplear took his bow, and one of his million arrows, and loosed it so far and so fast and so strongly that the bow shattered into dust, and the arrow flew higher than Jone and Jode. Eplear never missed, and when some time was passed, the sky grew darker, and the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt fell from the sky to land at the feet of Green-Sap-Walking. Eplear Camoran ate its great elf heart, and much more besides, and tore one great wing from its body. He ate that too, until only a great long bone was left, and that was his new bow, fit for king-of-all. And then Eplear declared that all were his clan, and all the Boiche feasted on the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt until they were full.

After many hours of feasting, and many hours of singing, and many hours of dancing, and many hours of lovemaking, Eplear was king-of-all in Valenwood, Elf-King Camoran beloved by all and all knew. Eplear told the Boiche that Y’ffre smiled on all of them, and Eplear knew no falsehood, and he was right.

We are here because we wish to be here. We live because we walk in the blood of those who dare question our lives; through this we know we are greater for we have reserved our place in freedom. We are not the Old Fools who live for stagnant existence and think they are born with the right to heaven, we know the difference between saying something is ours and taking it.



And who is our guide on our journey? No one. Not Azura, not Mephala, not even Boethiah. If we needed a guide we would have perished already. The men to the north-west have a guide and it is their downfall; they were lead and lost their leader who keeps his body above his test, his heart under flame, his blood under ground, his soul in an old hall and his nature in a bearded voice-murderer; such as his downfall will be their downfall. The Old Fools of Alinor had a leader too, whom harmed himself and cried foul for his own foolishness and as such the Old Fools blame their elders mistakes for they are too blind to see how to move on, as their leader never taught them how. 



Those who do not lead their own lives will perish, those who think such a thing will not happen are those who see their mistake with a blade through the chest. Boethiah is the greatest leader, for he does not tell us to follow but shows us the errors of others and the one true path that makes us realise that the love of stasis is ignorance in emotion; and that even the Doom Drum did not embrace change properly. We are not told to follow, we are shown a path and choose to walk it. None tell us how to live our lives, for if we did we would have failed the test. We follow the beliefs that are proven correct, we live because we have the will to do so. Another could not question this philosophy if we have already killed them. This is why the wise follow Boethiah's path laid to us, for Boethiah knew the death of the Doom Drum and Time-Bird would come and knows their people will follow suit where Boethiah remains glorious, strong and unharmed and wishes the same onto us.



Home is not what we call out and say is ours, but what we build or take and destroy those who claim what we have is not ours. Fire is not ours, but we can manipulate it however we wish for we will it; it may as well be ours. The Northern men have one thing right and that is their invader's spirit; nowhere is too far for their attempts at conquest and much like the 4 cornered House, they serve as yet further testing of our worth. But this does not mean that the more one kills of them the greater he is, that's a philosophy for the thick-headed northerners. But their desire to make their what is in their way theirs is, whilst savage, honourable.



Auri-El is perhaps the worst liar of all, his followers perhaps the most deceived. So much so they still believe his lies. How does one still manage to believe that one such static being could offer salvation? What are they waiting for on that island? Their precious knight to fly into the sun?! They still seem to forget the Trinimac followers became the ugly shame of Tamriel, such a proud warrior turned to filth is what became of the newly termed Orsimer and the same could happen to the Old Fools of Alinor.



Now are the days of testing, where we are the successors whom left the old methods and thoughts of ignorance. We are not of something original, for clinging to the old ways is to follow a path leading to nothingness. We are not of the trickster's teachings, for though his ideals were noble, his actions foolish and he received the death he deserved. But for us, we reserve a prayer for the inevitable:

*The fire is mine; let it consume me*

*And make a secret door*

While trying to join the Imperial Legion, I was directed to an area near the village of Gnisis which I spent quite some time searching for.  Once I found the village, I also found a book, entitled *The Dragon Break Reexamined*. I remembered seeing the same book in Skyrim at some point, so I open it up, and read this: 

""The late 3rd era was a period of remarkable religious ferment and creativity. The upheavals of the reign of Uriel VII were only the outward signs of the historical forces that would eventually lead to the fall of the Septim Dynasty.""

How is this book, available to find in Morrowind, talking about the Third Era as though it's talking about the past, and also talking about the fall of the Septim empire? 


The brilliant conclusion I have reached is: The book is from the future.

That much is obvious of course, but how far in the future is it?  How did it end up so popular in Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim, well before the events in it took place?

One of the more puzzling things about Tamriel from an economic and historical perspective, is that little apparent progress has been made technologically over the span of thousands of years. This is referred to as the [""Medieval Stasis"" trope.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MedievalStasis) Essentially, it does not make sense at first glance that Tamriel is so developmentally stagnant.

**Part the First, The Sources of Developlment**

Before explaining what sorts of things could explain this growth stall, I think it is useful to consider the sorts of things that have caused economic growth and development in the real world. Tamriel, to me, seems to meet most of the advantages that Europe and Asia had according to something like the ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"" theory of growth. Essentially, the climate, flora, and fauna of Tamriel seem adequate. This is unsurprising given the tendency of fantasy universes to appear similar to medieval Europe. 

Additionally, it does not appear that the social or political situation in Tamriel would prohibit the necessary academia associated with technology growth. There are plenty of mages engaged in research, and plenty of historians and such as well (a hint of what is wrong can be seen here, though). I am of the opinion that in addition to necessary conditions of natural resources, there is an important sufficient condition, which is that people are permitted to make a living in the manner they choose. There is actually a quite high degree of personal freedom in most of Tamriel, or at least it's free enough for most people. 

What helped Europe emerge and kick off things such as the Industrial Revolution and Age of Enlightenment was a respect for the right of people to engage in scientific pursuit. Beyond that though, was that these advances were actually used to provide products to people. Merchants were no longer looked at as second rate, and they were permitted to build and trade in the manner they thought best. I see no reason why this would not be true in Tamriel.

**Part the Second, The Mundane Source of Tamriel's Stagnation**

Given that the political and academic freedoms necessary to enter into more advanced economic stages exist, as well as what appears to be a proper endowment of natural resources, it may seem hopeless to figure out what troubles are hamstringing Tamriel.

Well, maybe not hopeless. Searches into past discussions on the topic show a consistently popular theory emerge: magicka is holding back development because it eliminates much of the incentive for invention and scientific research. This is certainly an important aspect.

Yet, despite this, we do not see much practical, in universe application of magic. It's as if we believe that studying electricity would not lead us to create and manufacture light bulbs. Rather, what we see repeatedly is that mages are more concerned with gaining knowledge than actually using it to improve anyone else's lives. And I don't mean that altruistically, I mean that commercially. There is a huge opportunity for profit by simply discovering and manufacturing devices for the common people of Tamriel. 

*So where I place the blame for much of the stasis is not broadly on the existence of magic, but rather specifically on the failure of academics in Tamriel to make true advances in knowledge and a lack of vision in applying knowledge.*

**Part the Third, The Dwemer as Evidence of Magic's Usefulness in Technology**

Some may be skeptical that magic could have much technological use, but the Dwemer are a prime example of the opportunities that modern mages of Tamriel are missing. The Dwemer recognized the great opportunity that magic afforded to them as a source of energy, used to power their steam constructs. Some have speculated that the source of heat in much of their technology was essentially harvested by splitting souls and having them sort of orbit soul gems, which is an explanation for why their animunculi typically have soul gems in them (I fear I am straying too far from the bounds of what I actually know).

Regardless, it appears that Dwemer saw magic as primarily useful for it access to energy. In contrast, the mages of Tamriel seem to lack this vision, rather they focus more on the study of the magic itself.

**Part the Fourth, An Observation on the Behavior of Mages**

As loose as I have been in providing descriptions of Tamriel, I fear I must make one more important observation which I believe is true, but will again be very broad. 

A consistent theme seems to plague the more inquisitive minds of Tamriel. They study either history or magic, and usually some of both. History will provide little instruction into invention, save for the recovery of lost knowledge, and thus poses little threat to breaking Tamriel's Medieval Stasis. Now, not all mages are academics. Quite a few seem to study magic for the sake of the power it gives to them. There are many megalomaniacs that study magic for the goal of destroying or controlling others. In contrast, there are many college mages who seem to study for the sake of knowledge.

It is this allure of pure knowledge which I suppose is the most damaging to Tamriel's development. There is little desire to practically improve Tamriel because of it. When any decent intellect in Tamriel either chooses history or the study of a discipline which seems dedicated to pure knowledge, there is little hope of invention emerging.

Again, this is broad, yet there are repeated examples of the following career path for mages in Tamriel:

* The Mage gains some knowledge
* The Mage learns of some possible implication of that knowledge
* The Mage searches for more, but is faced with increasing peril
* The Mage either dies, is maimed, is corrupted, or nearly killed and frightened from doing any more research
* Regardless, knowledge is lost on the Mage's death and further research is usually precluded

I am sadly but an amateur, and have not included as much evidence as I would like. However, I shall present the following example of a promising mage being snuffed out too early: Morian Zenas.

For those unfamiliar with that name, Morian Zenas is the author of *[On Oblivion](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:On_Oblivion)* and the subject of *[The Doors of Oblivion](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Doors_of_Oblivion)* which was authored by his assistant, Seif-ij Hidja. Hidja's book is the more interesting for our purposes. Both Zenas and Hidja were master conjurers, and they developed a telepathic bond. Realizing this, they made efforts to explore Oblivion, where Zenas would travel the various planes and Hidja would record his observations.

Zenas successfully traverses through five planes (Ashpit, Coldharbour, Moonshadow, Quagmire, and Apocrypha). He is trapped, however in the last he visits: Apocrypha. There, Zenas becomes obsessed with the knowledge contained within. It is perhaps the most pure example of the failures of Tamrielic academia.

**Part the Fifth, A Theory on the Madness that Plagues Tamriel's Mages**

This section will admittedly be the most speculative, but I think offers perhaps one of the better arguments for why Tamriel is in stasis. It is no coincidence that I brought up Morian Zenas.

As written above, I believe the tale of Morian Zenas is a perfect exemplar of the problems of Tamriel's academia. It is a tale of mages frequently searching for pure knowledge and becoming disconnected from the rest of society before that knowledge can be put to any use. Now, why would this pattern repeatedly emerge? Is someone influencing the mages of Tamriel to follow this pattern?

I believe the answer to that question is apparent given Morian Zenas's tale: it is Hermaeus Mora. Who else but the Master of Apocrypha would  repeatedly seduce mortals with the promise of knowledge, knowledge which is repeatedly destructive for those seeking it? 

Hermaeus Mora, the Daedric Prince, whose titles include ""The Gardener of Men"" and is the Prince whose realm includes Knowledge and Fate as foretold by the Future and memories of the Past, is in a unique position to know about technology and magic. It is the temptations that Hermaeus Mora oversees which repeatedly plagues those in Tamriel who should be advancing and applying technology. 

As described in the [*Imperial Census of Daedra Lords*](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/imperial-census-daedra-lords), 
&gt;""Hermaeus Mora, “the Gardener of Men”, claims that he is one of the oldest Princes, born of thrown-away ideas used during the creation of mortality in the Mundus. Imperial Mananauts have verified that his influence on fate and time is real and unfeigned...""

I believe that Hermaeus Mora exerts an influence on Tamriel's mages writ large. Whether this influence is merely is in keeping with his nature, or is part of a desired plan for Tamriel's development is unknown. I suspect it is the second due in part to some circumstantial associations with the Dwemer. For example, in *Skyrim* one of Hermaeus Mora's champions, Septimus Signus, believes that he has found a puzzle box that contains the very heart of Lorkhan. Yet, it turns out that the box contains the *Oghma Infinium* (did Mora move the heart of Lorkhan, or was it never in the box). Furthermore, there is another apparent association with the Dwemer due to the appearance of a Black Book in the Dwemer city of Nchardak. 

The most technologically advanced race known to grace Tamriel has disappeared, leaving behind their creations, and they had an apparent association with the Daedric Prince of Knowledge? That Black Book (which is *Epistolary Acumen*, I'm curious if there is ay significance to which Black Book the Dwemer had) appearing in Nchardak is no accident either, the chamber it is found in appears specially designed for holding it. 

The point is, it seems at least possible that the disappearance of the Dwemer was in keeping with Mora's wishes. I suspect that for some reason, he does not much like technology and wishes to delay its proliferation for as long as possible. 

**Conclusion**

There is no reason from a resource endowment, or political freedom perspective, that Tamriel should have tarried so long at its present stage of development. I do not believe that the existence of magic is in itself enough to explain that lack of technological growth or deployment either. Rather, I place blame on the failure of the scholars and mages of Tamriel to take advantage of a useful source of energy and a lack of vision or desire for practical applications. I further theorize that Hermaeus Mora is strongly impacting the behavior of academics in Tamriel.

**Addendum The First, Thoughts on maxtheman and Malthus**

As pointed out by Mr_Flippers, this topic has been discussed before. One month ago (aprox) maxtheman gave a [fairly good explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16obab/a_new_take_on_the_medieval_state_of_tamriel/) of the Malthusian trap and how it may apply to Tamriel. 

Now, the thing about Tamriel, is that in many parts of it is actually quite advanced from a political perspective. To me, it seems that the rule of law is quite healthy throughout much of Tamriel. 

Yes, war and instability in the wake of the Oblivion Crisis makes it reasonable that not much would progress between the Skyrim Civil War and the Oblivion Crisis, but we are trying to consider stagnation on a scale of thousands of years.

It is also true that human economic development has been grindingly slow for the most part. However, the way out of the Malthusian trap is through technology. So, what seems to set off technology growth, and more importantly, what gets it into the hands of the common people? 

Well, I tend to view this from the perspective that economic historian Deidre McCloskey does. The extremely over-simplified version is that moral development must allow people the dignity to pursue their own ends. McCloskey notes that the hockey stick that is average human income has upticked with the dispersal of ideals that permit greater personal liberty. You can read some of McCloskey [here.](http://www.deirdremccloskey.com/weblog/2011/06/20/chapter-21-of-the-bourgeois-revaluation-it-led-to-a-hockey-stick-of-growth/)

To reiterate, Tamriel actually is fairly free from this perspective. There isn't true serfdom and there are quite a few merchant families. There are certainly opportunities for new technology to arise. Frankly, if there is enough freedom for anyone to dedicate themselves to study of magic, there is enough freedom to develop technology.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1361557966.0,,Psijic,True,t3_18yvbi,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18yvbi/a_treatise_on_the_medieval_stasis_of_tamriel/,

_______________________________________________________________

[The second page of the Mysterium Xarxes](http://images.uesp.net/6/69/Mysterium_Xarxes_P2.jpg) seems to differentiate itself rom the previous page. Tremble from the last statement seems to be the final statement so for now, we shall assume that this marks a new statement. From the very top we are given a new statement:

*Come slow and bring four kes*

Now, what is meant by this? My guess, though a long shot, would be that kes means Keys since Yahkem is commonly omitted. Four keys are required, but for what? To reach Camoran's Paradise, to summon Dagon? What are the four keys? The tribunal's four corners of the house of troubles, which Dagon is a part of? Dagon's four artifacts (his razor, the daedric crescent, the Mysterium Xarxes, maybe the commentaries)? The four volumes of the Mythic dawn commentaries? That being said, one does require all four commentaries in order to be a part of Dagon's cult, so this may very well be the keys.

There are four different bodies of text all staritng out wit a certain number. On the left below the first statement, we get the first numbered text:

*Mother | in m(y) first arm a storm*

We now move on to the second numbered statement on the upper right hand side of the page:

*M(y)-sec-ond-the-rus-h_-of-pla-gue-d_rai-n_*

Which translates to ""my second the, the rush of plagued rain"". We now move to the third numbered statement located at the lower left hand corner of the center triangle figure:

*the third all the tinder of anu*

The final numbered statement located adjacent to the third:

*the fourth the ver_ e_es of padhome*

All these seen to suggests what powers are held within Dagon's hands. The first arm (his upper right hand) holds a great storm of destruction. His second arm (upper left) holds a rain of plagues. Most likely the rain from the storm. The third arm (lower right hand) holds the tinder of Anu. Anu, of course, is the being who fell in love with Nir and impregnated her with life and creation. Tinder is a substance that is flammable. Could the tinder be a reference to the burning hatred Anu had for Padomey when Padomey struck down Nir? Nir's Death could be the ""tinder"" of destruction, since Nirn was on the brink of it when I first was born. The final statement could be translated as ""the fourth the very eyes of Padhome"". Padhome is another name for Padomay. Padomey's eyes lusted for the beauty of Nir. This brought Padomey to strike down Nir and cause the first act of destruction. The last two hands of Dagon seem to suggest that he believes he is the beginning, the being, and the cause of all destruction and change. These four arms may also be a reference to the four keys mentioned before...*hand* ^^^forgive ^^^my ^^^childish ^^^behavior .

Around the triangle holds different tid bits of titles and objects. From top going clockwise:

*to, e-s-tr-o, er-akin-miasma, master-is-master*

Only noticeable thing here is something akin to miasma (nasty smell) and master is master.

The final statement at the very bottom states:

*Be winnowed the timid shall be ble_ at m(y) feet and pra(y) pardon*

The statement suggests that the followers of Dagon will be winnowed from the timid, or ""separated from them by wind"". 'Ble_ at my feet' seems to elude me along with its meaning.  'Pray for pardon' suggests that obviously the Mythic dawn cultists should always beg for Dagon's mercy from the destruction from his hands.

To finish of, the Mysterium Xarxes seems to be more of a summoning rite for Mehrunes Dagon. It tells us of Dagon's plan for the oblivion crisis and what he does for his followers in return for their worship. It holds hymns for him, a summoning chant, and all the works. What does this mean? It means that Mancar Camoran wasn't all that powerful, nor was the actual book. Camoran, during his escape from the blades, most likely summoned Dagon and performed a ritual in order to gain access or paradise. The book is only powerful in the sense that it will help summon Mehrunes Dagon for you. Hopefully we can shed some light on the situation at hand with the power of the Mysterium Xarxes and the Mancar Camoran. You may now conjure your daedra to help bring light to this. Anhaedra may be allowed to enter now as long as his temper is kept in check.

It is often discussed how the different Aedra and Daedra fall into alignment with the original forces of [Anu](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Anu) and [Padomay](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Padomay), with those representing stasis referred to as Anuic and those favoring upheaval and change coined as Padomaic. Though in truth all things are a combination of Anu and Padomay, these terms serve to highlight the ideology of deities, marking which primordial concepts their behavior and actions align them most closely with. Many times the clashing of different powerful beings are seen as echos of the[ archetypal confrontation between Anu and Padomay](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/monomyth), these meetings of titans gain further mythic significance from the reenactment of that original conflict. But as all creation has its roots in the actions of Anu and Padomay these echos could find embodiment in entire cultures, with factions representing the conflicting concepts as they contend against each other. The battle between the Dwemer and the Chimer at Red Mountain, it could be argued, is an example of Anuic and Padomaic races retracing the steps of the very beginning.

The Dwemer represent Anu in their beliefs, instead of worshiping the mixed Anuic and Padomaic Aedra/Daedra, they worship the unchanging and predictable concepts of logic and reason. No other society valued orderly thought as much as the Dwemer. The Chimer were the opposite, fully devoting themselves to the various fluid and changing Daedra, and their philosophy embracing contradictions and disorder. Their most highly revered Daedra, Boethiah, Mephala, and Azura, all revolve around upheaval, deceit, and change. When the Chimer gained the power of a God, they showed this devotion to revolution even further by creating a new type of deity. Doing away with the separation and distance of the past, the Tribunal set up to become Gods that walked among mortals, despite it defying all precedent.

 So when the Chimer met the Dwemer at Red Mountain, it was more than just a meeting of armies, but a clashing of philosophies older than time. The consistent and unchanging laws of reason with the Dwemer, against the wild unpredictability of both the Chimer’s Daedra and their new ideas of divinity. The result of this contest of faiths mirrored Anu removing itself and Padomay from time, as the Battle of Red Mountain led to the elimination of both the Dwemer and Chimer (the Dwemer with their disappearance, and the Chimer in their becoming the Dunmer).

Now to examine the Dwemer as representations of Anu can give us insight into the event of their disappearance. If we except that Dwemer value order and stasis, the theory of them becoming the bronze skin of the Numidium gains credibility. For the Dwemer to become unified as one unchanging material, it would mean purging themselves of their Padomaic aspects left over from creation. This could explain why the Numidium appeared inactive. Perhaps the purpose at that point was not the creation of a new god but for the Dwemer to become a statue, the Numidium serving as the eternal standing representation of order. This theory is not without flaws, as obviously the Numidium did not remain a static symbol, but was traded and used by various peoples, something the Dwemer would of anticipated. 

Instead lets turn our discussion to another popular opinion of the Dwemer’s fate, that they simply disappeared into non-existence. Many see this as the Dwemer’s great failure, the price for their atheistic hubris, but it seems that if their goal was truly stasis then their ceasing to be was really a success. Removing themselves from existence separated the Dwemer from all change, the most static state they could ever hope to reach. This could be the only real desirable end for the Dwemer, as they never would of hoped to reach Aetherius or Oblivion (home of Gods which they don’t worship), and a death when not committed to a deity would just lead to reincarnation back into the muddled irregular world of Mundus. When faced with the inconsistent and fluctuating nature of reality the Dwemer might have come to the conclusion that the logical course of action was to do as Anu did, and step out of being.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Winterhold,True,t3_129i90,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/129i90/the_dwemers_fate_as_an_echo_of_anu/,

A TREATISE ON THE CURRENT STATE OF AFFAIRS OF THE DISPERSED TALOS CULT 

- Written by Codus Arconius, scribe of the newly-reformed Imperial Cult, **revised** by Seradar of Cloudrest, Thalmor Justiciar. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Talos Cult has always been the bastard sibling of the Imperial Cult of the Eight Divines. Even when Talos worship was **mistakenly** legal within the Empire, it's actions and beliefs were deemed too radical and it was illegalised by the Emperor Uriel I in the year 3e 59. Unfortunately the banning of the cult was not enforced at all and so the Cult continued to grow and grow in power and size. The Cults main calling was to ""put a strong man back on the throne of Tamriel"" but many of the more extreme cultists saw Talos as the one true God of the Empire and saw the worship of the Eight Divines as heretical.

Because of their main goal of placing a strong man on the throne of the Empire the Talos Cult took part in many assassination attempts and political coups. The Cult famously took the side of the Wolf Queen Potema during the War of the Red Diamond and were also behind assassination attempts on the Dunmer Empress Katariah Ra'Athim and her delirious husband Emperor Pelagius the Third. The last famous assassination attempt by the Talos Cult was on the Emperor Uriel Septim VII which was uncovered and stopped by an Imperial Knight.

After the successful assassination of Uriel the Seventh by the Mythic Dawn and the resulting fall of the Septim Dynasty caused by the Oblivion Crisis, the Talos Cult grew exponentially. The Cult was divided on what to do next but were in near overall agreement that the Altmer Potentate, Ocato, shouldn't rule the Empire of Man. ~~According to some sources, the Talos Cult aided the [**Withdrawn**] in the Assassination of Ocato~~ (**You should re-evaluate your sources, Codus - Seradar**). After the death of Ocato the Cult, as was mentioned earlier, were divided on whom should rule the Empire next. After much deliberation and arguing the Cult split into 2 with half supporting the Colovian Titus Mede and the other half support the Nibenese Eddar Olin. Ensuing Mede's victory over Olin and his taking of the Imperial City the Cult reformed under Mede's banner. 

The Talos Cult was legalised once again by the victorious Titus Mede I for their support in him and under his rule and Attrebus' the Cult slowly died since they no longer had a purpose. 

We now fast-forward to the year 175 of the Fourth Era and the signing of the **marvelous** White-Gold Concordat. After the signing of the Concordat the Cult's membership burgeoned to numbers higher than ever despite the Concordat forbiddening it. The multitude of members disappeared as fast as it grew however due to our friends within the Thalmor High Justiciary enforcing the Concordat (**Far better than the Septim's attempt at it** - S).

This then brings us to the Cult's current affairs. (**Finally** - S)

Due to the zeal and **rightful** perseverance of the Justicars in their enforcement of the WGC the Cult has diminished to only it's most extreme cultists. These Cultists are of the belief that only Talos is the only true divine and they see the Divines as contemptuous liars who've usurped the position of the dead Aedra. They see the 8 Divines as being the spirits that were created by early man and mer in place of the Aedra who died whilst creating Mundus. Here is an extract of their manifesto.

&gt; Greetings Novitiate.

&gt; Welcome to the path of the one true Divine. Whose name was scolded by the heretical Empire and their blasphemous overlords, whose name continues to be whispered in your heart and whose name is sanctified by our members. 

&gt; Ignore the lies of the Imperial Cult and their Devil friends who continue to worship the names of the deceitful liars known as Akatosh, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth and Julianos.

&gt; These Divines were created by our mistaken ancestors in reverence of the true Aedra who died in creating our home NIRN. The tricksters abused their delusioned worship and used it to fuel their ever-growing ego. 

&gt; I know, Neophyte, that you do not believe us but we are not alone in spiting the worship the Divines. The Demi-God Vivec (Second only to Talos in power) tells us of their deceit in his sermons:

&gt; ""They are the lent bones of the Aedra, the Eight gift-limbs to SITHISIT, the wet earth of the new star our home. Outside them is the Aurbis, and not within. Like most things inexplicable, it is a circle. Circles are confused serpents, striking and striking and never given leave to bite. The Aedra would have you believe different, but they were givers before liars. Lies have turned them into biters. Their teeth are the proselytizers; to convert is to place oneself in the mouth of falsehood; even to propitiate is to be swallowed.""  Here Vivec shows us that the Divines are the deceptive remains of the Aedra, the Givers, 

&gt; Even the great Mages of Artaeum agree that the true Aedra are dead, despite their worship of the egoistic remains:

&gt; ""The magical beings, then, having died, became the et'Ada. The et'Ada are the things perceived and revered by the mortals as gods, spirits, or geniuses of Aurbis. Through their deaths, these magical beings separated themselves in nature from the other magical beings of the Unnatural realms.""

&gt; So there you have it, initiate, the truth. Do you wish to worship the cunning ashes of the Aedra or do you wish to worship Talos a mortal man so great! so powerful! so beautiful! so colossal! so immense! that even the Liars were forced to give way to him.

I hope this is good enough for you Ambassador [**Withdrawn**] and that you found it useful. As always it was a pleasure to work with you.

I've recently [created a new subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/tamrielscholarsguild/) for discussion of magic, politics, and other matters in Tamriel. Posts in this subreddit are strictly in-character, and from the point of view of a scholar in Tamriel. What this means is that we don't know about any writings that have occurred outside of the Elder Scrolls games (and that book about Umbriel), meaning no MK or otherwise. While here in the real world, we can find out exactly what it is that heroes in Tamriel's history have done, however people *in* Tamriel can only guess.

I guess what I'm trying to emphasize here, is that when you are participating in discussions in the Tamriel Guild of Scholars, you don't have access to the wealth of information we do here in the real world, and your posts should reflect this.

You should have a character prepared to post here. Create any kind of character with whatever kind of history, this is the Elder Scrolls after all. An example to help you out is my character, Theodane Barnsmith. He's a Breton, who practises Thaumaturgy, alchemy, and can obviously cast basic spells from other schools. He was born and raised in Camlorn, and discovered his passion for travel and adventure when travelling to Daggerfall for the first time to purchase bloodgrass for a particularly strong chameleon potion.

&gt;**If lore can't be strictly canon or non-canon, how do we tell what's right and what's not?**

&gt;You can't. TES lore, as previously stated, is completely subjective. It essentially means that any individual is free to consider parts of the lore ""true"" or ""untrue"" at will, depending on what they'd like. Of course, some parts of the lore are much less controversial than others. For example, some will consider lore that can't be found in the TES games ""non-canon"", often due to the strangeness and unfamiliar concepts of it that is far from what they can see in the games.

&gt;Here at [/r/teslore](/r/teslore), comments explaining that a part of the lore is ""non-canon"" is not allowed. Given that lore is subjective, telling others how it should be interpreted is wrong, as they are free to decide themselves. The same goes for comments saying things like ""I don't consider this canon"" where it is irrelevant, as it doesn't contribute to discussion.

I've seen an increasing number of ""this is non-canon"" type posts around here lately - which is fair, considering this hasn't been addressed before - so I'm going to try and crack down on it. I don't want to get all Nazi about it, but this is a discussion-based subreddit and these kind of comments are counter-intuitive to discussion, quite simply. If you don't personally consider something ""canon"", don't go to a thread about it and make that known to all. Comments will be deleted.

[Here is a link to the Nu-Mantia intercept.](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/nu-mantia-intercept)

The theory is that there are 8 towers with 8 corresponding stones built from the energy of Aetherius (The plane where the souls of mortals go after they die, and also the source of magic in Tamriel). These towers hold the barriers between Tamriel and Oblivion.

The known towers are:

1) **[Dirreni Tower](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Direnni_Tower)**, also known as the Adamantine Tower or Ur Tower. This was the first Tower, and was built by the Aedric gods. The corresponding stone for this tower is known as the Zero Stone and may be contained within its walls.

2) **[White Gold Tower](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:White_Gold_Tower)**, referred to as White-Gold by the Aldmer, this tower's stone was the Amulet of Kings, which was destroyed in TES4: Oblivion. The elves who built this tower later became known as Ayleids.

3) **[Red Mountain](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Red_Mountain)**, which was destroyed following the events of TES4: Oblivion, its stone was The Heart of Lorkhan, which was also destroyed in TES3: Morrowind. Red Mountain is an active volcano, and the Dwemer built the ruins around the mountain.

4) **[Numidium](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Numidium)**, referred to as Walk-Brass by the Aldmer. This tower's stone was known as the Mantella, and was destroyed in TES2: Daggerfall. The Aldmer who built Numidium eventually became the Dwemer.

5) **[The Crystal Tower](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Crystal_Tower)**, referred to as Crystal-like-Law by the Aldmer. It is not yet known what this tower's stone is. Its builders later became the Altmer.

6) **[The Throat of the World](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Throat_of_the_World)**

(**I won't cover the events concerning this tower as they are spoilers for Skyrim's main quest!!**)

referred to as Snow Throat by the Aldmer. Its builders may have later become the Falmer, but that is only a guess on my part.

7) **Green-Sap**, nothing is known about this tower. It has been suggested that it is [Falinesti](http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Falinesti) and its creators likely became the Bosmer.

8) **Orichalc**, once again nothing is known about this tower. Its creators may be Orsimer or Khajiit.

What does any of this have to do with the TES games' storylines, you ask? Well, ever since TES 2: Daggerfall, a stone has been destroyed at the climax of every game! This could mean the barriers between Mundus and Oblivion are breaking down due to the protagonists of each TES game, and it also sets the stage for a main antagonist in the series, one who has been powerful enough to catalyze the events in Daggerfall, Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.

**TL;DR: There are 8 towers with corresponding stones which hold the barriers between Tamriel and Oblivion in tact. These stones are gradually being destroyed in every TES game.**

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. We are still getting quite a few new people, so I'll go ahead and reintroduce what this thread is:

The Weekly Community Threads are meant to be some of the only threads where much of the subreddit's rules do not apply and people are free to discuss whatever they like, not just lore-related subjects. In these threads are also announced most of the subreddit's announcements and the subreddit's activity is discussed, so if you wish to really be involved in the subreddit and its community, this is the best place to start.

**Weekly Summary**

Great week overall, lots of new scholars coming in and a generally very large amount of activity all around, nice to see multiple pages get filled with threads. In addition, the introduction of the [The Compilation of Apocrypha and Explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/compilation) looks to have inspired people to start kicking back into the apocrypha and explanation writing gear, as we got a very nice amount of it coming in this week, including Hollymarkie's *On the Species of Tamriel* Volume [I](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1ipeb1/on_the_species_of_tamriel_volume_i_the_origin_of/) &amp; [II](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1j612v/on_the_species_of_tamriel_volume_ii_the_aldmer_an/), waldorfwithoutwalnut's [The Dragon is Broken](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1izhy8/the_dragon_is_broken/) and [A Priest's Old Journal: The Burden of the Empire](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1j44q7/a_priests_old_journal_the_burden_of_the_empire/), and finally Mr_Flippers' [Talos the Conqueror, Vivec the Teacher and the Lessons](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1j39qw/talos_the_conqueror_vivec_the_teacher_and_the/) and [The Noisy Serpent Loves his War Speech](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1j3c5x/the_noisy_serpent_loves_his_war_speech/).

In addition to the threads themselves, we have gained 248 new scholars this week, so welcome to all the folks coming around.

**Announcements**

[Remember to shoot me a PM or a comment on the WCT if you want a thread added to the Compilation!](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/compilation)

Also, the next Community Thread will be posted Friday (US time) since the I will be in a plane for all of Saturday and Sunday.

**Scholar of the Week**

I saw some comments on his thread already that you guys were all expecting it anyway, so I won't do any sort of build-up to reveal. Mr_Flippers wins the SOTW award for the ~~6th~~ 5th time this week, surpassing even B-rad in terms of numbers of times winning and establishing an all time high score. Congrats, and thanks for the activity! *yeah, year 12, right*

That's pretty much it for this week, feel free once again to do as you like in the comments (just remember to still be nice)

Thank you very much for your activity, everyone, and I hope you have a great week!

Although there are only semi abstract statute representations of them through sculpture, their automatons, and one living specimen in one the older games we don't know. I've concluded that they probably looked like elvish Versions of bronze age civilizations such as Sumerians, Persians, Greeks and so on with a steampunk spin in architecture and technology. So my question arises; were they short like they're portrayed here in our universe? And why or what would cause them to live underground? My thoughts would be yes they were short, which would explain why they were so reclusive that they chose to live underground and for protection from the larger altmer and other above ground races and the need for protection  for why they bud the automatons while only using the larger men in their culture as a select few actual warriors. These are my thoughts and I'd like to hear your speculations teslore. So theorize and speculate away!

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. More specifically, welcome to all the new scholars, to what is most likely your first Weekly Community Threads. As an introduction to these threads, the Weekly Community Thread are the only not solely lore related threads in the subreddit. The normal posting rules do not apply, so one can discuss and comment whatever they want in the comments. In general the Weekly Community Threads are composed of a weekly summary, an election of a most active / best scholar of the week, and a comment section in which people generally relax and talk about their week. Welcome.

**Weekly Summary**

To start us off, I'd just want to acknowledge the fact that we have completely broken our record for most new scholars in a day, at least this year, with 231 new scholars gained in the day of May 30th. In total, we have gained 390 new scholars this week, so welcome to all the new people. 

Other than the traffic there is not too much to mention, no special threads to mention this week. Discussion in general was great, though, and you guys have done a great job of welcoming the new scholars. Well, in most threads anyway, the original thread with the diagram was quite chaotic, as was expected. As chaotic as it was, we've managed to calm down and greet the folks from /r/skyrim appropriately, so thank you. Remember, everyone, no matter how long you have been on /r/teslore and they haven't, no matter how much you know about the lore and they don't, no matter how involved in the community you may be, we are all here for the same purpose, and thus all should be treated the same. Please do keep on treating the /r/skyrim folks respectfully, we've done a swell enough job so far, let's not ruin it.

No further announcements this week.

**Scholar of the Week**

In continuation of the last few week's trend of re-electing great but already much elected scholars, this week's award goes for the third ever time to the great scholar *Lebiro*. In all honesty he was just as worthy of getting the award last week with the two great posts about Eplear, but this week Lebiro continued to be very active and has outmatched all other scholars as far as I can see.

---

That is pretty much it for this week. As always (and not always, for the new users), feel free to do as you like in the comments section. Also, go ahead and introduce yourself if you are new to the subreddit, we'd like to get to know all these new folks.

That is all, thank you very much for your work and activity, scholars, and I hope you have a great week!

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. Sorry for the late post, I only just got home after a long day out of town so I had to have you guys wait for the thread a bit.

**Weekly Summary**

This was quite the active week, both with the above-the-average number of threads and the whole deal celebrating us reaching the 10,000 subscriber mark. In addition to reaching the good ol' big round number, we have also gained 151 new scholars this week, so I'd like to go ahead and welcome all the new scholars to the subreddit, we do hope you have been enjoying our little (but growing!) subreddit so far.

As a reminder to all the new users around the time of the reaching of the 10K subscribers mark, I'd like to remind all the new and old users alike the importance of **reading the subreddit's sidebar and its links**. The rules, FAQ, New Scholar's Guide, and Voting Guidelines are all there to keep the subreddit's quality up and not let it devolve into the disorderly mess many other subreddits are, so we do appreciate the new users taking the time to read the sidebar.

Other than the new traffic, activity has also been quite good this week. We thank everyone for joining us in reading the [Pocket Guide to the Lore](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1dbptb/the_pocket_guide_to_the_lore/), a project Rhys and others have been working hard on for some time now, and appreciate people's criticisms and commentaries on the document. There aren't any threads too worthy of mentioning this week other than the PGE, though excitingly enough RottenDeadite has posted part 2 of his new series, [The 36 Lessons of Vivec, Sermons 13-24](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1dak5t/the_36_lessons_of_vivec_sermons_1324/).

**Scholar of the Week**

This week's Scholar of the Week award goes for the second time to the ol' Maormeri Luftahraan writer who has returned to us this week with overall the most activity out of any scholar this week. Thank you, *OPGreenback*, for your activity yet again. Just because you didn't post three 10,000 word stories in one week doesn't mean you can't be awarded.

---

That is pretty much all for this week. Once again welcome to all the new users, and as a heads up to the new scholars who don't know, Community Threads (and announcements) are the only threads in /r/teslore in which most rules you would find on the sidebar don't apply and discussion is not restricted only to lore. So feel free to post as you like.

Thank you everyone for your activity, and I hope you have a great week!

It never really struck me until I rolled a Bosmer how many Wood Elves there actually are in Skyrim. Most of the ""random"" hunters and hunter camps encountered in thew wilderness seem to be made up of or have at least one Bosmer as well.

The Nords never really seem to express any opinion of the Bosmer (whereas they'll gladly tell you how much they dislike the Altmer and distrust the Dunmer). You even have Faendal who lives in a pretty small town(although, I don't know how accurate it can be to use him as a reference for this considering he works at a Lumber mill :/) and no one even mentions it (with the exception of Sven).

Is there a Lore reason for this? I really don't want to write it off as Bethesda being lazy with the Bosmer as they usually are. Could it be because of cultural similarities? It just seems odd to me.

Along that same note, what would bring a Bosmer to Skyrim anyway? The Bosmer population in Skyrim is pretty small, but not so small as to toss it up to a few coincidental Bosmer just to give the game more racial diversity. I suppose they could be fleeing from the Dominion in Valenwood and wound up in Skyrim but what made them chose Skyrim over say settling somewhere in Cyrodil or High Rock? (As Hadvar says at the beginning during character creation ""Not many reasons for a wood elf to come alone to Skyrim.""

Got a pretty short weekly overview for you fine folks this week, less drama and frustration than last week. As you might notice this thread is posted not on the American sunday but rather a day earlier around American Saturday Night. This is not a temporary change, and will now be the regular scheduling for the Community Threads every week due to multiple scholars voicing their opinions as to the scheduling of the threads. Hopefully this will give the folks down in the other side of the earth a more appropriate time to join the threads (as said by Prince, no one wants to be cheery and social on Monday) as well as give more time for any other folks to converse at the thread over the weekend.

**Weekly Overview**

As with last week, overall activity and subscriber gain is pretty low, making the week quite relaxed for everyone to answer questions and post theories. This week we have welcomed 137 new scholars to the subreddit, lower than our averages around the time after the 1 year anniversary but certainly a good amount of fresh new scholars. Discussion and threads this week were mostly dominated with Q&amp;A threads though we did see some other activity with more lengthy threads such as [The Mabrigash] by AzraelDomonov, a very worthwhile read if I might add.

In other news, after some persuasion the very much missed [Elder Lore Podcast](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/) has returned to the subreddit featuring *8 new episodes* that seemingly most of us have missed. For those of you who have not listened to or do not know what the Podcast is, it is a fantastic lore podcast that goes into great detail about many important parts of the lore, all to the background of exorbitantly soothing Elder Scrolls music. I very much advise those who have not listened to Elder Lore to do so, even if it is for a few episodes (I personally suggest Seasons 1 + 2, but the rest are great, too).

Other than that there are not too many announcements from the mods. On a downside this week we did have to remove a very unhealthy amount of comments this week, which was saddening, but it did not seem to fit under any pattern that we could change, so the only thing we can do is to remind you all to reread the sidebar. That would be much appreciated.

**Scholar of the Week**

To take a bit of a break from entitling scholars for the second time or giving the title to a so-called regular power-poster, this week our Scholar of the Week, despite not being too famous around the subreddit as of yet or posting extremely lengthy threads, has been very active this week both in the subreddit and the communities that surround it. Our Scholar of the Week is scholar *evanj88*, for his continuous activity this week in discussions. Thank you, Evan, for your activity, this week. I hope to see more from you in the future.

That is all for this week, folks. Feel free as always to go wild and do as you please in the comments for this thread, no irrelevant comment or joke will be removed or downvoted here, as it goes with Community Thread. More specifically, feel free to introduce yourself if you are new to the subreddit or just have been lurking for all this while, or just tell me about how your week has been going no matter how long you've been in the subreddit.

Mysterious Akavir states 'The serpent-folk ate all the Men of Akavir"" and adds ""They enslave the goblins of the surrounding isles, who provide labor and fresh **blood**."" [Emphasis mine.]

The confusion of whether seems to come from the various remains and ghosts which have been encountered throughout Tamriel. 

I would like to posit that the men of Akavir were both eaten and assimilated. The Tsaesci took the Akaviri as a domesticated food source, much the same as men of Tamriel keep cows.

The men might be used as a status symbol amongst whatever passes for Tsaesci upper classes and nobility, or simply as an alternative to goblin blood. 

Akaviri would almost certainly prove to be stronger than goblins, as such they could be used for hard labor also.

I wanted to explore that aspect of them, and I noticed something; most obviously, the torture devices, traps, and their treatment of the Falmer, but also some of their architecture reflects it as well; the heads of the sculptures littering their ruins always show a face that is expressionless, , and the face on the Dwarven Helmets in Skyrim are always locked in a scowl.

Another thing I noticed was in Blackreach, you  can find a spot with stone Bleachers (chairs? Somewhere for an audience to sit)  overlooking a spinning deathtrap.

Could it be the Silvenar, *à la* Khajiiti Mane? A little unoriginal perhaps, although the Silvenar is terribly interesting. 

Could it be the Camorans? I think I remember another tower has a bloodline as a stone (but I can't think which) so maybe also a little unoriginal. Also, I feel like we would know if the Thalmor had exterminated the Camorans, which they surely would have if they were a stone. 

Maybe it could be the Green Pact? Y'ffre is known as the first earthbone, so it makes sense to me that he could be involved in a Tower. In that case, though, deactivating the tower, which has probably been done (since Falinesti has rooted) would mean breaking the Green Pact totally, which thematically is a little too like the Talos ban, and also would probably be known about.

I can't think of anything else it could be besides a physical object, and since there are not (to my knowledge) any famous Bosmeri artifacts associated with Falinesti, we would be at a total loss.

He'd thoomed the beast down, and victory seemed assured. As he readied for the final swing to cleave the beast's head off its scaly neck, he noticed that it braced itself, which cause him to pause. 

Holding his axe aloft, he asked the beast ""What's wrong? Scared to die, you great milk drinker?""

Of course, the dragon was feigning, and thoomed the warrior away from him, and struggled to stand. The Nord smacked himself on the head, for he'd forgotten to never taunt a downed dragon. However, his helm had flown off while he flew away from the dragon, and so he hit himself quite hard with a steel-gloved hand. Dazed, he focused on the dragon in the middle, and made ready.

They thoomed at the same time, and then all was dark.

""YOU STUPID LITTLE *JOOR*, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!"", the dragon roared. ""YOU'VE CAST US BOTH OUT!"" 

The man got up slowly, if indeed there still was up, for he and the dragon were Nowhere. ""Where in the oblivion are we?"" he asked, still dazed from his own stupidity.

The dragon snapped his great jaws, silently cursing the man. Finally, it spoke again ""You've thrown us out of time, you fool! Now I'm stuck here forever - with you!""

""Stuck...where?"" the man replied. His eyes could see nothing besides the dragon. All else was void.

""Out. Out of Time."" the dragon replied testily. ""We're out of time, and probably for good. Damn you you stupid little *joor*!""

This of course made no sense, for no man can be out of time, and especially no dragon. The man made to swing his axe at the dragon, to end what he knew must be some trickery, but found himself unable to move towards it. He tried again, to no avail.

""What the hell did you do to me?"" he growled, putting a thoom on his lips.

""I? What did *I* do you *you*?"", the dragon asked incredulously. ""Nothing. You went and put us out of time. And now I can't even have the pleasure of eating you. Not even a *Thu'um* could touch you now.""

""What are you saying?""

""Are you really that dense, you scrawny Nord? We're stuck here, together, forever, because you're an idiot.""

The Nord scratched his head, for none of what the dragon was saying made sense. He thoomed at the dragon, but cried out as it rang in his ears.

When at least he could hear again, he asked ""So, what do we do now? Wait to die?""

The dragon glared at him. ""'Wait'? You're serious?""

The Nord nodded his head, a decision he immediately regretted.

""I don't think you quite understand, which comes as no surprise. We are out of Time. There is no 'waiting' anymore.""

.

A few millennia went by in the Aurbis, and then the Nord asked the dragon ""So, we ought to think of something to stay amused. Can you tell stories, beast?""

The dragon blinked, then got a brilliant idea indeed. ""I'll teach you a song, and you must sing it while I speak, alright?""

The Nord agreed, for he enjoyed singing nearly as much as he enjoyed Shouting. The dragon taught him a song in the Old Tongue, and he set to singing it. The dragon settled back, and began its tale.

""Long ago, before the Great Break, I and some of my kin were hiding in the same mountains you scaled to fight me. They were bigger than I, and more powerful besides. We ruled those mountains before your kind rebelled, and afterwards, we held them as one of our places of... I suppose it is said, in your tongue, ""last refuge"". When the Great Break came, we all endured it as best we could. It was the worst, worse than any scale-itch you could... er... well, it was the worst feeling ever, to be sundered from our *Bormahu*. After what felt like ages, one of the bigger dragons said to me 'Ho ha ho, you speedy little runt, come here!' And I did.

'Yes, now you must go, and find the Menders beyond the Rim. They're being kept out, otherwise they would have fixed *Bormahu* by now. Go see what's taking them so long.' I leapt up and flew away to find the Menders.

I see the curiosity in in your ugly little face, so I'll tell you: the Menders are the helpers of *Bormahu*, Father. When his mind breaks, they come to him and nurse him back to sanity. In your tongue, I have heard them called 'jills', or something like that.

Anyway, I flew off to find them, passing through night and day. I flew over the dark waters, and the Princes on their islands parted their armies to let me pass, for they too were sick and tired of this stupid Break. I flew through the big hole in the waters, and out into the Magic Realm. The guardians let me pass, and they looked worried, so I hurried, and flew without rest onwards.

Eventually I reached the Rim, only to find my progress blocked by a dancing figure, larger than any I've ever seen. There were more of them all along the Rim, dancing and chanting in the same tongue you're singing in. I yelled at them to get out of the way, but they didn't respond, so I bit one.

He yelped and jumped and I was thrown out into the Void as his foot struck me.

So, I began to sing, calling for the Menders. I sang 

'Mothers, O Mothers, hear this lost sons' plea! Father is mad, and's not gotten better! I will show you the way to him!'

For what seemed like an eternity, I waited, and then they came, the Menders. Far more lovely and graceful than any of my kin you've seen, human, I guarantee you that. I showed them how to bite again, and they bit every dancer on the Rim. 

As we flew back through the Rim to find *Bormahu*, they sang in the tongue you sing in now, and in such fashion, healed his broken mind. And he said 'Ho ha ho, what has been happening?! How long have I lain mad?! I feel completely different!'

And his face was blurred, and we could not understand it.

And that's my story.""

The Nord stopped singing at the abrupt end. ""Wait, wait, hold on. How did you get back to those mountains?""

The dragon snorted. ""Is that important? No. Besides, I accomplished what I wanted.""

""And what was that?"" the Nord asked.

The dragon grinned a toothy grin. ""I got you to sing the Menders here. They haven't had a meal in ages, you see. They're quite ravenous.""

And the Nord looked, and the most terrifying shapes he'd ever seen were winging themselves out of the void. He screamed and thoomed until his ears bled, but it was no use, for the swiftest of the jills gobbled him up in one bite.

She spoke to the dragon floating in the void, saying ""Many thanks, Son of *Bormahu*, for this tasty morsel. Now wing your way home again. Make the story a bit shorter next time, for you're not good at telling them.""",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1359208922.0,,,True,t3_1797ch,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1797ch/the_bite_of_the_menders/,

Let me begin by saying congratulations to the subreddit and the scholars for reaching 7000 scholars. Not only have we gone from 6000 to 7000 in a single month, this week we have actually rocketed past the 7000 mark and are now fast approaching the 8000. This week scholar gain was probably at the highest since the original scholar iama that brought so many people here. Just in 12/30 we have gained 181 new scholars, and this entire week the subscriber gain number stands at **414**. Let me just say, Holy Shit, guys. Welcome, new scholars, I now know there are lots of you.

In times like these I do feel as though I need to reintroduce what these threads are for all the new people. The Weekly Community Thread is the only place on /r/teslore where all kinds of discussion are encouraged, whether lore related or not. The Thread is usually composed of me giving a weekly recap, as well as picking a Scholar of the Week and making announcements. In the comments people are free to discuss whatever they want, talk about the week, and introduce themselves if they are new.

----

Weekly Recap:

As I was saying this week has been very spectacularly active. I myself remember counting the number of threads per week a few weeks back and smiling at an amazing 24 threads. Well we just had 51 threads this week, so I guess I better change my standards.  I was wondering about all the activity and went to check if we got plugged in any way, and I found out there were quite a few threads in /r/skyrim lately in which people have linked /r/skyrim-ers to /r/teslore. So again, all I can say is welcome new people, welcome to the subreddit.

Particularly this week most activity has been in the simple question department, but we've also seen some other great threads including [""From the deserts of rust and wounds to Camoran's paradise"" a translation and interpretation of the Mysterium Xarxes Vol. II By Rileyman360](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15qn36/from_the_deserts_of_rust_and_wounds_to_camorans/), [Borgas the Fool-King By Dbcification](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15rc90/borgas_the_foolking/) and [Orcish Naming Customs By Myrrlyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15xkxu/orcish_naming_customs/). Thank you everybody for your participation and activity this week. If we continue having weeks like these we may reach the next subscriber milestone in two weeks and flood the subreddit with over a 100 threads in that long a time. I call it a Golden Age for the community, not sure about you.

Before heading on to announcing Scholar of the Week I'd just like to use the fact we have so many new people over to give some guidelines for all the new people.

---

**Surviving in /r/teslore 101**

There is not much to explain beyond what is already written, so I'll just link you to what you need to read.

If you are new, **please** read all of the things in the list below. If you don't you will not be able to be active in the community and most probably your comments will be removed. In order to be an active, well respected scholar, you should take a look at:

1. The Subreddit rules and guidelines in the sidebar right over there ---&gt;

2. [The New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/newscholarsguide)

3. [The FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/faq)

4. [Listen to at-least 10 episodes of the Elder Lore podcast if not more. Doing this is the most effective and basic way to start becoming a knowledgeable scholar. If you have a short attention span and are not willing to listen to all the episodes, you should at-least listen to all the ones in Season 2.](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/)

If you take the time to do these 4 things you will find yourself suddenly being a much better scholar and you will be able to understand all the complex mumbo-jumbo that most new scholars do not understand.

----

That is all I have for the weekly recap, time to announce the...

**Scholar of the Week**

Despite having to remove an unhealthy amount of comments from this user due to lore irrelevancy, I still have to give him/her the title. This week *Mr_Flippers* has been extremely active, to the point we actually got a request in mod mail to have the scholar win the position. Thank you, Mr_Flippers, for your great activity this week, hope we can see more continued activity from you in the future. 

---

That is all for this week, folks, do feel free to discuss whatever in the comments. Community Threads are purposefully free for everything.

Thank you for posting and joining guys, do keep on doing what you do, and have a great week.

1356850869.0,30,self.teslore,15nxi2,"A quick look into the Skaal of Solstheim and a theory on the ""All-Maker"" (Dragon Born spoilers)",Au-riel,32,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15nxi2/a_quick_look_into_the_skaal_of_solstheim_and_a/,"The Skaal of Solstheim are an offshoot of the Nordic race first introduced in Morrowind. In a book called ""the Traitor and the Guardian"" a Skaal belief is introduced that long ago Solstheim was a part of Skyrim. After a climatic battle between two dragon priest, Solstheim became disconnected from Skyrim and the ancient Nords located there are what we now know as the Skaal. Like their cousins, the Skaal posses all the racial attributes (such as partial ice resistance) associated to the Nords of Skyrim; however that is where the similaritys end. 

The first noticeable difference is that the Skaal are a peaceful, simpler folk than their cousins. Instead of hunting for sport and honor they hunt out of necessity. Their peaceful nature is evident in that during the events of the first Dragonborns attempted take over of Solstheim there is exactly ONE warrior in their entire village (it should be noted though that Thirsk Mead hall is a group of Skaal who left their peaceful lives to live in the ""Old Ways"").

Unlike the rest of the known Tamrielic religions, the Skaal's is unique because it is only one god, not a whole pantheon. They call their god the All-Maker. His influence is shown throughout Solstheim in the form of his totems. Each totem has it's own aspect (beast, water, air, sun, earth [tree]). These totems grant pilgrims unique  bonus and powers and are said to be as old as the Skaal themselves. 

So who, or what is the All-Maker? I belive the All-Maker isn't a god in the sense of a Daedric lord or Aedra. The All-Maker is a representation, a thought created out of necessity for an explanation. These people were uprooted from their culture and placed in a new environment, what little amount of people who survived the cataclysmic battle needed something to look to. They saw that the dragons could die and were therefor not gods, and they saw no evidence of the old Nordic pantheon to help them in their time of need. These people took a deep breath, looked around and saw the nature before them. They saw the forest surrounding them, they saw the wild beast, they saw the rivers and ocean shores, the frozen air around them, and the bright sun bringing light and energy to them. They saw these things and designed one being, one enigmatic creation god to focus their need for beliefs. Life for the Skaal is a constant struggle for survival, so they didn't need a plethora of gods who promised rewards for worship. They needed one being who creates the things they need throughout their daily lives. 

That's my own take on the enigmatic Skaal. Unfortunately, it's been stated in ""Children of the All-Maker"" that the Skaal are an increasingly small minority. Dragon Born may be the last time we will see the Skaal ever featured in TES universe.

I'm sorry, again, for the weird-ass scheduling, but I have officially decided I am moving Community Threads to Sunday. This is so my own real life activity won't get in the way of /r/teslore. Hope you are all okay with the new scheduling.

Anyway, without further due, let's summarize the week:

---

It has been a great week in /r/teslore. We have had a great many discussions and posts this week, including [The Prisoner, The Thief, The Tower, and the pursuit of CHIM by rexington](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12ptvj/the_prisoner_the_thief_the_tower_and_the_pursuit/), [Sermon Sixteen and the Scathing Bay by Anonymous_Mononymous](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12vc0l/sermon_sixteen_and_the_scathing_bay/), and finally [""The Origin of The Skyforge"" by Ornerycretin](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/12u170/thank_you_and_goodbye/), Ornery has left us to go deal with with more important real life concerns. I, and the rest of the community, would like to say goodbye to Ornery and thank him for his contribution to the subreddit.

But just as we lose some scholars, we gain many more. Specifically this week we have gained an amazing *172* new scholars. Welcome, new scholars, once again I'd like to remind you to read the sidebar and go through the links at the top.  

The community is always steadily growing, and soon we'll reach 6000 subscribers. It is a pretty amazing feat to collectively gain 6000 astoundingly intelligent and creative individuals in just a year, so the achievement has to be celebrated. Once again I'm reminding you guys that we plan on having a 1st anniversary celebration soon. We still need any suggestions or help possible, so *please* give any feedback you might have about what you think would be fun doing for the occasion.

Talking of anniversaries, 1 year ago today Skyrim came out, probably the most popular and widely acknowledged Elder Scrolls game. It is true some might have preferred the other games in the series, and it is also true that much of the games' fanbase may be a little dumb, but overall the game has greatly influenced lore and lore communities. In my personal experience with the game, I started out with no previous knowledge of the universe and a very straightforward approach to the game. My first character was, quite obviously, an Argonian, as I thought they looked cool. I started playing, my first impression of the game very hyped and excited for killing dragons, but as I progressed slowly through the main quest I found myself much more enthralled by learning about the world and communicating with it than slaying dragons or assassinating people. As with any chain reaction, one thing lead to another thing, and suddenly from asking /r/skyrim about Argonian Atlantis I became a moderator of a lore community and here I am now. So thank you, Bethesda, for the work you put into the game. Sadly it was my first tes game, yet it's what got me started.

I'd love if you guys shared your skyrim experiences. What were your first impressions of the game?

Anyway, going back to /r/teslore related things, it is time to reveal our:

**Scholar of the Week**

This week's scholar of the week has been extremely active and involved both this week and before. Honestly it is hard to keep track of the sheer amount of activity he's got in the subreddit due to both the fact that he posts pretty much everywhere, and he's got two /r/teslore-active accounts (not sure why he has two, honestly). So thank you, *b-rad-oleary*, for your continuous activity and enthusiasm in the subreddit. The Scholar of the Week's tavern is starting to fill up but there is definitely space for you to fit in.

---

That is pretty much all I have to say. This will (hopefully) not be my last post this week, Lilrhys and I are making something I think you guys would enjoy, and I am starting working on a big ol' post regarding dead Hist. 

So, as always:

* Introduce yourself if you are new
* Tell me about your week
* Give us feedback on anything.
* Give feedback about the anniversary celebration, and tell me about your skyrim experiences
* And, of course, just do whatever. I cannot stress how important it is that these threads just be used for anything miscellaneous or unrelated. You wanna post a picture of your TF2 character and his funny hat? Go ahead. This is the Community Thread, I ain't stopping you.

That is all. Keep on posting, and have a great week.

Quite possibly my favorite line from any in-game book, it describes the divine birth of Reman, the god-hero of the second empire, who was born between the union of King Hrol and the spirit of Saint Alessia, with Nirn acting as the surrogate.

Reman Cyrodiil, the Worldly God. born of Nirn on Sancre Tor. It has been established by MK that King Hrol was a ""Space God"" 

&gt; As far as the Anuad:

&gt; Nirn (Female/Land/Freedom catalyst for birth-death of enantiomorph)/ Anu-Padomay (enantiomorph with requisite betrayal)/ ?* (Witnessing Shield-thane who goes blind or is maimed and thus solidifies the wave-form; blind/maimed = = final decision)

&gt; *Seek and you shall find. I hid it.

&gt; Bonus:

&gt; King Hrol (seeker/Healer of Kingdom), ""from the lands beyond lost Twil"". Twil as Twilight. Grey Maybe. Aurbis. His knights numbered ""eighteen less one,"" the number of the Hurling Disk.

&gt; SPACE GODS BEGAT REMAN! NEWS AT ZERO-SUM, PACIFIC STANDARD GRADIENT!

Now whatever MK meant by that I don't know, but I don't think that Reman's lineage is what makes him a god, rather it is the enantiomorph that gave him his power.

Remember what Hrol says of Alessia?

&gt; sweet wife of Shor and of Auri-el 

and

&gt; who bore in her left hand the dragonfire of the aka-tosh and in her right hand the jewels of the covenant and on her breast a wound that spilt void onto her mangled feet

Alessia here is the wife of Auri-El and Shor, she is the unification of Anu and Padomay, this is further shown in the second paragraph, where she has symbols of both Aka (the Dragonfires) and Lorkhan (The wound on her chest) along with a symbol of their unity (the CHIM-EL ADABAL)

In my mind Hrol is playing the role of Lorkhan, the Padomaic, he is slain by Alessia 

&gt; but as you have run so many times from me so shall I run until you learn my pain, which renders you and all this land dead

Alesia was playing the role of Auri-El, the Anuic

At the end Hrol is dead, Alessia is gone, and Reman has been born from Nirn, which in and of itself was born from the interactions of Lorkhan and Auri-El.

Talos reenacted Convention to attain his divinity, Reman reenacted the birth of Mundus. Reman, just like Nirn, represents both sides of the Enantiomorph. This is why his title is ""The Worldly God""",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1351214513.0,,Mythic,True,t3_122wei,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/122wei/on_remans_divinity/,

If, in ""actual"" TES history, the dragonborn were to ally with a Daedric Prince, could he (by virtue of his own birthright combined with the assistance of a powerful Daedric Prince, not to mention all those dragon souls he's been stealing) open a gate to one or more Oblivion Planes?

Welcome to the Weekly Community Thread! Today we have a rather special thread, but I will talk about that later. It's been a grand week, rather short on posts in general but plentiful in good questions and interesting topics.

---

It has been a very interesting week. The moderators have been doing some talking about how to better improve the subreddit, and furthermore discussing it's current qualities.

In the subreddit itself the week has gone great. We have gained a total of *106* new scholars, which I hope everyone will welcome warmly. If you are a new scholar please make sure you have read the [New Scholar's Guide to the subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/111sx2/the_new_scholars_guide_to_rteslore/) and the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/vs8w4/the_official_faq/). Also please introduce yourselves in the comments in the community thread, I'd like to get to know you guys and gals. 

Going back to the week, we've had a variety of good question threads as well as some interesting reads and a great new episode of the [Elder Lore Podcast](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/episodes/season-three/08-kings-and-rebels/). Some great threads this week were [Ornerycretin's almost-done Skyforge Song](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1192z1/almost_done_skyforge_song/), [dbcification's heavily upvoted explanation of the mysterious case of Rorikstead](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1175nc/the_mysterious_case_of_rorikstead_conjectureheavy/), and my personal favorite of the week, Ishullanu's [The Handless Mage](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/114j54/the_handless_mage/).

Great work posting, scholars, do continue posting and commenting!

Sadly this week we do not have a Scholar of the Week due to the fact that it will draw too much attention to a single scholar, a thing that could distort and derail the election.

Talking of the *election*:

**Electing a new Moderator, brought to you by Prince-of-Plots**

---

With our community growing as steadily as it is, we've decided that it'd be in our best interests to recruit another moderator (yeah, another one) to aid us in the decisions we make for the subreddit and in our other moderating duties. Basically, you'll need to be willing and able to:

* Review thread content for quality and appropriateness and take action if necessary

* Browse thread comments to remove spam and irrelevant content

* Be active enough to respond to mod mail and discussion soon enough that it isn't an inconvenience (this doesn't go without saying, apparently)

You only really need to be online every two days or so to be active enough, though daily is ideal. Your typical moderating duties shouldn't take more than a few minutes from your day.

If you feel that you fulfill these requirements and would like to take the position, let us know in this thread. Obviously, if you're an active member in /r/teslore then you'll be more likely to be chosen - not out of favoritism, mind you, but it means we have a better feel for what you're about and we'll be more sure that you're prepared to devote some effort to /r/teslore. Everyone who raises their hand will be reviewed, of course, we won't simply dismiss people.

**Do not nominate other people. If you see someone that wants to be a moderator and you agree that they should be, offer your support for them in a reply to their post.**

Please share your opinion on this topic. It is very important to get the opinion of as many scholars as possible so we could satisfy as many scholars as possible.

---

Anyway (Xeno again, here), as with the outro I always give, thank you everybody for posting and commenting. This may be a special community thread but the normal guidelines don't change much. *Please* do tell me about your week if you wish, and introduce yourself if you are either new or not particularly new and have just been lurking this entire time. 

Also, very important, remember to comment your opinion on who should be a new moderator! 

If you do not get the position have the respect and sportsmanship not to complain nor act jealously at the scholar who did get the position. This is an important event but not quite important that you should be pissed if it does not turn out the way you wanted it too.

Other than that keep on posting, and have a great weekend

Hello everyone! 

Welcome to the **Weekly Community Thread for 9/14 to 9/21!**

-

We have had quite the week. Subscriber gain has cooled down since last week's astounding *169* new subscribers, yet we still gained a good 88 subscribers this week, putting us at 5285 scholars strong. Welcome, new scholars, it would be great if you new scholars introduced yourself in the comments.

Aside from traffic stats, we have actually had a magnificent week- with some very great threads. The [Imperial Report on the Origin of the Sload](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/106hb1/imperial_report_on_the_origin_of_the_sload/) by b-rad-oleary, a [Meditation on Creation and Divinity](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1075mu/a_meditation_on_creation_and_divinity/) by RottenDeaditte, and of course Lilrhys's [Convention 2.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/101dwz/convention_20/) were all awesome threads which were both extremely interesting to read and provoked great discussion. 

Talking of good posts, we also had an event equivalent in importance and shock-capacity to the resurrection of Jesus, when the [ElderLore](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/) podcast [came back from the dead](http://elderlore.wordpress.com/episodes/season-three/07-the-towers/)  to shock and amaze the people of /r/teslore.

Thanks to everyone for posting!

Also, on the topic of posting, I'd like to remind all new scholars to *please* **Read the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/vs8w4/the_official_faq/)** before posting. I cannot stress this enough.

Back to good posts, though, it is time to reveal who is our

**Scholar of the Week**

Unlike last week's space-race style competition between two choices, we have actually had a great amount of good scholars who I thought of giving the award to. There is one scholar, though, who I thought has not produced any *amazing* comments but has over-all provided a great load of quality comments this week. Our week's Scholar of the Week is:

[Pedanterrific!](http://www.reddit.com/user/pedanterrific)

Thank you, terrific, for generally providing some great comments and helping move discussion forward this last week. Go ahead and join Wuuthrad in that fine ol' tavern and celebrate with a horn of ale and a sweetroll. 

---

Anyways, thanks to everyone for posting and commenting, once again I'll be delighted to know about the highs and downs of your week. I've had a pretty good week myself, got some good exercise and got my brain filled to saturation with ""Return to Ravinca"" hype.

So go ahead and tell me about your week in the comments. New scholars please introduce yourselves, and everybody please go ahead and give me any feedback you might have about anything.

Hope everyone has a great weekend!

---

Kagrenac, Chief Tonal Architect of the Dwemer, crafted Sunder and Keening and the wraithgaurd in order to tap into the Heart of Lorkhan. Using the tools he brought forth the Tone of Padomay, which he divided into fifteen tones.

Padomay and Anu begat Akatosh and Lorkhan, Lorkhan begat Nirn and Akatosh begat Dragons.

----

Generationally, the Tone of Padomay could be considered stronger than any language Lorkhan or Akatosh could produce.

kagrenac was able to take a single Tone from Padomay and divided it into 15 sub-tones.  Perhaps putting it on the same linguistic plane as that of Lorkhan and Akatosh.  The number 15 appears again in other bits of lore.

(It stands to reason that Lorkhan and Akatosh ""spoke"" the same language, or were on a relational level that they understood each other.)

Alduin, being Akatosh's first born, would be on some level the next line in the family.  The language of Alduin is the Dragon Shout. But the Fifteen Tones of Kagrenac are the language of Lorkhan and Akatosh.

Therefore, Kagrenac's Tones are more powerful than Dragon Shouts.

---

Further assumptions ---

* Padomay and Any only have two words/tones. ""is"" and ""is not"" (yes that's three but conceptually it's two)

* Lorkhan and Akatosh have fifteen tones.  In fact that makes sense considering that each one belongs to a Daedric Prince.

* Alduin and his fellow Dragons have a combined total of 23 ""pure"" shouts.  Although as a language it is obviously more complex.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Psijic,True,t3_107ohq,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/107ohq/i_believe_kagrenacs_fifteen_tones_are_more/,

There is an uncountable amount of them, and judging by each interaction we have with them, they can all do different things.

In Skyrim and Dawnguard, we see three more Elder Scrolls. All three of them, together, foretell of one prophecy, and one scroll let's you go back in time to witness the use of Dragonrend, and the use of the scroll to banish Alduin.

What I don't understand is how Corvus Umbranox could break the curse if everything in the past is fixed within the scroll, and how the Dragonborn could merely step into magical pillars of light and read them with ease and without the penalty Moth Priests face.

1) I'm curious about dragon physiology and biologic function, but since there's no lore on that at all, to my knowledge, I'll just assume they have normal dragon things. Like eggs. Discuss this if you want, but it's a minor point for me.

2) Dragons call themselves sons of Akatosh. Do they actually have Akatosh's ""blood"" in them? Are they essentially the same souls as men and mer but bound to a representative of the Time God and magnified by His aspect in their bodies? Or other.

3) How does the Thu'um work? Yes, I've heard the in-game descriptions. Yell things really loudly and if you're special, mythopeism transforms words into reality. I'm not wildly satisfied with that.

4) We've seen that dragons, especially Alduin, have close relationships with time and can defy it. I believe his Shout to reawaken Salohknir is Time Flesh Undo, or along those lines, and it works. Also Alduin was defeated once using Time, which is both his strength and weakness. Expound?

5) I'm sure I'm missing lots of dragon-lore and don't know enough to ask to learn what I don't know. If you could, fill in whatever you know or speculate on the topic.

We know that when the moons reappear, the Thalmor claim it as their doing which makes the Khajiiti people bend the knee to the Almderi Dominion.

My question is this; the Khajiit race depends heavily on moon phases to designate the birth/morphology of their progeny. When both moons cannot be seen it means that Khajiit birth 'Suthay' offspring, these resemble the Morrowind breed of Khajiit.

But it makes me wonder, because they know the moons are in the heavens it is still a moon phase thus their offspring are born Suthay.

But in this instance of 2 years it is reported that the moons physically vanished from the night sky. This isn't a natural moon phase so what would happen? Would they have birthed a new breed of Khajiit in this time? What would have changed? Are there any reports that signify any new types of Khajiit?

A personal theory of mine regarding the disappearance of the moons is that the same form of magic used to make Artaeum vanish for hundreds of years was used in some way this time round. Purely conjecture though. 

But let's discuss this, I find it all a fascinating time in Tamrielic history.

My confusion stems from this last group.  I'm fairly certain that the eight divines fall into this category--the frequent question about the divines' lack of direct impact is usually answered explaining just this.  How, then, did Convention take place?  The main players were very much ""alive"" on Nirn for it.  Moreover, how is Trinimac around in the Merethic era?

I can see it happening one of three ways. I will use the start of the 4th era as an example.


* 1. Mehrunes Dagon is banished, the Oblivion Crisis is stopped Tamriel is saved. The day this happens a new era is declared the 3rd era ends and the 4th begins.

To me this seems unlikely, with all the chaos, the time to communicate this and so rashly making this major decision. 

* 2.  Mehrunes Dagon is banished, the Oblivion Crisis is stopped Tamriel is saved. Weeks, months, years possibly pass. The events that passed are reflected on and it is decided that this event changed Tamriel so drastically that a new era should be begin in wake these events. A message is sent out saying that in wake of these events one month from now the 4th era shall begin 4E 0. 

This seems the most logical but does not hold true to the lore when it comes to written dates etc. Unless over the years the dates were miscommunicated and the date of the end of the oblivion crisis is not truly known.

* 3. Similar to number 2 the events pass and the decision is made after things have calmed down. But the decision is made to back date the start of the new era to ending of the oblivion crisis and a message is send out stating, The 4th era has begun and that (specific 3rd era date) will mark the beginning of this new era as 4E 0. [Please note this and amend any official records to match this new date]. 

This is my personal favourite and I would think it to be the most likely.

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. While the Moderator Elections that have started yesterday and may be considered a Community Thread of their own, this time around we are separating elections from Community Thread firstly to highlight the elections and secondly to cause less confusion.

We're going to switch it up today and do announcements first, before the Weekly Summary, as the announcements are quite important (so read them)

**Announcements**

The Moderator Elections are under way and we now have three viable candidates (and Gerka) competing. We have decided to close the nomination process and go with these three candidates, and are now beginning the official voting process.

Go vote! do it! 

**Weekly Summary**

Mighty fine week if I may say so myself. We got pretty stocked on activity both in the Q&amp;A department and others, sadly we didn't get as stocked in the ""Reading"" department as we did last week (just joking, of course). We are steadily gaining new scholars, with 172 new scholars this week. It looks to me like these new scholars are being welcomed pretty well, so good job guys. I am also pleased to announce us moderators weren't forced to be too trigger happy with our remove and ban tools when compared to last few series of weeks, so good job on that account, too.

No big threads to specifically mention or anything too exciting part for the Moderator Elections, but I can say I'm pleased. Keep at it, folks.

**Scholar of the Week**

This week's SOTW goes to a new scholar in our ranks. Normally the SOTW award goes to those who show their activity and mastery of the lore, yet seldom do I give the award based on the attitude regarding the lore. Dovahkiin42 may be a bit inexperienced in the ways of ES lore scholarship, but is certainly one of the most active and enthusiastic new scholars I've seen enter the subreddit. Good job this week, Dovahkiin42, trying to pull all that content so quickly and pulling through all the criticism, hopefully your career on the subreddit will evolve well in the future.

---

Right, that's pretty much it for this week, scholars. Again, if you hadn't read the announcement section, READ IT. NAO. Also feel free to do as you like in the comments of this post, there are many exceptions to our normal rules in the community thread and hopefully downvotes are a lot less common. You should also feel free to introduce yourself if you are new or have just been lurking all this time.

That is all, thank you everyone for your activity, and have a great week!

Magister, I submit to you the following as a preamble to my thesis. I invite your criticism and comments and shall endeavor to take them into consideration when producing my final work.

As we all know, in the last year of the 2nd Era the great Dunmer Wizard/God Sotha Sil made a pact with the Daedra Lords that henceforth, the Lords could only be summoned through very select intermediaries. Further details of the pact remain unknown. 

In the wake of the Oblivion Crisis at the end of the 3rd Era, the barriers that kept Oblivion separate from Mundas were broken down and the forces of Prince Mehrunes Dagon poured into Tamriel in an invasion, culminating in the appearance of the Prince himself in the Imperial City.

Such an event seems to indicate that after the breakdown of the Barriers, Sotha Sil's pact seemed to no longer be in effect. This begs the question, what kept the other Lords at bay? We have no record of any other Princes taking the opportunity to intrude into Mundas, their lack of motivation not withstanding (although we did hear news of certain agents of Meridia sighted in that same time period). 

At the same time, it was reported that the individual now known as the Champion of Cyrodiil was making pilgrimages to all known sites of Daedra worship in Cyrodiil and performing favors for the Lords. 

It is the theory of this humble mage-hopeful, that the Champion was reaffirming Sotha Sil's pact with the Daedra Lords. The Champion seems to have bartered with the Lords, one at a time and gained their favor through certain acts. Perhaps in response, the Lords agreed to hold to the pact they made to Sotha Sil, even though there was nothing physically preventing them from doing so. If my theory is true, we may owe a lot more to the Champion than previously thought. 

It has now been reported that the individual regarded as the Dragonborn has also been dealing in Daedric affairs. I have no theory for this however and submit myself to your esteemed opinion",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Tribunal,True,t3_1h6jn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1h6jn7/cocs_pact_with_the_daedra_lords/,

even the un-loved, un-bid, and un-come
have my ruddy [name] upon  their lips”
- Bellite Caramel Sutta, 69.1.3



Chapter 1: Divination of In-Geniused Gametopraxis Facilities:
 
When scouting for potential facilities, one must consider the current cycle of the Hist, as well as the perennial distribution of euhist, which plays a major role in the production of pistics. Ritual gametopraxis is a long, winding path along which lies inspiration, evangelism, interlocution and eventual illumination is a deeply personal catabasic dream journey throughout the Argonian Ummah - both veiled within metaphor and exemplified in living aedifice.

The first sign you have reached your destination will be the underspirit murmurs of the Hist patricians in your apotrope,  signalling an approbed genius location for gametopraxis. In this state all members of the opposite phyle (or the same; occasionally both) appear more auspicious, and you may notice your own unexpected inspiration. It can be said that inspiration in Argonians is similar to night terrors and drunken delusion. Many do not survive the journey.

The bravest of the Saxheel have attempted to interlocute sub-marine-asana, although this can sometimes lead to disaster. The vestal squam surrounding the yonic apotrope  are incredibly sharp and can easily and quite messily discommune her counter-point should the currents take him in the wrong direction.  To the uninitiated, yonic Argonians may appear tacit during the process, leading to a number of misapprehensions in other creeds - yet as can be seen in what follows, this superficiality is, by essence, paradox in paraprax.
 
 
Chapter 2: Argonian  Phyle-Ontology:

Argonian Tribal Law recognizes 11 distinct phyles. 3 tepoztopilliite, 4  yonic, 2 epicene, and 2 intermezzo.  

Mantis tepoztopillis are dedicated proselytisers. Acro-bathyc, lithe, and naturally well-spoken, they are expected to dedicate themselves to the art of evangelization, devoting  their primary, secondary, and tertiary apotropes, outside of ritual combats, utterly to prosecuting the Hist faith into the unillumined. Past their prime, it is natural and indeed expected that they wield their massive charisma towards  political, ecclesiate, and academic careers.

Phylake tepoztopillis are warriors. Possessed of robust musculature and thrice-layered scales, they are expected to give their lives to protect the tribe, allowed to gametoprax only by a strict economy of vanquished foes: A phylake hoping to interlocute apotropy must present his tribal meterix  thirteen cleaned and bleached apistic's teeth for an evening’s commune.

Candle tepoztopillis  act as reserves. Diminutive in stature and intellect, their unassuming arsenal is preserved, in case of crisis, with a sheath of protective smf, or ‘godwax.’

Chapter 4: Establishment of Counter-Point:

Argonians inspire potential counter-points with the use of their vibrant iconology. The inspiration to apistics may not be obvious at first; this is because the auspicious derms vesting inspirational yonics are not visible to anyone not granted the b’r’ghayglys or “ true sight""  by way of euhist communion.
 
 Root-faithful keep their phylacteries obscured inside their forms so it can be hard to know if one is a tepoztopilliite, yonic or of the other phyle; this can lead to heretical asanas between unobservant counter-points. However, most Argonians do not discriminate based on phyle, nor do the Hist expressly interdict., as divination of the opposing phyle is required only when proselytism is the goal.
 
For most tepoztopilli Argonians, inspiration causes the fulfillment  and ascension of a pair of quivering peduncular apotropes resembling nothing so much a many-petaled flower on a short, squat stalk. Aopotropes can come in many colors, most commonly bright, fierce shades that draw the eye and, perhaps, inspire a counter-point.
 
 On the contrary, yonic Argonians often have delicately formed, almost translucent apotropes well-obscured by thick squams and similar in form and function to apistics. What appear to be tabernacles on yonics are, in fact, quiescent orbophylacteries, and are not generally viewed as inspirational within the Argonian faith (outside of a few unnoteworthy schisms).

Specifics of the Argonian gametopraxis ritual are often influenced by the customs local to the Argonian's habitation which can lead to some drastic variations.  For example: in the Cyrodiilic systems, formalized dancing in large congregations is often a precursor to more cloistered practice.  However, since dancing within certain sect forms a necessary part of their interlocutionary rites, Argonians from such orders may prefer to eschew this form of communication  in the interest of avoiding unbecoming inspirational hysterics.  As a result, it is often customary for Argonians to make a pilgrimage back to The Ummah  before they find a counter-point.
 
Chapter 5: Techne for Inspiration:

The process of interlocution  can vary a great deal depending on the distance from The Ummah, the hierarchy of the communicants, and the amount of euhist all practitioners have imbibed. Interlocution with only oneself is wholly proscribed and approbed and at times indoctrination occurs ex corpore, which is much less dangerous for the tepoztopilli. Further from The Ummah, interlocution resembles apistic ritual, with some key differences.

For one, yonics must often subdue incalcitrant tepoztopilli. A common method is to bite the neck from behind. The ensuing pain has effects that are quite similar to inspiration. If this is not sufficient, more extreme methods have been used. Groups of yonics have been known to tie tepoztopillis to the Hist trees and attach juvescent  deacon-fish to their pectoral inspirators . This rarely fails to induce inspiration.

When the apotropeia of the tepoztopilli is fully revealed, he must begin to inspire his counter-point. Should he decide to initiate parousia before the yonic's  distaff is fully ascended, thus exposing her apotrope, the surrounding vestments will not have receded past the point of danger. Much like underwater interlocution, this can be quite dangerous. A discommuned Argonian is quickly disposed of by way of special judgement and secret justice, making successful interlocution a life or death endeavor.

When evangelization  is complete, the yonic Argonian will often internally store excess sutta for a later date. Once she has produced more orbs, a second evangelization can occur in immaculate fashion.
 
All rites of interlocution are observed by and approbated by the arboreal will of the Hist, for without them there would be no such action. The euhist the Argonians must imbibe beforehand allows the Hist access to their cloister. Both counter-points must then perform to the Hist’s exacting standards. Should they measure up, they are blessed with true inspiration, even enlightenment.
 
Chapter 6: Maltransmission of Root Heresy:

The Root Heresy itself is an enigma thought to be stellar myth outside of  The Ummah, much as the Hist themselves, yet, when not kept in check its reality cannot be denied. As was seen be seen in the bioclasm of the original Hist homeworld of [untranslatable], which after the outbreak of 1E 668 was quarantined by order of the Dendrite Assembly outside the bounds of the known rhizomes,  accessible now only through the samadhi organelle of the raining [sic] Tulkutree.
 
In aedifice, the Root Heresy takes a likeness to a small worm, usually right beneath the upper vestments of the hostform. How this creature spawns or just otherwise comes to reside on the host to begin with is unknown, though popular doxa holds that they are the result of apistic devilry. While so near the surface, the Root Heresy may be easily dispatched by quick exorcism, yet once it has reached the root echelon it may enter chrysalic cloister and hatch into a heresiarch, a dual-headed parasite capable of infecting the entire rhizome with twice-spoken dogmas. At this point the Root Heresy is able by impunity to reach critical blaspheme and burst forth  n violent sect schism to threaten the whole of the Ecumene and greater still.

This bale entity - which is often compared to the Sat-k.l of the Red-Guardsman Guilds or the Old-One of the Atmor system -  is the eschaton phase of Root Heresy, slowly absorbing what remains of any faithful entities into its vascules until the cosmos itself is nothing more than the bloated form of a worm born from the illicitation of unapprobed interlocution.

Avoidance of this eschatological disease can be achieved only through proper rites, the key element of which is the application of Sload chrism at regular intervals throughout the course of daily activities.
 
Chapter 7: Apotropaeic Guerilla Warfare:

During the Lunar bacchanal of Ssang-Wei, the mantis-tepoztopillis, phylake-tepoztopillis, and candle-tepoztopillis of all tribes gather at the Hippo Campus for deep-Hist war games to garner and test their faith. Zealots will slather their apotropes with copious amounts of euhist, ensuring thunderous inspiration, thereafter retiring to their battlenests for an excitable fortnight of nocturnal rear-sorties and pullout feints.

At the end of the contest, the victorious braves, or Pssxhtchrs, console the inferior tribes by throat-singing the virtues of their apotropes.

Yonics also participate in duels, known as Fshrknxi, by way of deep-cloister sacred dances utilizing the more prodigious vestal squam. The victrix is named when all other yonics are felled into stupor from hemaduct endommage.
 
Chapter 8: Xeno-Evangelism:

The popular notion amongst the apistics of the Ecumene that Argonian xeno-evangelism is a simple matter, with nothing more to be said of such than the neophyte taking on the characteristics of the godmother, is, this author can confirm, resolutely, miserably false.
 
 In perfect, regrettable truth, exocommunion, deprived of the grace of the euhist by necessity (for the Hist do not approve their murmurs taken abroad) illumines a quantum foam of outcomes-like-bubbles, at once here, now flitting there, and back again on the whim of the breeze: the novitiate maybe  fully root-faithed, fully apistic, or a chimerical mass of  hurdygurdy inbetween horror.  The communicants could become entangled in patristic paradox, illuminating their own conceptions, or even negating them in favor of Boiche-type formal apostasy. In some rare circumstances that defy letters, eschaton would be all but forgone.
 
For this reason the practice is carried out with - even amongst the most overzealous - with the utmost caution and heavy investment in contracommunicative wards.

However, Argonians do frequently commune with the Tsaesci as the two faiths are, ironically enough for brothers of squamous creeds , incapable of mutual illumination.
 
If, for example, a Tsaesci is within The Ummah on ambassadorial business, after matters are concluded the diplomats would forgo such apistic barbarities as hand-shaking in favor of a more cloistered farewell. The victors and victrices of the most recent Ssang-Wei are summoned to meet the ambassador, who then selects interlocuters according to the demands of his native gospel.
 
If the chosen is yonic, it is customary for the Tsaesci to bite deep into the Argonian’s phylacteries, in order to display that he has no interest in illumination, which causes the sacred ichor to leak out.
 
However, if the Argonian is tepoztopilliish, the practice is completely ignored, and the couple move onto the next steps of the ritual. Both parties first stand upright, the Argonian remaining completely still whilst the Tsaesci wraps his or her extremely flexible lower vestments around the Argonian. From there on the practice is incredibly similar to ordinary interlocution, except that the Argonian takes a completely tacit role whilst the Tsaesci controls the syllogistic interface of the communication. After the ritual the Tsaesci is offered a cup of Argonian sacred ichor - theatrical symbolysis of living sacrifice,  alluding to some guignol event in unwritten parahistories unknown  to softer-skinned apistics, or so this one is told.


Final Word:
 
It is this author's gilded well-intention that this guide will  serve to dispel the many common misapprehensions among the softer dermed creeds of the Ecumene . Histtheology can be quite fascinating, and the information contained herein should, it has been supremely hoped,  lead to improved understanding and respect between all observable faiths.

Did Martin know that would happen? If I remember correctly, Martin didn't plan to shatter the Amulet of Kings. If Martin is the lone heir, he should have impregnated a few women who understood the situation because Tamriel needs a Septim (or at least arrange for some  magic pregnancy!). If Martin had died willy-nilly (e.g. due to Mythic Dawn assassins), Cyrodiil would have been screwed. It seems like Martin took a big gamble. 

EDIT: Think about this. The crisis was not a nice time and there was a high chance of death. What would have happened if Martin had died during the crisis? No Septim heir to light the Dragonfires.

Can they change history? If so, what about the heavy duty stuff, like Dragon Breaks or Dawn Era?

To begin, my question is somewhat inspired by http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1dg5sy/xpost_from_rskyrim_really_interesting_thing_i/

But I feel it is a different consideration.

Would it be considered a crime to move from one province to another without a ""visa"" (for lack of a better word)? When Ralof says early on:

 ""Hey! You! You're finally awake. You were trying to cross the border, right? Walked right into that imperial ambush same as us and that thief over there.""

Is the crossing of a border inherently a crime, or was the PC arrested only for existing at the ""wrong place/wrong time""?

I know, for various reasons, that the crime(s) of the prisoner-protagonist are not made explicit in the series: however, would a run-of-the-mill citizen/merchant/mercenary be able to travel from Cyrodiil to Skyrim without official permission? If closed-border/controlled-border policies _were_ in place, were they limited to provinces experiencing martial law (re: obvious Civil War), or were they constant?

Lastly- is border policy declared centrally by the Emperor/bureaucracy, by province, or as a compromise made between imperial and provincial governments?

It's time for yet another late late Community Thread. 

This thread is probably going to be a bit short, which I am sorry about. Gonna do my best to sum up everything even though it is quite late, so why not just jump right in to the weekly overview.

**Weekly Overview**

This week was quite interesting. Weirdly it did not follow with the rest of the latest weeks, with a rather small amount of overall activity yet a high rise in quality content. While we still do see lots of question threads, we did have a pretty large amount of high quality threads such as [""Khajiit did not steal anything!"". A look into why Khajiit theft is misunderstood By Mr_Flippers](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1a0sao/khajiit_did_not_steal_anything_a_look_into_why/), [An Inspired Account of the Dawn Era v.1 – by Psyijic Empocarius – 4E 97 By Empocariam](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1a2an2/an_inspired_account_of_the_dawn_era_v1_by_psyijic/), [On the marriage practices of Morrowind, and some notes on the institution of slavery in Morrowind by FrankManic](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19smmy/on_the_marriage_practices_of_morrowind_and_some/) and [Burial Customs of the 10 Races, Part 1 by Anhrl](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/19nyhj/burial_customs_of_the_10_races_part_1/). Just as weirdly it seems the rate of newcomers is starting to slow down, with 197 new subscribers this week. Nevertheless there are many newcomers, so I'd like to just formally welcome all you new scholars again to our not-so-humble little subreddit. Hopefully you all did a good job looking through the sidebar and its links, you probably all know by now how important that is to us mods.

Talking of us mods, there is some intensive moderator discussion going on and we are planning a bit of an update that should at least slightly increase the quality of our subreddit. Hopefully the update wouldn't change too many things to have any negative effect and you will all like the improvements it makes.

**Scholar of the Week**

It does seem we are continuing with the trend of electing Scholars of the Week for their second term, and this week is no different. This week, *Mr_Flippers* has had a very impressive amount of activity in the subreddit both in his own posts and in others. Thank you very much, Flippers, once again for your continued activity, as well as for helping me out in the effort to through conjecture and story telling make the two beast races stand put as the coolest of all races on Tamriel.

---

That's it for this week, folks, sorry again for the rushed thread. Thank you all very much for your activity this week, guys, and welcome again to all the new scholars. Do continue posting and commenting, and have a great week!

**KAH JOOR RIIK**

Tidings and hale health, Great Wyrm; 'Tis I your trothen yokeman, Shaldr Glim-Tree, Headcleverman of the Winter's Hold Forthrow.

I am sending word today of our team's headway; but first, great heed you is owed, m'Lud, for the doomworthing siger over the Southrons at Fall Kreath. I and my team passed the honey-horn trind the workhall when the goody news reached us. The Sjardalls ought to know better than to make war on their own warlearners, and by your might they must be surely learned to smarting.

Unhappily however, I am truly the saddest man under sky to say that the most clever of clevermen in all Skyrim have not had samewise sigspeed. The bynamed 'Horker's Teeth' clevercraftling is a stubborn deer, her deep, brainaddling ghostwonder shaking off all offwilled weirds.

But thware me to unriddle, for our delves have not backcome from the swarthollow of slackwitness showing naught, not when our pack-saddlewits are flowing laden of goldhordish Lundworld kenship.

Now to startings: As Your Wyrmshipfulness must well ken, all stuffs erdlandish to Mhungard are withput, clean or mingled at unsame forsharings, of the eight aldstuffs - Heaven, Fire, Loft, Water, Flesh, Wood, Earth, and Blome. Time was, all cleverdom long thought the aldstuffs were the first, foremost, unrendsome wellheads of worldmaking.

Yet mine delvings at the Aldstuff Onquickeningstead- so givefully us afforded by your Lordship's open hand - wherewith edgesaid, forecarvesome betakings of thriceboned Unedlithing Might untoward bulks of unsame stuffs - swords, yokes, ducks, bits of bark, and so to forever, has yielded up through forsoothily many and mighty sunderings one such suchness: the aldstuffs are deeply withput of stringlike Navelrigging taut like gleecraftish catguts, so that they ever quiver with one-only gleestaffs, mingling together where the rigs makes pitchclasping, and sundering utter-out at pitchclashing. The strands fray down then to tine specks I deem Navelgrits.

Delving deeper inwise with rearding claps of my Might spoke thinner than a fly's pintlebone, I found themselves not wholebeings either, rather fraying to splitter strands even still and hollow utmostly within. Dead middlewise the inhold is the Unsmite, an unsmotesome (though unreckonsome times I have fand) kernel of whetherfraught specks, Graymotes, about which a clove of douthsome fraught specks, Drightenmotes, ever hound in trindleringwise workpath a clove of nithingly fraught Elfinmotes.

Not-withstanding the seemly evenweight of fraughtships, as far as my inwits can unriddle, this tiny-tine season-unending is mightily slothsome, slower than the drive of icklehead, though mayhaps it is quicker than witdrive. I cannot reckon surely. But thus is found on each end of the navelgrit, whenever one should bother to look, one douthsome, and one nithing fraught halfball. The douthsome halfball of one mote then hounds the nithing of another, which makes up the navelrigging. The nithing halfball's striving to flight makes the quavering drive-like-tides and one-only gleestaff, the songs of worldmaking.

The unlikehood between aldstuffs is down to the bulkweight of navelgrits by motescoring. Heavenly grits have a score of each fraughtship, douthsome, nithing, and whether; Firelike grits have twoscore of each fraughtship; Loftish have fourscore; Waterish and Fleshish ones have eightscore ; Woodish, ten-and-sixscore; Earthish, thirty-and-twoscore; and Blomish, mightily big, have sixty-and-fourscore. And yet they are still soothmightily small beyond wonder - like to dustmotes as dustmotes are to mountains. A thimblesworth of peat holds thrisands more Earthish grits than all the shores of Mhungard have grits of sand. Forsooth more so of their own inner motes, like dust motes to the world-whole.

Aldstuffs readily bind and sunder, as said, nigh the Lundworld's love of pitchclasping, and careful flowreckoning of weights: It takes six-and-almost-one-half-score of heavenly navelriggings to have mighty enough a drouthsome fraughtship to hound after a blomish strand. Though there are times when aldstuff navelrigs will bind in a way too pitchclashfully unbecoming, or even too pitchclaspingfully handsome, that they sunder uttermightily, and their sundering sunders their own inwise cloves, casting away Moterotten mists of freewandering drightenmotes and elfinmotes - ken far better to most lowfolk as clevercraft inworking.

Yet never does the unsmite sunder. As if shieldcladded like your Wyrmshipfulness against pithy Sjardally arrows and slings, naught can harm it, werly, nor sleightly, in all slightest.

Wherefore, it had been reckoned (by my daft underyokeling, Harkn Quick-Summer, Lordship, not I) that if one could sunder an unsmite, then surely the inwork cast off would outshine Magnar in the Welkyn. Hence our restless delvingship and clevercrafting of the unsmite weapon, the 'Horker's Teeth'.

Though a misworking clod bare worth its weight to weigh down leafs, these are plightful times, Lord, as you ken full. I cannot trust its outdrafting to churlish speech. Kindly tread these bones with care, Great Wyrm, my reard is stronger than so lithe a half-elf yeoman as I should be thought to lundishly kit.

Though for now, work on the 'Horker's Teeth' will abide awhile this yeartide's gelding holds, though I have forbade any fandings further, by as my reard is grown too hoarse to waste on trock, and I do not trust my slackwits to belead any fandings with their knotted tongues.

But I wanted to demonstrate to you all that the two scripts are clearly the same. [Here's one of the elements of the EOM](http://imgur.com/v1mUAdH), and [here's one of the books that was shared recently](http://i.imgur.com/hiXt39N.jpg). The parallels are pretty clear. Especially with the symbol I'm calling Mdot, and the curly w (I've actually started to assign them numbers to try and break the language, but a I've jokingly named a few). There's also two characters that appear to occur together semi-regularly, which is *great* for trying to bust this thing.

It's also clear that now that not all the script is on the same orientation on the EOM. It also makes me speculate that perhaps the EOM is an artifact once belonging to HM. Makes me want to work on translation all the more!

I'm sharing this with everyone so maybe someone with more free time (I won't even be able to play Dragonborn for 2-3 weeks) or technical know-how (I'm still strugling to get the nifs unpacked so I don't have to work from screen shots!) can make some headway here.

I have been wondering about how Vampirism and Lycanthropy affect two of my favorite races, the Khajiit and the Argonians. We all know that the Khajiit have a religious,  spiritual, possibly even biological need to ingest Moon Sugar on a regular basis. It is also well known that the Argonians have a symbiotic relationship with their progenitors, the Hist. While the two relationships are very different from one another, they have in common the fact that both respective races view their relationships as vital and significant to their existence. So my question is thus: What are the effects of Lycanthropy or Vampirism on their symbiotic relationships? If a Khajiit becomes a vampire, does their new found  need for blood outweigh their already established lust for Moon Sugar, or does the Khajiit then need each equally? In the same respect, if an Argonian becomes a lycanthrope, how does this affect his/her relationship to the Hist? It has been mentioned that Werecrocodiles are not exactly obscure in the land of Black Marsh, so do those same werecrocs still share in the hive mind? Is the hive mind overriden when blood-lust takes the Argonian? Obviously the same questions can (and hopefully will) be applied in reverse. How would the Hist hive mind handle the new impulses and urges for blood of a newly made Argonian vampire? Would the physically addictive urge for Moon Sugar override the newly turned Khajiit Were-wolf/lion/vulture's bestial nature, or would they now crave flesh and Sugar equally? Since to my knowledge there is no established canon relating to my questions, please feel free to put forth any conjecture on the subject. I'm not looking for strictly *what we know*, so let your ideas flow! I'm very curious as to what you guys think on the topic, and will be checking the thread regularly. I will try to reply to any and all comments seeking to engage in discussion.

Before I go on ranting about the week I would just like to congratulate the subreddit and the community for reaching **8000 Scholars**. That didn't take long. It amazes me to say we have racked yet another 1000 subscribers, and have done so in 21 days, which is amazing considering how specific and normally small the subreddit is. 

This particular week we have gained 410 new scholars, yet another amusingly large number. I'd like to once again welcome in all the newcomers, thank you all for joining in. For all of you who don't already know, it is very important for anybody planning on posting or commenting to carefully read through:

* The FAQ
* The New Scholar's Guide
* The rules and voting guidelines

All three of those can be found on the sidebar. If you post or comment without having read those do not be surprised if you get downvoted or your post is removed, so it would much appreciated if you took some time to read through all of those. 

In case you are new, these threads are meant to be the only threads where non lore-related discussion is accepted. Here I give both a weekly overview, a title of ""Scholar of the Week"" and a space for people to talk about anything they want or give the mods any suggestions or criticism. No comments are removed, no downvotes are given, so feel free to do whatever here.

Right, that said, let us move on to the:

**Weekly Overview**

I must say, despite the massive amount of newcomers, something that always overpopulates the subreddit with simple question threads, we did have a great variety of great posts this week going along with all the great discussion in the comment threads. Those include [The Worth of the Soul: The Subtext of a Dragon’s Duel By Ishullanu]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170nio/the_worth_of_the_soul_the_subtext_of_a_dragons/), [The nature loving Mer of Tamriel's south by Mr_Flippers](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1791f2/the_nature_loving_mer_of_tamriels_south/), [Aka-What? A run-down of the horrible and confusing mess that we know as the Dragon God of Time]
(http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/172iwb/akawhat_a_rundown_of_the_horrible_and_confusing/) and
 [The Bite of the Menders](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1797ch/the_bite_of_the_menders/), both by Dbcification, and finally [Treatise on Bosmeri Ships](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/177t6t/treatise_on_bosmeri_ships/), [Oracle Bone Transcription](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/174ejg/oracle_bone_transcription_maormeri_text/) and my personal favorite post I've probably ever read in /r/teslore, [The Raid on Pyandonea](
http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/170264/raid_on_pyandonea/), all of those by OPgreenback.

Aside from that we've also had a lot of great discussion on the many different question threads. I personally very much enjoyed discussing my outrageous military theories with you guys this week, it seems that thread exploded with stuff after I posted it. I'm sorry if I didn't answer all of your questions and concerns, had a bit of a hard time keeping up with the 70+ responses.

It'd also very good to see the new people fitting in so well. The lack of discrimination against new people and the welcoming discussion is a breath of fresh air, so thanks y'all for that. 

That's all for the weekly Overview, let's move on to the:

**Scholar of the Week**

Well, don't really need to give much of a fancy intro on this one, I think it was quite obvious from the beginning of the week who's taking the prize. This week, **OPgreenback** has been showing off his arsenal of extremely well written Apocryphas and monkey truth, drawing in lots of attention. One particular thread, the Raid on Pyandonea, has been a project I've been looking towards being posted for what? a month now? Anyways, great job, Greenback, hope to see more from you in the future! Let's hope your arsenal isn't out of guns quite yet.

---

That's all for this week, folks. Congratulations again in the new subscriber milestone and thank you for all the nice, welcoming discussion put up both by the oldies and the newcomers alike. 

Please do go ahead and provide any feedback or criticism you might have for the mods, as well as tell me about your week or introduce yourself if you are new. Otherwise you are welcome to do as you wish in the comments.

Thank you everyone for the activity, keep on posting, and have a great week!

I do believe the time has finally come for a normal, moderately average thread. My scheduling issues are solved, we have no large announcements this week (though next week will be quite exciting, hopefully). So, in the absurdly normal way of things:

---

This week was undoubtedly one of the busiest weeks we've had in a while. I cannot reference any specific discussions or posts as being much greater than others, but that is simply because of the overwhelming amount of posts and discussion this week. I've counted about 25 threads this week, each one with heavy discussion. This almost doubles the normal amount of activity, so thank you all for your contributions!

To add to that, we have gained a *very* large amount of new scholars this week. With 174 new or returning scholars just this week, we are now only 60 scholars from reaching the 6000 scholar mark. I cannot truly express how amazing this is. Compared to many other subreddits, we are a very small community, but it is those subreddits that draw their popularity from mildly entertaining content that you could scroll through or view for about three seconds. I do believe /r/teslore is different, our userbase is collectively intelligent and strongly connected, and the fact that there are so many of us grouped together is truly amazing. Of course, /r/teslore is also about influence. From the subreddit many other smaller subreddits were created, some of which are /r/falloutlore and /r/tamrielscholarsguild. It only saddens me that those subreddits are not as popular.

So without further ranting I'd also like to present our

**Scholar of the Week**

My decision this time was to mention one user who probably should have received the honors a long time ago. **Anonymous_Mononymous** is probably one of the subreddit's most active and well respected users, and has been especially active this week, so it is only logical to the honors. Thank you, Anonymous, for your continued contribution to the subreddit, and for your magical ability to somehow *always* respond first to the Community Threads.

---

Anyway, thank you all for your contributions. As always, don't forget to:

* Introduce yourself if you are new, or just a lurker
* Give us mods any feedback you might have.
* Ask any question you might have.
* Tell me about your week. I've had a particularly fun week, debating and returning to post in /r/tamrielscholarsguild. Also, I just discovered The Mountain Goats last night. How'd I never know about that band before? They're pretty damn good.

And of course do whatever. Discuss, announce, post, whatever. ComThreads are free, if you wanna post a picture of a cute bunny you found, go ahead.

That is all I have to say. Keep on doing what you do and have a great week!

1349631569.0,27,self.teslore,113f81,Use of Magic in Nirn,,29,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/113f81/use_of_magic_in_nirn/,"**EDIT:  Sub-question related to what I've written below.  How much are we to count the world we encounter in the games and the design of the games and gameplay as ""lore""?  Is lore JUST books and basic plot of the game or does it extend beyond that?**

I've heard people complain about the ease of play in Oblivion and Skyrim vs. earlier games.  The chief complaint revolves around the ease of creating races/classes (as in very little thought has to be put into it intially).  I'll admit, when I stare down the barrel of beginning Morrowind or Arena, I fear that I'm going to put points in the wrong category or level incorrectly or whatever and end up having an unviable character at the end.  This is especially true regarding magic.  Before beginning, I'd like to establish one a priori principle.  While it is likely that the change in magic usage is merely due to game mechanics and not an intentional lore sift by the creators, for the purposes of this discussion, I'm assuming that the shift reflects an actual reality in Nirn and not just the whims of game creators.  

A summary of magic (as I understand it) in previous games:

* In the earliest games, magic was either impossible or impractical unless you were of a specific race and, even then, unless you trained and planned very carefully after that.
* At least in Morrowind (and, probably, in Daggerfall and Arena as well), you did not regenerate magic.  You had to sleep, drink a potion or absorb to replenish your magic store.  (Presumably, this was also the case for health and stamina, but those aren't the topic at the moment.)  
* Both in Oblivion and in Skyrim, magic replenishes at a relatively fast pace, especially compared to earlier games, and can replenish at a lightning fast pace with the proper enchantments.  
* ALL races are able to use magic (albeit, some initially more effectively than others) and it's almost as easy to be an Orc illusion mage or an Altmer, heavy-armor swordsman.  

WHAT HAPPENED, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND CULTURALLY?

* **Genetics:** Mer are naturally more adept at magic than either men or beast-kin.  We know from the Bretons that intermixing with mer creates a people more adept at using magic as well.  Thus, we can assume that slow inter-breeding with mer and Bretons has gradually introduced magical abilities into the general population.  
* **Culture:** Historically, it is arguable that, until Tiber Septim, there wasn't a way for the intermixing of cultures.  In Oblivion, one of the things I didn't like was the homogeny of people and cultures in Cyrodiil.  Presumably, this is because, when people live together for an extended period of time, they become more and more similar.  As Oblivion was the first game where magic become, for the most part, viable for any race, this lends credence to the idea.  This further reinforces the ""Genetics"" theory as well.  Oblivion takes place at the end of the Septim dynasty, hundreds of years of relative peace and intermingling of cultures AND peoples.
* **Absorption of Aetherius:** This is the most extreme of my theories.  IF Aetherius is the source of magic AND the sun is actually a hold to Aetherius formed by Magnus THEN we can assume that prolonged exposure to Aetherius might have some effect on the peoples of Nirn.  This effect could be one or both of the following: A) Increased ability to use magic by races which, previously, couldn't and/or B) increased ability to regenerate magic without having to use potions, sleeping or absorbing.  That means it's either being absorbed directly from Aetherius OR, more interestingly, people are generating it on their own.  

**ANOTHER EDIT:  One responder pointed out that it has been a relatively short amount of time between Morrowind and Skyrim.  Which reminded me I neglected one important point.  If the mixing of peoples in Cyrodiil contributed at all to the shift in the ability to use magic, then the evens of Oblivion and after would play into this.  At first, the majority of people with the increased ability to use magic would be centered in Cyrodiil.  Then, after the Oblivion Crisis and the Great War, there would be a diaspora of sorts, sending people of every stripe scattering everywhere.**",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1349646081.0,,,True,t3_113f81,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/113f81/use_of_magic_in_nirn/,

As the lore-goer will know, TES lore has always been shaped by fan speculation, to the point where, in many areas, it has become impossible to tell what has been gradually built upon by fans, and what was there to begin with. What, then, is the point of ""conjecture tags"", if we already breathe conjecture on a daily basis? It's simple - use of this feature is for first-hand speculation only, ie. information you're fully aware you're making up yourself. The intention is to save you time explaining and for better understanding of information origin.

[Example](/g ""It looks like this,"") and is done in the same way you do a [](/s ""spoiler tag""), only you replace the ""/s"" with a ""/g"" (remember: *""g"" for green""*). As with spoiler tags, the label at the front of the tag can be personalized so you can change it to anything you like, such as ""conjecture"", ""speculation"", or ""pulling from my ass"".

Note: Information should not be dismissed just because it's in green. TES lore is built upon principles of ass-pulling and gap-filling. The purpose of this is to *encourage* speculation, not discourage it.

An interesting development that I've noticed is how Redguards are not as wary of magic as there once were. Although I believe that their dislike for Illusion may remain, I believe that they may be overall less distrustful of other schools. The bounty hunters in ""My Time of Need"" use paralyze, and Falion is a Redguard conjurer, and I'm aware of other Redguard mages about.

Something else that is interesting to note, is how people act in their home province, compared to how they act elsewhere. Morrowind and Oblivion show Nords as being rude drunkards, but in Skyrim, we see that these people are a minority, and that most Nords are a generally hard-working and modest people.

1336809408.0,26,self.teslore,tjfqx,The Trial at Hogithum Hall,Prince-of-Plots,32,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/tjfqx/the_trial_at_hogithum_hall/,"I'm sure you're all familiar with (or at least have heard of) the Trial of Vivec roleplay, done in 2004. If you aren't, I'll explain it in a sec. The Imperial Library has a summary up, which is all I had read until a few days ago. They also have the full RP archived for perusal, so I decided I'd finally dig into that.

I soon found, however, it was a bit of a headache. It was in html format, so it wasn't exactly easy on the eyes. There were people trying to jump awkwardly into the RP, and people taking the topic away to something else, so there was more than one conversation at once a lot of the time.

So, I had an idea. To compile the Trial of Vivec in one place, and trim it and polish it off for convenient and streamlined read. So I did it, and I've named my adapted version ""The Trial at Hogithum Hall"". Has more of a ring to it than ""The Trial of Vivec"", I think.

Here's a summary of what I've done to the original:

* Only the dialogue of the characters were extracted, so the usernames and signatures and whatnot don't clutter anything up. You'll be reading concentrated *awesome*.

* Dialogue that I felt took away from the flow too much was taken out (stuff that doesn't wholly matter, I didn't delete any good stuff).

* Characters that I felt that didn't add anything were taken out altogether. If something of worth was contributed by them, I worked it into someone else's dialogue. I didn't do this a lot, as I wanted to stay true to the characters and the people behind them.

* Some dialogue has been moved around or broken to compensate for the quoting feature forums allow for. Unfortunately, I couldn't get rid of *all* the ""quoting"", but hopefully it's not too much of a bother.

* The four forum threads the RP was done in have been separated into ""acts"". No real reason for this, but it does make it look like more of a play, which is nice. Along that line, out-of-character narration has been incorporated into ""stage directions"", if you will.

* The grammar has been cleaned up, so (I hope) there's not a single grammatical error in it. Particularly difficult for the guy who started the first thread, because I'm quite sure English was not his first language.

I do feel a little bad for changing some things, it feels like I'm betraying the spirit of the writers. Alas, I have, and I hope (should they stumble across this) that the participants would not be offended.

For those that don't know what the Trial of Vivec is, I'll explain. It was a thread on the official roleplaying forums in 2004 where a member called ""zingbat"" proposed Vivec be tried for the murder of Nerevar and other crimes he is accused of having committed. Other members tell him it'd be impossible, but then Vehk himself shows up (played by MK) and the whole thing blows up. There are heaps of other guest star appearances throughout the RP, and at least five developers in total take part. For this reason, despite it being a roleplay involving many fans, many consider it to be canon.

Now, even though it's been snipped up a bit, it's still pretty damn big. It's around 60 pages with size 9 font, and it's at about 27000 words. That's like, almost half of a small novel. My browser struggles to look at it online, so you might have better luck downloading it (File &gt; Download as...).

Because of its size, it's not like any other text that can be looked at in a matter of minutes. You have to be dedicated to it. And if you're thinking ""I've read the summary, there's no need to read the whole thing"", I'll just say that I was thoroughly surprised by the depth of the full RP. There's a lot of lore discussion in there, there's tragedy, there's comedy, and there's even a bit of romance in there (cheeky Vehk). I recommend reading it.

Without further ado, [you may find ""*The Trial of Hogithum Hall*"" here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HMTlozPtQr9uKSp6nyRu8z7JsF7ECkTEFEYckvdvUjI/edit). Again, be wary of its size. I hope this is meaningful to some, it was certainly no small task it compiling it. Enjoy.

Know that at the beginning, it is a little awkward. Once there's a firm cast, a plot, and objective, it gets real good.

Also, please refrain from spoiling the Trial here, for those who haven't yet read it. Many thanks.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,True,,Council,True,t3_tjfqx,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/tjfqx/the_trial_at_hogithum_hall/,

Those of you who recognize my name probably haven't seen me here in some time. As I said a few months ago, I am working on what I hope to be a comprehensive, easily readable guide to Orsimeri lore, suitable for both beginners and advanced scholars.

I am currently on the history section, and am stuck on the events concerning the transformation from Trinimac into Malacath at Boethiah's hand.

I am aware that there are several different theories concerning the events, and I am hoping to either cover all of them with proper treatment, or prove one and disprove the others, depending on what we know.

1. The first and most-accepted theory is that Boethiah directly consumed Trinimac and Malacath was the result of that by the expected processes. This also changed the Aldmer with Trinimac into the Orsimer.

2. The second theory is that Boethiah murdered Trinimac and established Malacath, an independent, Daedric entity in Trinimac's place, and Malacath forcibly took the Orsimer.

3. The third theory is that Trinimac and the western deity known as Ebonarm are the same, and that Boethiah is responsible for the ebony arm-and-sword. I am not well versed in this theory, and I believe it to be OPGreenback who first told it to me. (Edit: /u/Anonymous_Mononymous proffers [this speculation](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1equ0f/why_is_ebonarm_despised_by_nearly_all_the_known/ca35uv9)\)

Everytime I'm in such a discussion, two opinions stand out.
1. An artifact is infused with a fragment/blood of a daedric prince
2. An artifact has to be created by a daedra (my personal opinion)

Now let's take Goldbrand for example. In the Oblivion mainquest ""Blood of the Daedra"" (that title), Martin asks you to get a daedric artifact for him so he can create the portal to Camorans realm. Goldbrand is on the list of daedric artifacts you can give.

but if we look at the descripcion of Goldbrand in Yagrum Bagarn's Tamrielic Lore it says: 
This magical Sword is almost a complete mystery. Thieves tell tales about its golden make and how it was actually forged by ancient dragons of the North. Their tales claim that it was given to a great knight who was sworn to protect the dragons. The Sword lends its wielder the ability to do fire damage on an enemy. Goldbrand has not been sighted in recent history and is said to be awaiting a worthy hero.

as far as I understand it, this rules both of the above mentioned theories out.

so that means either:
1. Above theories are both wrong
2. The legend/Yagrum is wrong
3. Goldbrand on the list has somehow game mechanic reasons
or 
4. I don't know jack shit about daedric artifacts.

Anyone care to enlighten?

1361657319.0,26,self.teslore,193m32,Altmeris Language Construction,myrrlyn,30,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/193m32/altmeris_language_construction/,"Following far behind in the footsteps of /u/lu_ming, the racial subreddits have begun working on construction lore-friendly (we hope) languages for [Altmeris](/r/Altmer) and [Orcish](/r/Orsimer). I have done a fair amount of work in the IRC with /u/Sampsonite20, and I would like to share what I have created so far. I have written a post on /r/Altmer with more detail that I will be fleshing out as I go, but I want to get your opinions.
____
### The language itself

I am basing this off of words we see in-universe and what just *feels* High Elven to me. It's not an exact science, but neither is language, so I guess that works.

W and Y make more frequent appearances than they do in English/Tamrielic, and vowels are very common. Hard consonants appear rarely, and as a result K, B, P, Z, and DJ are almost never found. Rather, Altmeris prefers flowing consonants and word structure. M, N, S, T, R, L, V, and H do not impede speech flow and are the most common consonants. Consonantal combinations are also extremely rare, although H can be attached to consonants to shape them (HN, RH, etc).

An example word I created would be *Ahieryae*, which I created as a name. It is pronounced Ah-ear-yah-ee, or Ah-hear-yay in the vulgar.

### Linguistic structure

Languages follow their speakers. Altmer are very organized, thoughtful, and structured, and at the same time multi-faceted, artistic, and highly symbolized. This is reflected in the structure of their language and vocabulary. Words have many meanings, not all of which are synonymous, and require context to determine with precision what they are, but their sentences are arrayed consistently and clearly.

Word order for clauses follows these patterns:

* Independent clause-first dependent-second dependent-nth dependent

* accusative-dative-VERB-genitive-nominative.

* nominative-vocative

* modified-modifier

* ablative-phrase

In cases where multiple modifiers affect both a modified word AND each other, a ~ is used to conjoin them, and the proper suffixes are affixed only to the last word. Earlier words overflow onto later words in a ~ chain, but later do not necessarily define earlier.

With the influx of Cyrodiilic languages, primarily the , operator, dependent clauses have become allowed to be placed in the primary clause, rather than attached at the end. In artistic script, the main clause remains unbroken and the dependents are attached at the word which they modify. With enough of these, flowery language ceases to be merely a metaphor.

### Formality, Intensity, and Elevation

Altmeris is a first-child of the EHLNOFEX language, and as such retains several significant aspects of it. Although EHLNOFEX has much harsher phonetic elements (CHIM keem) that do not translate into Altmeris, much of it is retained in the High Elevation. This is seen in that High Elevation words are typically written in full capitalization, and are shorter words and have more vague or wandering meanings.

* AI: to be. AI encompasses all forms of the state of being. It is used for High formality, such as sword names, coronations, and such. Although it's High status means it should not be used in everyday conversation, I will use it as such to demonstrate. *AI MYRRLYNE* means I AM myrrlyn (the -e is vocative). *AI /R/TESLORE* means YOU ALL ARE /r/TESlore. *AI XENOPOSEIDON* is HE IS xenoposeidon. *AI /R/SHITTYTESLORE* is THEY AND SOME OF WE ARE /r/shittyteslore. I assume you see my meaning. It isn't just an identifier or a statement of being. It is related to the EHLNOFEX *AE*, a statement of absolute IS.

* AH-: AH- is the root of LOVE. It has many suffixes to relate to the many forms of LOVE. AHN is PASSION, AHR is LUST, AHL is BETRAYAL, for one may only betray those they love, and AHM is DEDICATION. The suffix -ë, the antonymic, may also be attached. AHNË is PASSIONATE HATRED. AHRË is DISGUST. AHMË is FIERCE OPPOSITION. Again, the Tamrielic ""translation"" is written in full capitalization to indicate that these are concepts, and far broader than our words can capture.

Altmeris also recognizes, and uses primarily, the low elevation. Notice that this is written with no capitalization. Capitalization is occasionally used in Altmeris to indicate proper status (names) or the beginning of a sentence, for the Beginning is always important.

Low elevation words are longer, more defined, and have mildly different phonetics than High Elevation. I have only created a few words, and have taken a few from the known body of language as well.

### Word Formation

Altmeris follows the Latin method of prefixing and suffixing roots to change their form, and is both more complicated and simple than Latin's.

Personal pronouns: the simplest way to write them is (m,t,s)u(i,o)(e,o,n,s,l,e). In order, the sets are: person (1,2,3), U for phonetics, plurality (S,P), and case (nom,gen,dat,acc,abl,voc). Thus, the first person singular nominative pronoun (what I would use when speaking at you), is *muie*. You all, the recipients, would be *tuon* or *tuos*, depending on my verb and structure choice.

### Vocabulary

In no particular order, these are words I have created or used.

* *amufi-*: Love (v). Notice that this is polysyllabic and sounds different from the High Elevation AH-, even though they are both related to love. AHN, LOVE, is a High Concept, and ideal in its form. *amufi-* is low, and mundane. It refers both to the emotion and to the action of love.

* *uliy-*: In Altmeris, being thankful and grateful is a transitive verb, rather than the states of being that it is in Tamrielic. This makes it difficult to translate directly.

* *amnuis-*: This is an adjective, meaning several things. Swift, graceful, close, beautiful (not a measure of physical attractiveness), elegant, flowing.

* *moeya*: This is an exception verb, and showcases the Altmeris blur between being and doing. It means both I am and I do, and sort of I send/throw/pass.

* *alt-*: Most commonly taken to mean high, in either physical distance or philosophical state. It also means true (not Boolean), far, right (not as in right hand), and some more. The -ë suffix makes it deep, close, fatal, sundering, and such.

* *Orsi-*: As you well know, this means pariah, exile, outcast, ostracized, alien-in-his-own-kind.

* *-mer*: This can be both a suffix or a standalone word, meaning family, clan, close-knit-group, gathering, band, kind, kin, those-in-common.

* *elweny-*: The Y is not a vowel. Vowel suffixes are appended to the root. The root is pronounced el-when and with a suffix -ae, el-when-yah-ee.

### Pronunciation

Diphthongs are typically pronounced as individual letters, though they can be slur-blended. Vowels are long or short as befits. E can be read as eh and ay both, for example. Where consonants have multiple forms, the softer is chosen. The only real rule of the language is that it must flow easily and articulately when spoken.

I will certainly be adding to this as time goes on, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on what we've done so far and where we take this in the future.

Welcome to yet another late Weekly Community Thread. I'm sure you guys are getting sick of waiting an extra day for these, and I am sorry about that. Real life gets in the way of many things, especially when it comes to management of time, and sometimes I am simply unable to provide a well thought out weekly review in time, something that has happened for example yesterday and is about to happen these next two weeks. I will say it now so that you fine folks wouldn't be surprised later on, I am about to go on a vocation for a duration of around 9 days during which the other moderators will try their hands at the community threads. 

Right, anyways, to go back on topic, this week was certainly as bustling a week as any we have had lately, with lots of newcomers and lots of questions. I am very happy to announce that despite having certain off topic discussions that we sadly had to remove, it seems by general observation that all new newcomers are doing a pretty darn good job of keeping to the rules are reading the FAQ. Thank you all for that, it certainly made us mods happy.

**Weekly Overview**

Well, as I said, it certainly was a very busy week. Other than some good explanation threads such as [A Loo~~f~~k at Vvardenfell's Noteworthy Creatures by Undoer](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1853lh/a_look_at_vvardenfells_noteworthy_creatures/) and [Imperial Essay on Skyrim's Dependancy on Horkers by Lorfiend](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/184dps/imperial_essay_on_skyrims_dependancy_on_horkers/), we have been pretty much overstocked with question threads this week, and have seen some great scholarly responses from all the discussing scholars. We also had a lot of newcomers this specific week, with 283 new subscribers this week.

So yes, as you can probably tell, we are pretty happy about how things are going. Thank you all for your activity, keep at it.

---

**Scholar of the Week**

We have a pretty definite choice for Scholar of the Week this week. This scholar has been extremely active in discussions lately, and I personally have seen him around pretty much most of the threads I have visited this week. Thank you, *Undoer*, for your continuous contributions to the subreddit this week! You are now officially with all the others in the Hall of Fame, congratulations.

---

That is all I have to say for this week. Nothing to stress too badly except how sorry I am that the thread came so late. Thank you all for making it another great week in the subreddit and for maintaining our name as the best subreddit to answer anybody's lore questions. I think we are all making a pretty good impression on the so-called ""outside"" subreddits. That is good.

Right, I will see you all again in the discussions this week and the community thread on Feb. 22nd when I'm back from the (hopefully) sort-of hot beaches of California. Thank you for your activity everyone, and have a great week!

However I was looking at a map of Tamriel which has particular places of interest marked with an X. Notably the famous Labyrinthian in Skyrim. Then I got onto finding something in Elsweyr. A place called ""Hall of the Colossus"".

Now I wont be going into that. But the Hall of the Colossus is basically meant to be a huge place which was the place the Numidium was built, which caused some weird magic, not unlike radiation IMO, which has messed up the land around it.

This makes me have to ask, Exactly how far have the Dwemer been? If they were in Elsweyr without a presence in Cyrodiil, how did they get there? Underground Black Marsh?

And a second question, who built the Hall of the Colossus? if we're going to say that it wasn't really the Dwemer than the other builders would have been Giants, which is even weirder since they would have to have come down from the Jerall mountains and walked through Cyrodiil and into the heart of Elsweyr to build some giant building for Hermorah-knows-why. Also under the assumption that the Dwemer didn't have anything to do with it then the land was already messed up most likely by Nirni, but then how/why did the Giants go through all of that for so long to build that place?

I'm here to propose a second noobish battery of questions, as the title describes. I'm now more familiar with the labyrinthine subjects of the Elder Scrolls universe, but there are still some outstanding questions concerning everyone's favourite topic, Metaphysics. 
Oh, and some astrology thrown in to add a flavour.

Back to Metaphysics, I've heard CHIM attached to a few phrases or words; namely, the Six Paths (or something to that effect), Amaranth, and A Captive Sage. I know a bit about Amaranth, as it is supposedly the state of being attained by A Captive Sage, post CHIM (if one is to go that far). The questions here are, what are the other Six Paths, if CHIM is one and Amaranth is an extension of CHIM, and what is so very different from basic CHIM (an odd way to put it, I feel), and Amaranth. Oh, and Captive Sages; the hell are they?

Simpler one for the middle of the post: Gradients. I understand they are ""descended"" from the Godhead, are Anu and Padomay, but what else is there? 

Now to bridge the gap. Having read [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17gilm/eye_of_magnus_i_know_were_not_supposed_to_just/), concerning the Eye of Magnus and it's resulting discussion, the sun popped into my head. It is often described as a hole in the sky, literally, but the hypothetical comparison between it, the stars, and the Eye itself had me thinking about the whole structure of the kind of ""hole"" an et'Ada can actually make... --trainwreck-- I stepped away to review the thread, and saw /u/dbcification 's post about his hunt for the Script that is on the Eye's surface. This has left me with about three theories. First, that the Eye is the literal fabric that Magnus tore through when he left Mundus, two, it's the culmination of all the fabric Mangus and the Manga-Ge (Azura included) tore away from the sky and the earth, and three, Herma-Mora had a hand in crafting whatever the Eye is, regardless of the first two theories. What I was building towards from the first half of this paragraph is, like the Eye, the Sun is a sphere, punctured in space by Magnus's departure. This is all conjecture (of course), and I'd like to see if any of these ideas hold water.

To end this already confusing post, I hope this makes for an easier question, if not for subject matter, then at least for the sheer blankness of the slate with which to work; what is an Un-Star, why are they supposedly only in the Serpent Constellation, and should I bring my SCUBA gear for a deluge of lore concerning another Pantheon of gods, protogods, dreampeople, or Molag Bal's cock jammed somewhere it shouldn't be?

Many thoughts and questions, including some that can perhaps be answered by certain folks in /r/AskHistorians:

* What kind of ships are used? We know from Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim the ships vary by region: [Imperial ships](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120912014959/elderscrolls/images/thumb/e/e4/The_katariah.png/1000px-The_katariah.png) were brigantines, ones that rarely had three or more masts. [Dunmeri ships](http://images.uesp.net/c/c4/MW-place-Chun-Ook.jpg) were smaller, single-masted cogs with a singular sail.

[Nordic](http://images.uesp.net/5/5e/SR-place-The_North_Wind.jpg) [ships](http://images.uesp.net/c/c1/SR-place-Wreck_of_the_Winter_War.jpg) are similar to Viking longships and arks.

* What of the naval battles that took place? They are mostly unknown, but any evidence or speculation is appreciated.

* What would be the tactics and ship types of the Dominion, Akaviri, and the Empire?

* What weapons do they use? Fire arrows and Greek fire? What role does magicka play in this?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Tribunal,True,t3_16t3m8,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/16t3m8/naval_military_history_in_tamriel/,

I'd also like to say: Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to get there? If you did, you wouldn't be complaining. This time, though, I think we'll all sleep a little easier.*

It was... An interesting place, the Colored Rooms. Very lively, yet very calm at the same time. Something about the bright lights made me feel like I was wide awake, but still in a dream. I wandered for what felt like days in Meridia's halls, admiring the absence of dark (a welcome feeling after that dreadful visit to Coldharbour) and the sheer luminescence of the entire place. It was like a great chapel built from stones of crystal. Magnificent is the first word that comes to mind.

Aurorans standing vigil at every turn made the trip that much more enjoyable. I knew every moment that I was safe. Eventually, I grew tired of the beauty and decided to find what I came for. Meridia's Chamber. I was led there by an Auroran in shimmering white armor, different from all the others. The room was... Absolutely breathtaking.

It was a massive, crystalline sphere. Rainbows streaming from one point to another, fractals on every surface from some angles, and from others more rainbows. In the center of the room was Meridia, in the form of a bright light. When she spoke, she spoke with a powerful, but benevolent tone, like a mother to a child who asked an innocent question. Her words were soothing, and all very informative.

""You wish to know, yes, mortal? Then I shall tell you. I am Meridia, Defeater of Undeath, Light in the Darkness of Oblivion, and Once-Member of the Cohorts of Magnus. Ah... The last title has piqued your interest, hasn't it? Yes, it is true. I was once among the spirits who fled with Magnus when he saw the truth of Creatia. But, when he fled to Aetherius, it was too late for me. I had abandoned hope of becoming free, and consorted with dark beings. He called me 'impure', and when I attempted to pierce the Veil, I was cast back into the emptiness. I strive always to earn my place among the Magne-Ge, as they are called. I fear, though, that it shall never be so.""

""Before I tried to flee, I counted myself among those aligned with Lorkhan, though his tricks were always too cunning for me to feel close to him and his followers. I often wonder if Magnus considered Lorkhan the impurity that restricted me.""

""Why did I ally with the Serpent? Because change was part of me, and is even more so now. I despise undead, and this is often how people try to resist the forward flow of time. A lover dies, a child is lost in an accident, a family member grows old. People cling to the body and attempt to raise it from its natural death. I despise that, if you cannot let something go, then you are not worthy to have it in the first place. Things change. Accept it and move on.""

I felt, at this stage, that I had gathered enough, and so I thanked the Lady Meridia, and her Aurorans led me out of her realm, and back to this one, soothed and remarkably well-rested, though I noticed my skin dried and cracked from standing in Meridia's presence for so long.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1357779487.0,,Julianos,True,t3_163zs3,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/163zs3/a_journey_into_oblivion_volume_iii_meridias/,

I have read the books in game, have looked at the Wikis, and read this forum a lot.

From what I understand, Alduin is the first born of Akatosh, possibly even a direct aspect of Akatosh.  Some even say that they are one in the same (a very poorly written book by an aspiring Nord author refutes this claim).  His purpose is to consume the world at the end of the Kalpa, as ordained by Akatosh to do so.  I also understand that the Dragonborn has the soul of a dragon as a gift from Akatosh, and that her purpose is to stop Alduin.

I do not understand why Akatosh would give the Dragonborn this gift if it is to stop another agent of Akatosh's will (or possibly even Akatosh himself, depending on your interpretation of their nature).

Does anyone know why this relationship exists?  Or is it possible that stopping Alduin is not the Dragonborn's purpose, but it has been re-directed by Shor?  I know that the Gift of the Voice is from Kynareth, who is connected to Lorkhan, and perhaps the Greybeards (and previous students) want to use the Dragonborn to stop Alduin, but her true purpose from Akatosh is to aid him in some way?  We know that there was a Dragonborn during the old reign of Alduin, and he stated he was asked to stop him but chose not to.

I am curious if anyone who know the lore have an explaination for this.

This has been one of the busiest weeks for the subreddit since a while. We've probably had over twice the regular amount of posts per week, and got an outstanding amount of discussion in each and every post this week. 

We've also gained an amazing 141 subscribers this week. The rate of incoming subscribers continues to amaze us moderators and brings a smile to our faces. 

---

So, to give a weekly overview, it's been a fantastic week for the subreddit. As I've already stated, the sheer amount of posts and activity this week is awe-inspiring. Normally I would list two or three great posts from the latest week in this section, but I think I should really give a proper list on this one seeing as we had so many amazing posts this week. Posts such as:

* [Numbers, by RottenDeaditte](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14hgmx/numbers/ 
)

*  [Orsimer beliefs and culture by A_Generous_Upvote](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14k7ex/orismer_orc_beliefs_culture_and_their_homeland/)

* [Sea Elves and Sea Ysmirs by OPGreenback](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14cvl4/sea_elves_and_sea_ysmirs/)

* [ginja-ninja's explanation of dreamsleeve] (http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14isz6/where_is_the_dreamsleeve_in_relation_to_mundus/c7dn6pe)

* And Dbcification's [Romantization of Nchuand-Zel stone](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14f98f/romanization_of_the_nchuandzel_stone/) and [Post with lots of letters](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14g68p/i_think_i_know_what_the_letters_on_the_eye_of/)

Have contributed greatly to this week. Please do read through all of those if you haven't already.

The amount of activity was justified by the amount of new scholars though. This week followed in the footsteps of the last two weeks with 141 new scholars. 

Since we have so many new scholars, both good and unfortunate things do happen. We get lots of activity, but some is very much unnecessary. As more time passes we realize more questions have been answered too many times to promote real discussion, which is why we have the FAQ.

So, Prince-of-Plots and I have decided to once again **update the FAQ**

We are going to do this by letting you guys choose which new questions we should answer in the FAQ. If you want to submit a question to be answered in the FAQ, post it here in the format shown below:

---

**Question in Bold**

Short, basic, well written answer for the question. This should answer the question accurately and thoughtfully but should not contain too much information or contain any commentary on the question. Please support your answer with sources, and use factual evidence instead of opinion or conjecture unless needed.

*Sources: [1](http://www.imperial-library.info/), [2](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page), [3](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore)*

---

Thank you for contributing to the FAQ. I think Prince is handling the FAQ very well, but we still need the community to find which questions are over-asked and provide those questions with well written answers. 

Thanks, everyone, for participating and posting this week. Keep on being awesome (Or DFTBA, for all you Nerdfighters out there)

Again, it's also time to announce a 

**Scholar of the Week**

This week's pick was very, very difficult. We just had an enormous amount of great activity from all regular and new scholars, so it was very difficult to point out a single scholar.

I do believe that the award should be rewarded to, for the 2nd time (!), **Dbcification**. Db's been extremely active both in posting and commenting this week, to an extent that I believe he should be named Scholar of the Week for the 2nd time. Thank you very much, Db, never stop doing what you do.

---

That concludes what I have to say for this week. We have no announcements this week, but I am asking you all to once again tell me about your week as well as contribute to the FAQ if you are willing and able. 

Thank you everyone for posting and commenting, and have an awesome week.

bore a forlorn but resolute visage, those who have attained a manner of godhood may choose

to enter a place outside of time, where they may live for centuries while in truth only

seconds had passed. Take into account what that may do to someone, total seclusion,

freedom to think with no distraction, no influence, not to mention power enough to enact

one’s every wish. Nigh complete freedom. I believe Sotha Sil partook in this activity far more

than his companions, but I shall elaborate on that later.

I also believe he achieved that state that brings one above the common ideals of reality,

perhaps even further, but did not reach the final state. Why? My personal belief is more

speculation than anything, but I believe it to be the truth. To quote Almalexia “Once,

Sotha Sil was like we are, the Lord Vivec and I. He spent time among these mortals,

instructing them, counseling them, protecting them from harm. He may have loved them

more than any of us, though I know not why. It has been many years since any have seen

the Sorcerer, though. Many more since he took initiates into his service. I believe he grew

weary of mortal imperfections, and retired to his Clockwork City, where he reshapes life,

and some say the very world, into an image he finds pleasing.” I believe he could not

fully leave it all behind, that he did indeed love the people moreso than the other two

mortal gods and that was the reason he retired to the Clockwork City. This world, our

world, begot with so much promise, tainted beyond memory to bear the failures of our

forefathers and repeat them to no end. I understand words spoken by Almalexia are to be scrutinized

conscientiously, but here I do not believe she would lie. Why when she

already purposed on murdering the Nerevarine and deceiving him to have a mind to murder the Tinkerer,

even though she had already murdered him several days before. There might have even

been a slight sting of guilt in the nethermost recesses of her lost mind…

This is how I see Sotha Sil, he loved not just the dunmer, but all those whose plight of existence was tied with the mundus. 

He could not bear to see the world devour itself, the failings of mortals, the ignorance, the irrationality, the hatred. Not

even he could be impervious from his own impeachment, for his godhood was attained by blood, and this one moment of weakness

would haunt him and may in fact have been the primary genesis responsible for the immutable change in his moral compass.

He had tremendous power, but not even its full measure would not have been enough, to stop wars

what was he to do? Force the very minds of men and mer to peace? To tamper so far with

the world was not his way, and any other way the world might not wish to hear him, drowned below their own war-mongering

and power hungry wails. 




His death only supports my theories, or at least in the way that I interpret it. 

When the Nerevarine materialized in the temple, Almalexia, dead, cradled in his arms 

(for this to remain about Sotha Sil, I shall keep my reactions to my next entry, about the late god-queen) 

we all knew there was more to it, as she wore her war-mask. She never carried it

on her and none knew its resting location. He had told us about Almalexia’s words before

she tried to enact her treachery, of how she murdered the poor mage and intended the

same for the Nerevarine. What harrowed my mind until long after my pain of

Almalexia’s madness and demise was but a distant memory was that the Tinkerer had not

fought back, but rather watched in silence as she robbed him of his life. Not a word, not a

scream. It is of my opinion that he did indeed feel agony from the situation, but not

physical, I believe he felt pain from seeing Almalexia in her current maddened state,

another victim of mortal folly. He may have even expected it, foreseen it, whether by

simple reflection or divination is irrelevant. The frenzied god-queen spoke even of killing

Vivec. Perhaps he wanted death, perhaps he thought he deserved it, as he robbed the

Heart of its power, maybe he thought he could have done more for Nirn and blamed

himself for his inability to aid its inhabitants, we may never know, all we can do is wonder.



With all his power, his knowledge, he was powerless to stop the world from tearing itself

apart, so he sought solace elsewhere, in a world of his own making, his Clockwork City

free from guilt, pain, influence and other negative emotions. Oft people wonder where it

is located, the speculation is rampant. Were I to make an assumption, however, I would

think that it is not even located inside Mundus, he constructed it to be an escape and a

refuge, I cannot imagine he would have placed it on the very world he tried so hard to

avoid. Although, he did say once that all speculation of its location were

both true and false, were we to speculate wildly, perhaps it is indeed everywhere?

Everywhere at once, so infinitely small that we cannot see it, yet from it, from everywhere,

he shapes things to a better and more prosperous future? At the same time a

metaphorical and literal place? I have other potential ideas but discussing them and their ramifications would take long.

Were it only that we had a clue, or maybe we the answer lies there, right in front of us, buried beneath the riddles…

I had a meeting with Divayth Fyr, one of the few lucky enough to have gained the tinkerer's interest and friendship. 

My own station afforded me a chance to see Seht in person once, he was strikingly unique, with his mechanical attire and his golden 


mask. I remember his eyes, the only think peeking from behind that veil, but it was enough to

see the exasperation and the guilt. He looked at me as he walked by, he lowered his eyes

quickly enough, I suspect my own mask was not one he wished to remember… I had

never paid that memory much thought until now, our conditioning was so complete, I can

hardly blame him for avoiding us. He was an infinitely interesting character, speaking

sometimes hurtful truths without noticing he may have caused harm.

Forgive me if I tend to digress ever so often, I find little details often more useful than

direct information when it comes to true understanding of a person’s mind. Returning to

Divayth, he informed me he had actually visited the metallic maze in person and told me

of its mind-boggling scope and of its mechanical inhabitants. Although he only caught

simple glimpses of it, nothing enough to draw a complete idea. One silver lining though,

was his manner around the old telvanni wizard and the other enlightened psijic students.

I felt somewhat relieved to hear of his more enthusiastic attitude, even if it was only to be witnessed by a select few.



Finally I will end with the more unfounded rumors and speculation surrounding the great

mage. Once again a quote from Almalexia “He began to speak of the fall of the Tribunal

and the return of the Old Gods. But Sotha Sil is not a Seer; he is a Maker. He shapes the

Here and the Now, while only I have been privy to what is to come. I know this...he is no

longer the man he once was."" Obviously, we notice the god-queen had no talent whatsoever in

foresight, dieing only several hours after this statement. But it begs the question, why this

specifically? Was she in fact envious of her brother’s potential ability to see the future?

Her first words disclose that he knew of the fall of the tribunal, though she uses them to mock him

they turned out eventually to be naught but truth. Azura, anticipation of Sotha Sil,

certainly proved to dabble in prophecy. Again, this is all only speculation. To end, I

suppose I will address the latest hearings of the Heart of Lorkhan, and Seht’s pact with

the daedric princes. As for what he promised the lords of oblivion, I cannot say, his soul?

The heart? Artifacts? I lean towards choosing the heart. Few knew of its existence, much

less its location, and even less would be able to track it down should it have moved.

Recent rumors in Skyrim indicated it might have been locked away in a dwemer lockbox,

before its recent re-opening. It is of one of my theories that the one to have placed it there

was Sotha Sil (in whatever short time of his life remained between the fall of the sixth house and the Nerevarine's arrival in 

Mournhold), safe from the schemes of the princes. Once again all of these are just the

musings of an old mer, all speculation and theories, I have others of course but I fear that

were I to write them all down my hands would fail me. The irony is almost painful. Do with

these as you wish, I simply wanted to compile my thoughts of the mer and maybe clear up

some of the mystery behind him. However I must regrettably inform that, without access

to the clockwork city and perhaps his memoirs, we may never discover who he truly was.

Well, in human dreams, there are often consistencies, called Dream Signs, that are found in all or many of the dreamer's dreams. These can range from an unusually large segment of the population wearing watches to the sky being streaked with turquoise forks of lightning with clouds of neon pink. Most dreamers don't mark these things as being out of the ordinary while dreaming, but one of the techniques lucid dreamers use is to learn to recognize these signs, and therefore to recognize that they are dreaming. This is undoubtably useful, but one can be sure that these signs did not evolve for that purpose.

Some signs can help the lucid dreamer determine what will happen in the dream before it happens. For example, a loud car horn may consistently signify that the setting or landscape of the dream is about to change. Dreams about dying might always be accompanied by one's favorite song being played on the radio.

I was also under the impression that dragon souls are either absorbed between dragons or if there is no dragon around to absorb the soul it is returned to Akatosh, this would imply a dragon soul is not subject to the same processes that normal black and white souls are (I unfortunately do not recall a source on this, feel free to correct this assumption). Certain events from Dawnguard seem incompatible with this view of dragon souls, and I would like any help I could get on clarification.

 First of all there is Durnehviir's relationship with Soul Cairn and the Ideal Masters. Though not literally soul trapped by the Ideal Masters they show a measure of control over it, exempting it from the natural dragon soul processes (such as the Dovahkiin absorbing Durnehviir's soul upon his defeat). This could possibly be explained by the power of the Ideal Masters and their realm, with their authority over the souls in their dominion being strong enough to trap something otherwise uncontainable. Although again this is not the strict definition of soul trapping, and even the ideal masters might not be able to physically force a dragon soul into a gem.

 What seems more damning to the idea of dragon souls being untrappable is Serena's ability to partially soul trap the Dovahkiin's soul when entering the portal to Soul Cairn. Now my understanding is that the Dovahkiin is a dragon born into the body of a mortal, with a literal soul of a dragon and the ability to absorb other dragons souls into their own. If this is true then Serena has shown it is possible for a sufficiently advanced necromancer to at least somewhat capture the soul of a dragon, within a gem, and it could potentially be used for enchantment.

 Here are some conceivable explanations for how Serena could accomplished her soul trapping without it meaning that dragons could be soul trapped in general. The Dovahkiin's soul could possibly have a black soul aspect of it, meaning Serena could not of soul trapped the Dovahkiin as a whole but merely skimmed out the mortal part, and could not do so with a pure dragon soul. Perhaps there is a physical aspect to a dragons skin (maybe magical properties of their scales) that is responsible for their inability to be soul trapped, though this explanation ignores the unique properties dragon souls possess. Another justification of how Serena accomplished this feat is that she took a very small portion of the Dovahkiin, and that normally a dragon's soul would be far too large for any ordinary gem, but by this theory Azure's star should be able to contain a dragon soul.

 These are just a couple of ideas, and I am curious to see what others think of this issue. Am I mistaken on how dragon souls function? Are there better explanations for Durnehviir's current state and Serena's soul trapping ability? If this does confirm that dragon souls are capable of being trapped, what would be the implications of that?

A question I've been wondering since learning about the Great War was what Nord-Redgaurd race relations are like? It's no secret that most Nords are suspicious at best of elves, argonians, and kahjit's, but do Nords view Reguards similarly to Imperials (i.e. not as brave/hardy/awesome as us, but still respectable)? Or is there distrust or some other view entirely? Considering the Redguards' choice to continue fighting in the Great War, do Nords see them with great respect? I would normally assume so, but I would have expected some Stormcloak in the game to laud Redguard bravery. The only evidence I can think of, personally, is that there are a handful of Nord-Redguard marriages in Skyrim. Are there any other pieces of evience I may be missing?

**Edit/Update**: So something interesting happened today while playing Skyrim. I was on my way to Ivarstead, traversing the Rift, and I saw two Alik'r men interrogating a lone (strangely blonde) redguard woman, believing her to be the the woman they were looking for (from the quest in Whiterun). The interesting part was that afterwards, the Redguard woman said something along the lines of ""tch, foreigners"" viewing the Alik'r with disdain.

Is it possible or even common knowledge (whether this theory is true or not) that each playthrough of the games is actually a reading of the Elder Scrolls? Let me explain.

We see in Skyrim that the Dragonborn, when reading the [Book of Fate](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Book_of_Fate), sees nothing, indicating that the player character's truly has free will and is not bound by prophecy. This can be a bit problematic because of the prophecy of the last Dragonborn, but it could be that the player character is free to fulfill that prophecy or not, just like the Nerevarine prophecy. If the Dragonborn happens to choose not to fulfill the prophecy, another could be born or discovered to take up that mantle. Anyhow, I think it's general knowledge that no player character is bound by fate in any of the games.

Then comes the problem of writing the history of the player character. We know that in real life, the writers had to keep the details as vague as possible or use the Middle Dawn to keep almost any playthrough consistent with the lore, but is it not possible that this is literally the case within the tes universe also? The details of the CoC's, Nerevarine's, Dragonborn's, etc's life are unstable as they are not bound by prophecy or determinism and thus, unknowable through history. The mages of the College of Winterhold may remember the Dragonborn as a master sorcerer of Altmer descent, while the Companions may remember him as a grizzled Nord warrior, and they may both be correct simultaneously.

We now turn our attention to [Divining of the Elder Scolls [sic]](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Divining_the_Elder_Scolls). 

""[The Elder Scrolls] offer a view of the flux of Time itself."" While the rest of this brief document implies that the future is indeterminate, this quote does not rule out the possibility that the past is behaves similarly. Maybe, only through the reading of an Elder Scroll can one extrapolate a consistent history of the Nerevarine, but that represents only one such reading. However, the Elder Scrolls are variable in many details, but definitive in others. While the player character is free to choose his own fate, he/she is not free to interfere with certain definite events eg the fact that a Dragonborn defeats Alduin.

Now for the Warp in the West. This event could be a world-shattering event that was unique in that it wasn't defined in the Elder Scrolls. Perhaps, the quest of Daggerall was actually meant to be completed by someone with a definite fate. Thus, when the Hero of Daggerfall ended up interfering in it, the two cataclysmic instances of undefined fate collided and caused a hugely unstable history. It was because the implications of this event was so massive that everyone in Tamriel happened to notice it and label it the Dragon Break.

This has worked well for me in the past (the CHIM, Daedric Princes, and dragon episodes were all suggested by listeners) and would like to continue the practice.

So, what do you guys want to hear about?

**UPDATE:** Wow, what an overwhelming response. Thanks everybody for listening and taking an interest. The first episode of the new season will be released in the next few days and, as I said, is all about Akavir. There are a lot of good topics here, just quickly looking over the list it seems like full episodes devoted to each of the nations/cultures of Tamriel would be good (including in-depth information about their respective religions and mythologies and political infrastructure (i.e. the Great Houses of Morrowind)), in addition to an episode about the Divines and maybe an episode all about the Tribunal.

* The Mannimarco you fought wasn't the real Mannimarco, and just a lich impersonating him. This is one of the most popular theories, but it also seems like an easy way out to me. It reminds me of the theories that Alduin (Skyrim) wasn't Lore Alduin, and I have a distaste for those theories.

During this multi-part set of analisations of the various traits and characteristics of the various species of our beautiful continent (which, at time of writing (20th of Sun's Height, 4E3) is on discount at First Edition in the Imperial City), I will take you on journey throughout Tamriel, helping you understand the species inhabiting her.



Before analyzing the exact heritage of each and any intelligent species of Tamriel, both extant and extinct (where enough information is available), it is important to understand the common root they all share (notable exceptions being the Hists and the Argonians of Black Marsh). And to even begin understanding the common root, we need to take a look at the creation of Nirn and Mundus itself.

 According to the legends, Lorkhan envisioned Mundus when looking at the wheel of Aurbis. After convincing some of the Et'Ada to help him create it, they positioned Mundus at the center of said wheel. However, as we all know, Lorkhan was at this point already known as a trickster, and the other Et'Ada quickly lost faith in him. Most of them abondened Mundus, but not all. 

These that remained, known as the Ehlnofey, gave up most of their 'godly' power to stabilize Mundus. Some of them became the earth bones, laws of nature, used to stabilize the physics of Mundus, yet others settled the newly created world of Nirn as mortals, along with the Hist. As in almost all civilisations, not all of them agreed, and those left the homeland of the Ehlnofey, becoming known as the wanderers. 

Eventually, the friction between the Wanderers and the old Ehlnofey sparked a full out war. The exact details of the war are unknown, and we will probably never know the exact form of it. However the results are known to be huge destruction throughout Nirn, shaping most, if not all, of its continents and oceans. The Hist, interestingly, remained neutral in this conflict (as is their nature). Alongside the reshaping of Nirn, the war also finalised the split between the Old Ehlnofey and the Wanderers. According to the myths, the Old Ehlnofey remained on their homeland of (the possible fictional) Aldmeris, becoming the ancestors of the mer (or the elves, as they are more commonly referred to in Cyrodiil), while the wanderers roamed throughout Tamriel, and later settling the other continents, to become the ancestors of men.

*editor's note: the argonians are not mentioned in this list, as they sprout from the Hist, and not the Ehlnofey.*



*(real world) editor's note: I am in not an expert on lore, and not very familiar with the exact origin myths of Mundus (I find those mostly confusing).

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. It's been a great week, and it seems we are about to conclude both the week and the subreddit's wait till we reach the 10,000 subscriber mark. There will not be much to celebrate the occasion in this thread, though you can be sure we do have something planned when we hit the mark. Anyways, I'll just dive right in.

**Weekly Summary**

As I said, another great week. We've seen very outstanding and great amount of activity this week, much in part of the recent influx of newcomers. [B-rad's big Skyrim Civil War Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1cw7ms/the_skyrim_civil_war/) was one of the most active and controversial threads in the subreddit's history, though it was certainly not the only good thread this week. Aside from the threads, we've also seen some more of the community's activity and production outside the subreddit itself, both in [RottenDeadite's awesome reading of The 36 Sermons of Vivec, Sermons 1-12](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1d4guu/the_36_lessons_of_vivec_sermons_112/) and in the apparently successful /r/skyrim AMA that a few scholars have participated in recently. Both the /r/skyrim AMA and the subreddit's general popularity have gained us 190 new scholars this week, putting us right below the 10,000 scholar mark.

 I'd like to, as an aside from the weekly summary itself, welcome all the new scholars to the subreddit. I hope that you all took the time to follow the sidebar's instructions and read the **Rules, [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/faq), and [New Scholar's Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/wiki/newscholarsguide).** If you haven't yet, please do so for the sake of keeping this subreddit a comfortable location for educated and high-quality discussion of the lore.

**Scholar of the Week**

This week we also saw the return of a once very active old timer, whom has returned to us this week to help out in discussions and question threads alike. Thank you, *AeoSC* for your activity this week. You are the only guy in the IRC who's ever actually not AFK, and that never seizes to impress me.

---

That is pretty much all for this week. Do keep watch soon for the 10,000 subscriber gift Rhys has been working so hard on. As always, feel free to discuss, announce, post, or comment on whatever you want in the thread's comments. For all the newcomers who do not know, the Community Threads are the only threads in which most of the subreddit's rules do not apply and content does not have to be lore relevant.

Thank you very much for your activity this week, scholars, and I hope you have a great week!

Alkosh has been, is and always will be; do not let these [profanity removed] tell you any different. Alkosh knew his role would be most tiresome, so he had children to take some of his burdens.

Alkosh first gave birth to brothers, Ahriel and Al'dun. Ahriel would take on Alkosh's necessary burden of history in the beginning and Al'dun would take it and end it in his belly. Alkosh takes on all-time and his sons take some time. This is why he is strong and forever, for he knows how to be forever unlike Ahriel. You imperials sure had your way with him.

Now, Ahriel has been killed and brought back as this monstrosity! [points towards Akatosh on the glass panel]. He is so weak now, but a necessary weak, for you made him take on the inbetween where Ahriel rested and Al'dun awoke. But now look at him! He has been broken so easily and horribly. First you dance on Ahriel's corpse and remake him, then the devils of the east break him and even your sacred emperor-god used the Brass-breaker! You let great Alkosh rest and then force him back into working when you hurt his sons!

Stop letting these liars tell you to praise the undead Ahriel without recognising his mighty father! god of all-time! You say your Talos is many headed, but he is a liar, thief and scum! Now that we talk of Talos, know the emperor had no connection to the *thing* you created. He, like those before him, had been blessed by mighty Alkosh. You think *that* [points at Akatosh again] could bless such men? Fools! Talos is a union of Alkosh blessed and but one form of Lorkhaj the betrayer.

Ahriq tells you now the truth, do not put your faith in this weak lizard, he is but the deformed son of Alkosh the unending! Walk on wiser, Imperials. Your Empire will not be the forever if it does not put its faith in the god of forever, that is why the two before this one failed and why this one will fail too. Do not think the dragon is an eternal form, he will return to himself when brother Al'dun saves him.""

Some pretty big claims for a small cat, but he's saying some interesting things. Who's this ""Al'dun""? All I can think of is the Nordic Alduin, but that's just another name for Akatosh. Interesting fellow, clearly not so intoxicated as I had imagined before, but I don't think he's exactly all there.

*Authors note*: Ahriq was a Khajiit refugee, wanted in Elsweyr for assault, several counts of indecent exposure and ""foolish teachings"". I never understood that last part if this is what the cats believe. He became a good friend in the short time I knew him. He was killed 2 weeks after his speech on the chapel of Akatosh. Most oddly, he was cut many times, but not with a sword or axe wound like I've seen before. Regardless, this is all that's left of Ahriq now.

Khajiit has seen more than most. Rasha has learned Tamrielic to tell you these things, but may not write them for understand.

Rasha has heard great Alkosh roar. It is louder than what any could imagine, but it gives Khajiit strength and speed and spirit. It was so many moons ago Rasha could not even tell you the date this happened, but Alkosh roared out to Khajiit for Alkosh knew Khajiit were faithful. It took Khajiit only 3 days to reach where Alkosh had guided us, we ran so fast those days without even a grain of moon sugar in rest. Alkosh had told Khajiit to travel far out of Elsweyr and towards the red mountain where we would meet the mighty warriors from cold sands.

Rasha was so shocked when he came to the red mountain base and met the Nords. Alkosh had roared us towards red mountain and Rasha sees Lorkhaj of all things! Why would Alkosh work with Lorkhaj? It was troublesome but Rasha understood that even they must join to stop the foolish golden devils.

Rasha was worried again for what he would have to do. Rasha is but Suthay and these Nords were big, so Rasha stayed with his friend, Zira, and Rasha found comfort in his presence. Perhaps the most interesting was the Nord Ra'Wulfarth, whom tried to shout like Alkosh had roared. He was nothing against Alkosh, but he proved his strength and Khajiit respected it.

That battle was gruesome, but Khajiit fought on. It was most wise, what Ra'Wulfarth planned, as most big Nords with Khajiit fought the main forces of golden devils bot above ground and in the deep but the Ra'Wulfarth, some of his men and the Rhojiit rode up the Red Mountain to strike at the most powerful of devils.

This is where Rasha was lucky, he hid with his friend Zira who was part of the Rhojiit and did not have to face the devils head on. But when Ra'Wulfarth rode Zira with the other larger Rhojiit, Rasha had to climb by himself. It was a long and hard climb, but Rasha found it easier than the stranded Nords who wanted to follow Ra'Wulfarth. When Rasha finally reached the top, he saw the devils numbered 6 and Ra'Wulfarth fighting some of them. It was most interesting, Rasha looked upon one in the robes and recognized him as Mage; Khajiit believes he heard him referred to as ""S'tha"". Rasha respects S'tha for that devil was powerful with magic yet did not use it against Khajiit, it was duty that brought both of us there.

Dumalacath had taken a sword to Ra'Wulfarth's neck when it had appeared to end, until Zira pounced atop Dumalacath and ripped at his golden armour. The devil-Orc was lucky, had it been a lighter armour he would surely be dead. But as the Ra'Wulfarth had fought on he had been knocked aback and down the mountain peak by the devil ""Nerevar"" and Zira blasted back from the devil ""Vek"" who had powerful magic. Rasha went to join Zira as we knew that we must flee and had done so. As we continued down the ash Zira told many other Rhojiit to join Ra'Wulfarth at the peak, many did so. A most strange thing happened after that, as Zira and Rasha looked upon Ra'Wulfrth in the distance he had shouted to Jone and Jode themselves and moved them! What happened next Rasha will never forget.

Each and every Rhojiit who was not Senche had transformed into Senche and fought in a frenzy above the Red Mountain, some even taking claw to Ra'Wulfarth. As Rasha walked down with Zira, applying healing magic to his wounds, we both looked at Ra'Wulfarth who had been blasted into ash and blown down to the west. The insane Rhojiit had followed the ashes into the land where they were placed by wind, the Nordic home Skyrim.

2 days later on that awful island Zira and Rasha found ourselves in front of Sheggorath. He looked at us and showed anger, for Zira had escaped the fate of the other Rhojiit. Rasha knows Sheggorath is powerful, so to save Zira Rasha ran up to the mad child and stole his staff. Surely a child of Fadomai would have a staff for destruction, so knowing the silly god's traits it had to have been a healing staff.

It wasn't. Khajiit used the staff on Zira and he became a chicken.

The mad child laughed and laughed, he appreciated my attempt. In his greedy humour Sheggorath cast both Rasha and Zira into his lands. What a land. It was as if architected to Khajiit standards but lacking proper directions like smells and changes. Oh and the skooma. Sometimes it was nowhere to be found, other times it was EVERYWHERE. Rasha snuck past Sheggorath once and found he wore clothes of Skooma even.

Zira was most lucky though. Lorkhaj had entered the mad lands and taken Zira back for his bravery, but not Rasha. Lorkhaj looked much like Ra'Wulfarth this time though, but perhaps it was the mad lands which changed our view of him. It had been so troublesome, the thought of staying there forever, but Alkosh had come not long after and brought Rasha back right where Zira was in Elsweyr. This is where Rasha learned it is most important to forgive, for even though Lorkhaj had acted so terribly to his brothers and sisters, he still aided Khajiit and worked with Alkosh.

Rasha has not aged since that day. Rasha does not know why, Zira has been long dead.

Rimmen made things worse for Rasha. Rasha never goes to Rimmen anymore. The town is fine, but nothing good comes from going there. Do you men or mer know what happened? Perhaps not, the Empire liked to keep many truths; do not trust that Empire, they are thieves greater than Rajhin. Only the Empire steals truth.

Now, Rimmen. When Rasha was leaving Rimmen the sands were so pleasantly warm. Strolling them was falling for a lie, thinking this would harbour a good day. It did not. For a great hall was found where Khajiit had strolled. It was not of Khajiiti design at all, looking so... Big. Did the Nords build it? Impossible, we are too south for that. Was it the deep devils? It lacked their common features. Perhaps even a child of Fadomai's? But then who? Rasha cannot tell you, nobody knows who built that place. But the Empire found interest in it. At least, Rasha saw imperials and their uniforms there, it had to be them. Rasha will not bore you with petty details, but Rasha discovered another powerful Mage there.

""Su'rin"" Rasha thinks. It was hard to hear. But words are not what Rasha was amazed by. It was Big Walker.

The Empire must have stolen again, who would give up Big Walker? Before his death, Zira spoke of the Big Walker that was meant to have taken every deep devil away. That's a powerful weapon to hold and Rasha has seen it with his own eyes. It gets worse, too.

If Rasha tells you in this book ""Rasha is not sick"" it is a lie. No cat or man or elf would ever be ok after what happened. After Rasha had left the great halls, Su'rin must have woken Big Walker for there is nothing that could have cursed the sands like that. Now the rocks and the sand glow with stinging magic. Many have died walking through, Rasha does not understand why he still lives. You look at Rasha, you see Suthay. You look at glow-rocks, you will see the skulls and bones of many who tried to walk through and died. Rasha has met some who tried to walk through, they came back as though they dragged their tongues in fields of skooma. And the vomiting, Khajiit does not want to speak of the vomiting.

You may ask Rasha ""why give these words""? Rasha has no answer, the words are important. Rasha knows this. Why they are important is different. Will they teach others to stop trusting the empire? Will men and mer finally realise Khajiit's role on the Red Mountain? Will this warn others to never birth the Big Walker again? We shall wait and see, Rasha won't be getting any older.

For now, may your road lead you to warm sands, perhaps you will see Rasha. If you do, speak of knowledge and wisdom, Rasha has lived long enough to hear all the boring tales, it is refreshing to hear good words.

To see the difference: [Original Version](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/106hb1/imperial_report_on_the_origin_of_the_sload/).

And now, for the main course...

*Imperial Report on the Origin of the Sload, by Scholar Flavius Lupus*

Greetings to all who may read this. I am scholar Flavius Lupus of the Synod, expert on the origins and mythologies of the many races who inhabit our world. It is one of the other, disconnected kingdoms of which I mean to speak, however. Those of you who have studied the plagues that have stricken our great Empire, such as the Knahaten Flu, will probably be familiar with the Thrassian Plague, the devastating disease that led to the eventual destruction of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, home of the Sload, by the All Flags Navy. I was granted special audience with a member of the Psijic Order recently who told me the story of the Sload creation myth, the ""K'Grua"" as they call it. It takes places during the Ehlnofex Wars, before the Men and Mer as we know them today came to be. It goes like this:
_____________________________________________________________________
During a battle between the Ehlnofex armies, the Champion Trinimac paused from his rampage as he felt a strange and powerful magic being woven throughout his forces. He looked over the battlefield, and his eyes fell upon a Necromancer, N'Gyre, as he called himself, and he watched briefly as N'Gyre began to raise up the broken bodies of his comrades.

At this “most foul of injustices”, Trinimac flew into a rage, approaching the Necromancer saying, ""Look at this, what atrocities you have committed! All this evil done with impunity, and a clear conscience on your part! You should bear the shame of a thousand betraying soldiers, for you fight not only through the use of others' power, but with the power of your own comrades!""

Hearing the rebuke, N'Gyre said, offended, ""Trinimac, you may be the Champion God of Lord Auri-El, but when you have passed your usefulness and begin to wither, there shall I stand, ready to rekindle the flame of your passion, but with my own choice fuel, that I may be your mind and body's master, and you will serve me on bended knee.""
Trinimac, growing ever more angered, pleaded with Auri-El for the permission to slay N'Gyre, but it was not yet allowed. Trinimac first attempted to slay the Necromancer with brute force, charging from behind him and, with a great swing of his blade, chopping through N’Gyre’s body. The body exploded into ash, and behind Trinimac stood N’Gyre, grinning with content. With the most sly of looks coming over his face, N’Gyre said, “Oh, Trinimac, you hypocrite.” Growing more angry than clever now, N’Gyre continued, “What was that you said about me being a traitor? You should listen to your master before you act too rashly.” Trinimac bellowed, “How dare you, you worm! I will take pleasure in burying by blade in your corpse!”

Yet again, Trinimac went and plead with his master, Auri-El, but again was not given permission to kill N’Gyre. He tried his same tactic again, but with some underlying cunning, having a powerful mage cast a decoy spell similar to N’Gyre’s while Trinimac crept up behind the Necromancer. But N’Gyre, wise in the ways of life magics, disregarded the intangible decoy and evaded Trinimac’s attack yet again. Clearly upset by this repeated treachery, N’Gyre turned and approached Trinimac, saying, “You, Trinimac are a fool. You misunderstand the beauty of my work, the way in which I venerate the bodies of my comrades by giving them the power and strength to fight again. You call it foul and wretched, but yet you sneak up on me and try to trick me, so that you can betray me, your comrade? What honor or pride is in that?”

Trinimac, outraged at the way in which N’Gyre tried to justify himself and his actions, yet again pleaded with Auri-El, saying, “Master, he has corrupted the souls and bodies of our most brave forces, yet he claims to be venerating them, restoring them, and he insults me, as well!”
Auri-El, looking on Trinimac annoyedly, said, “Trinimac, my Strong-Arm, do as you see fit to the necromancer N’Gyre, if only so that your pestering will be ceased. Truly, he is powerful, and he serves our forces well, but you are surely not the only one who thinks likewise of his actions. It pains me that we will lose such a powerful mage, but it must be so.” At his word, Trinimac went, with his blade held firmly, to bring the cold grip of death to the necromancer at last.

 Swift and clever as N’Gyre was, Trinimac, this time, had outwitted him. Trinimac had all of his anger and ferocity in his attack, and his brute strength finally took the mage by surprise. Trinimac, with a final, powerful swing of his blade, brought what he called “justice” to N’Gyre, and cut him into pieces, which he proceeded to cast into the Western Sea. The Necromancer’s undead warriors dissolved into ash, and a strange purple emission rose up from each of the ash piles, spiraling into the air until finally descending into the ocean, seeking to return home. Trinimac, satisfied with his revenge, withdrew from the place, going to prepare for another battle.

After Trinimac had departed, the foam from the sea and the sludge from N'Gyre's corpse mingled, and from this coagulation of mixtures, a proud, clever race was born, the Sload. The pieces of N'Gyre that were too small to sink became the islands of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, and the energy of N'Gyre and his final spell lingered on, infusing necromantic power in each of us from birth.

_____________________________________________________________________

The Psijic monk continued with his own information, which was as follows: ""They worship only N'Gyre, but are known to make pacts and deals with Daedra Princes and other supernatural beings, like Namira, Mistress of the Grotesque, Peryite, the Father of Disease, and the K’Gar Nam’k, the Masters of Souls, always with the intent of furthering their own potential as a means to an end, an end which is a well kept secret among them and their leaders. I do not know of this secret, but perhaps another does.""

I tell you this, fellow scholars, as it was told to Erondil of Firsthold, PSJJJJ, who told it to me, Flavius Lupus, Scholar of the Synod and Mythological Expert.

May your studies progress ever onward,

Flavius Lupus, Synod Researcher

Translation is rough, but not terribly hard.*

---

Old King Borgas had a dream, a dream in Winterhold he dreamed. He dreamed a great Dragon flew down to where he stood, a Dragon fierce of Tongue and black of wing. It Spoke. ""Ho ha ho! O Borgas-King, ruler of the little land-that-was-once-my-kin's, why are you abed? You must away, away to crush the little not-men who live in the deep woods that lie beyond your Alessia's jungled realm! For they are the last threat to the Order you swore to support, and once they are gone, there will be peace, and your kin shall rule all of this land!""

So King Borgas rose from his bed, and prepared for war. He marched south, past the great hill where sat Jorrvaskr, home of the great Companions of Ysgramor, Borgas' kin-father. Borgas supped with the noble warriors who dwelt there, and arose the next morning, intent on crossing the Great Mountains down into the jungled south. But before he could leave, a Man, fair of hair, but worn and haggard, ran up to him.

He Spoke: ""Borgas, King of Skyrim, do not pursue this foolishness! For as I am, you shall be worse! Stay, do not invoke the wrath of these Elves, for you will be Hunted down and ended! Heed my words!""

But Borgas thought of the words of the Dragon, and said ""Ho ha ho! Who are you to question my will? If I shall go South, as I will, it is not I who shall be Hunted, but the Elf-kin who make trouble for the Cyrodiils in their land! Stand aside, you wretched villain, or I'll have you strung up by your legs and kept imprisoned!"" And the King and his army rode on.

They reached the pass southward, the way through the Mountains. There, they were met by a she-Wolf. She too Spoke, with the voice of a maiden fair. ""O Borgas, King of these people, do not go south! Only death awaits you and your kin! You will be Hunted to the ends of this world, and not one of your line will survive it! Take pity on the lives of your kin and return to the snow-bound palace of your fathers!""

But Borgas again thought of the words of the Dragon, and scorned the she-Wolf. He said ""Ho ha ho! Who are you, fool Wolf, to question a king of men? For I am a Tongue, strong and proud! I am of the line of Ysgramor, and I shall not fail! Away from me, I say, away! Leave us be, or I shall wear your fur as a cloak!"" And the King and his army rode on.

They reached the great Tower White-Gold, where there others of the Order of Alessia were gathered. King Borgas told them of his plan, and of his dream of the mighty Dragon, and they agreed that it was a sign of his divinely-given victory. They stayed in the City there for a fortnight, and set out for the borders of the jungled land of Cyrodiil. As they stepped out of the jungles, an old Fox, fur streaked with silver, called out to the King. He spoke. ""Borgas! King over men from distant lands! Turn back, for the Hunt shall soon be upon you! Leave while you and your line still may, for I tell you, the forests of Valenwood will be your doom. Your land will be torn asunder! Turn back, you Fool-hearted King, turn back!""

But Borgas again thought of the words of the Dragon, and scorned the Fox. He said ""Ho ha ho! Who are you, cowardly little Fox, to speak to me of fate? For I am fated to crush these tree-dwelling Elves beneath my boots, and your portents of doom will not dissuade me! Away from me, I say, away!""

But the Fox Spoke again. ""You have made your choice then. Fool-King Borgas, and by my whiskers, your lands shall be rent by War. Your heirs will be struck down, and the line of Ysgramor shall be Hunted down to the last, even to the bastards hidden from all knowledge. The land is rent from you, and your people shall go their own way. But you, fool that you are, shall not enter into My realm. You may keep your crown of power for a time, till one more worthy than you takes it again. Go now to your doom."" And the Fox ran up, and bit the King.

Borgas drew a knife and killed the Fox. His men quaked with fear, but he roused them with strong Voice, and they went onward. 

But the words of the Fox were a dire foretelling, for the Elves of Valenwood they did not find. Instead, a horde of beasts, beasts more fearsome and terrible than any could imagine, charged out at the King and his army from the forests. Borgas was struck down, and he breathed his last under the boughs of a mighty oak tree. His generals ordered a retreat, and his body was rushed off of the field. 

The dead were many, for the Wild Hunt of the Bosmer spared none, and only those quick enough to escape did so. All the King's sons fell in that terrible rout, and the King was quickly buried in a grand tomb he had prepared for himself. Fearing the words of the Fox, the men left the Jagged Crown of Ysgramor's line with him, his eternal keepsake.

Could it be that Direnni are already a group of degenerate elves who already have mixed up with men? But not enough to loose most of the elven traits, such as magickal ability and longevity?

We know bretons have elven ancestry, so somewhere along the past there must have been a group of elves who mixed with men. Maybe from that event originated both Bretons and the Elves of Direnni.
I imagine a long time ago, when the altmer arived in high rock they could be considered altmer, but the direnni clan for too long has followed a diffetent path. A path where they cannot be considered the same as their cousins back in summerset.

Looking at the list below let's take the name ""Valie"", take each letter and plug it into the number list below. V=400, A= 1, L= 30, so on, and add it together. Her number ends up being 445.

I don't *think* we know why this is, but this is my personal theory on this phenomena.

Magicka comes from the portals to Aetherius, or Magnus and the stars. When a mage uses the magicka for magic, he takes the magicka into his own body to shape it into different forms. Now, the residue from the unused magicka is what causes the lifespan increase, because Aetherius is the *immortal* plane. Everything that belongs in Aetherius cannot die. and magicka as energy from Aetherius. So when a mage casts a spell, he is taking bits of that 'immortal energy' called magicka into himself. When you have the key to immortality within your body, you tend to last a bit longer, but not as long as those living in Aetherius. They live forever, because the air in Aetherius is (probably) teeming with magicka, giving them a constant supply of magicka, even if they don't want it.

I was sitting in my classroom today thinking about Lycanthropy and wondering kind of the limits and control one has over their inner werewolves. 

In Morrowind's expansion, bloodmoon, when the Neravarine contracts lycanthropy from a werewolf, (s)he is forced to turn into one at night and must quench the bloodlust or face taking some serious damage from, albeit, starvation. In Skyrim, during the quest ""Ill met by Moonlight"", Sinding mentions having no control over the transformations as they are sporadic, or turn up when predator instincts are enticed. Also in Skyrim, quenching bloodlust is what keeps the werewolf abilities going.

My question is a little bit complicated and goes a little more complex:

* How much control does a normal being have over their werewolf abilities

* Is the transformations strickly night time or are they provocative (maybe random)?

* Can a being starve to death if the bloodlust is not pleased (like in bloodmoon)

Now this next question goes a little above and beyond what I'm asking, and might force in some conjecture. It also only applies really if a person can starve to death from lycanthropy. Nevertheless, its an interesting situation I came up with and was wondering what you guys think.

Lets say there is a situation where two best buds are going to a cavern and full of ruthless bandits. Friend number one is a normal breton, Friend number two is a nord with lycanthropy. The breton has been aware of his buddy's lycanthropy for a while and is usually cautious to avoid it/help him out. For a while the nord has been unsuccessful in getting a taste of some man/mer. He is starving, so his breton buddy brings him to the cavern to eat the bandits. They enter the cavern only to be met with a collapsing mine. Ice covers the entrance and the both of them will not be able to thaw the ice until a day or so of trying. There are no bandits to be found and the nord feels his werewolf coming out. The breton might be able to cast a calm spell on him when he turns, but he fears that his friend will die after this transformation. Could the breton cut his hand with a kife (little slit) and feed the blood to the werewolf and feed his friend just enough to make it out and search for more prey? Or is this friendship screwed over after dinner? Would like to hear everyone's thoughts

However, as someone who's interest lies almost solely in the lore, I've always thought that I wouldn't mind canon protagonists - actually, I'd love it. I want to know who the heroes were, what they did, where they were from. I want to know their *name*. Why? Because such ambiguity completely blocks uncharted spaces of lore that we can never know. The heroes are among the most important figures in Tamriel's history, among people like Talos and Vehk, who would be given just as much lore to themselves as them.

[This post](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/yscdt/sneaky_marketing_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/) in /r/truegaming discusses how Skyrim, unlike previous TES games, essentially has a canon hero due to how the game was marketed. Indeed, when I first played Skyrim's MQ, I made my Dovahkiin look like the Skyrim mascot - and not completely consciously. It just felt right that way. I've tried playing different Dovahkiins since, but it doesn't feel right, because they don't look like the mascot. And I have no objection to it - I can play something that's pretty close to *the* Dovahkiin. He has an image. He just needs a name and a story.

[Star Wars (Old Republic era) spoilers:](/s "" An example of what I'm talking about is Revan. KotOR has been one of my favorite games since I was a kid, and Revan always enthralled me. He was such a badass, and I wanted to know more about him. Content was eventually released about him, but there was always an inevitable and looming feeling over it that didn't let you forget that they couldn't tell you much more; his face always left in darkness by the hood he never lowered. Since then, however, he's appeared in the flesh in SWtOR, with a face and a voice. He'd been unveiled - a novel was written about him, because he'd become a character rather than just a protagonist, and those aspects of Star Wars lore could be accessed. It felt right - Revan is one of the biggest figures in Star Wars history, and it made no sense to pretend otherwise."")

People have shown equal enthusiasm for creating music, game, and novel, so I've decided to create a subreddit for each medium.

/r/tesloremod

I did not create a tesloregame, as I felt that a standalone game was too ambitious and unrealistic. If you disagree, feel free to create another subreddit.

Please comment or PM me if you are interested in heading any of the three projects so that I can assign moderators for each subreddit. I am planning on stepping down from tesloremod and tesloremusic, so you don't have to worry about me becoming a tyrannical asshole. Check out the official discussion thread on each sub to discuss the specifics of the project in-depth. Please contribute your ideas and let's get this going!

And while I have the podium, I also had the idea of sharing the projects' progress on this subreddit once a month, if that would be fine by the moderators and the community.

- Return to the tribal clan system
- Return to ancestor/Daedra worship
- Rejection of the Imperial Treaty and withdrawal from the Empire
- Removal of all Outlanders (non-Dunmer) from Morrowind.

- Return to complete rule by High King
- Return to Talos worship/rejection of White-Gold Concordat

It is also very long, with no adequate TL;DR. Most of the contents are pure speculation, with little to no actual evidence backed up by official lore.

The text is in two parts: the first considers the personality and character of Dovahkiin in Skyrim, the other focuses on the consept of Dragonborn itself.

**Of the Personality of Dovahkiin:**


The most common thought seems to be considering Dovahkiin as a brutal Nord. There is strong evidence to back Dovahkiin as a male, Nord, and a sword-user, especially due to the game advertisements. For this reason, I shall refer to Dovahkiin as male. However, there is no evidence that Dovahkiin is in any way ""dumb"" or ""savage."" When the events leading to the downfall of Alduin are taken into account, there is no reason to consider his intelligence as below-average.

During the main quest in Skyrim the Dragonborn is forced to:

- Infiltrate an embassy, fulled with Thalmor spies

- Talk over Esbern, an old Blade with good reason to not trust anyone

- Gain entrance to the College of Winterhold (I know that demonstrating a shout will do, but anyway)

- Be able to learn about Kel, and be intelligent enough to actually find one

- Navigate through difficult political negotiations where *both sides hate each other*

- Device a careful trap to fool a Dov

- Solve countless puzzles in extremely hostile circumstances

A valid counter-argument is that the Dovahkiin gains a great deal of help from those wiser than him, but the point lies just there: *He is intelligent enough to listen what others have to say. He knows that his knowledge is limited.* In my personal opinion, this is the greatest show of wisdom there is.

Other reason to defend Dovahkiin is that we shouldn´t let stereotypes rule. Quoting from [Words and Philosophy:](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Words_and_Philosophy)

&gt; ""The archetype of the idiot fighter is as solidly ingrained as that of the brilliant wizard and the shrewd thief, but it was not always so. The figure of the philosopher swordsman, the blade-wielding artist are creatures of the past, together with the swordsinger of the Redguards, who was said to be able to create and wield a blade with but the power of his mind. The future of the intelligent blade-wielder looks bleak in comparison to the glories of the past.""

The reason Dovahkiin wields a blade does not make him a brute, and being a Nord does not make him an idiot. For every Ulfric Stormcloak and Galmar Stone-Fist there are Brunwulf Free-Winter and Balgruuf the Greater. To believe someone is racist because of his race is in itself racist.

Dovahkiin can in short time achieve pretty much anything. He can save the world as we know it, although

&gt; ""Perhaps those who seek to hasten the end shall delay it"" -Paarthurnax

Dragonborn may become the Arch-Mage, the Harbinger, the Listener and the Guildmaster for the Thieves Guild. He can interact directly with Daedra and survive. Because his potential is limitless, there is no point in downplaying him as anything less than a Hero. Of course, it depends on the backstory of all Dovahkiin, but lorewise there is no basis to claim him stupid.


**Being Dragonborn**


In Tamriel, the names and descriptions of Dragonborn are plenty. [The St. Alessia and the Reman and Septim Emperors are referred as Dragonborn Emperors.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dovahkiin) Dragonborn is being referred as ""Born with the soul and blood of a dragon."" On the following I assume the Dragon Blood and Soul to be independent from each other, and the term Dragonborn is being used in lore to describe having soul and/or the blood of a dragon.

Let us start with Alessia. She is credited with having the blood and soul of a dragon. This makes her inevitably Dovahkiin. From her covenant with Akatosh was created the Amulet of Kings, which can only be worn by those with ""dragon blood."" Differentiating factor between these is that I consider the ""Dragon Blood"" (Dovah Sos) be hereditary, when the ""Dragon Soul"" (Dovah Sil) would be something only gained as a result of divine interference or of reasons discussed later.

After someone has gained Dragon Soul they are able to avoid death. When such a person dies, their immortal Dragon Soul escapes and is able to *return back in time to a predetermined location and learn from their mistakes.* Process is only stopped when faced with someone other with Dragon Soul. In this case, the soul of Dovahkiin manages to escape so fast that other Dov can not devour their souls.

The Dragon Blood is in itself a special entity, independent from Dragon Soul. I consider it as a “soul gem” of sorts, big enough to capture Dragon Souls. Dragon Blood would be what allows one to wear the Amulet of Kings, if we consider the Amulet as containing some of the divine essence of Akatosh, and only the Dragon Blood can store that essence so one can wear it. In addition, the Dragon Soul would prevent the soul of a dead dragon from escaping and force it to the Dragon Blood a “soul trap” for dragons, if you like.

This differentiation nicely explains why CoC was unable to wear the Amulet of Kings but be able to fool death: he had the Soul of the Dragon, but not the Blood. Martin, on the other hand, could not fool death, but was able to wear the Amulet – he had the Blood but not the Soul.

In Dovahkiin these two independent concepts come together in a unique way: there is a person who can devour Dragon Souls and fool death. But why all of this? Why is it necessary to even consider these? Reason is simple. The Dragon Soul is directly related to CHIM.

Let us review those who we know for certain have been Dragonborn: St. Alessia. [Sainted.]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alessia) Reman Cyrodiil. [Considered divine.]( http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reman_Cyrodiil#Reman) Tiber Septim. Talos. All of these have been divinized. Let us widen the range to those with the ability to fool death (and if the assumptions are correct, have the Dragon Soul): Talin, CHIM. The Agent, CHIM. Cyrus, CHIM. Nerevarine, CHIM. Champion of Cyrodiil, CHIM. Dovahkiin, CHIM. Vivec, CHIM.

There is no contradiction between immortality by Dragon Soul and the list above, because of the ability of Dragon Soul to prevent the escape of other Dragon Souls. Therefore, Nerevarine could kill Vivec or vice versa and CoC would kill Mankar Camoran (discussed later). The permanence of this death would be arguable.

Back to the point. The Dragon Soul in itself would not grant CHIM; it would be necessary but not adequate in order to achieve CHIM. That is why the Dov have not done it; the concepts related to CHIM are outside of their scope of understanding, much like the concept of mortality. This gives some background to theories (I just made up) that as Vivec turned upon the Heart of Lorkhan, it gave him the Soul of a Dragon, that Nerevarine gained it from Azura and CoC from Akatosh when he received the Amulet of Kings from the Emperor and chose to act to defend Tamriel, despite his own safety.

Necessary result from this is that the association of Dragon Soul and Akatosh is greatly overestimated, and can be gained many ways. As Akatosh is the father of Dragons, who are all born with these properties it is easy to see how this understanding could emerge. Relation between CHIM and Dovah Sil is that when someone begins to understand parts of CHIM, he gradually gains the ability to manipulate time (another Akatosh - connection), and gains understanding of his surroundings faster than those around him. This is commonly referred as having Dragon Soul. The Dov are immortal, and not bound by time, so this explanation suits them as well.

To return to the Dovahkiin of Skyrim: 

&gt; ""The World-Eater wakes, and the Wheel turns upon the Last Dragonborn."" -The Prophecy of the Dragonborn

I see the Last Dragonborn here meaning the last of those with both Dragon Blood and Soul. In that case, the offspring(?) of Dovahkiin would necessary have the Dragon Blood (hereditary) but not the Dragon Soul. One way to test this hypothesis would be with the Amulet of Kings. Having reviewed the confrontation between Martin Septim and Mehrunes Dagon, it is unclear whether the Amulet actually broke or just disappeared. No shatters were visible, although the giant statue hindered the view somewhat. It is of divine essence, so it could just return in time to somewhere it had already been, just waiting for the new Dragonborn Emperor.

Mankar Camoran has to be considered here, as he was able to wear the Amulet of Kings, and having *achieved* CHIM. Assuming he was born a normal Altmer (a new reason for hate them), he would have necessary gained the Dragon Soul. Somehow he also ended up gaining the Dragon Blood in the process, or then we assume he was born with the Blood. Other option is that his Paradise was somehow disconnected from Mundus in such a way that the Amulet was lacking in power, or simply that Mankar chose to levitate the Amulet in front of his throat just to look flashy. There was no time to conduct quality experimentation because he killed my CoC around 64 times before laid to rest (note to myself: when level 5 and going against high-level caster, **bring silence poisons**).

Perhaps the most important trend so far with individual relation to Dovahkiin is that every person credibly with both the Soul and Blood of the Dragon, a.k.a. Dovahkiin in traditional sense, has begun his/her own dynasty as the Emperor.

Edit: Seems I have been mistaken on the account of Mankar Camoran, and he did not achieve CHIM. The point still stands that he had some way of wearing the Amulet. Also, he had some knowledge of CHIM, which can lead to him having some greater knowledge.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,True,,,True,t3_rmnx2,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/rmnx2/thoughts_of_dovahkiin/,

This part will deal with the elves that inhabit the woodlands of Valenwood, the Bosmer. Even though Bosmeri culture has long been shrouded in obscurity, in recent years some scholars have documented vast amounts of information about these elves, and I would like to redirect the interested reader to [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17i9cl/the_boiche_a_treatise_on_the_elves_of_valenwood/) two [works](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/18jmat/the_boiche_a_treatise_on_the_elves_of_valenwood/). However, for the completeness of 'On the Species of Tamriel', I will still include this.*



The bosmer, in the Elven language meaning 'wood people' (or as they call themselves: Boiche, 'tree-sap people', as their name in their own tongue means), in Cyrodiil better known as the Woodelves, are a race of mer from the forested province of Valenwood, on the southern shore of Tamriel. They are a curious people, regarded as some of the best archers around, albeit lazy ones.

The biology of the Woodelves is significantly different from that of other Elves. Even though they share the affinity for magic, the pointed ears and the longevity of the other merkinds, they are stouter than their more elegant brethern. This is most apparent in the male Bosmer, which is shorter than the female and the rest of the Tamrielic species (not counting the Alfiq Khajiit subspecies). This short and somewhat plump build helps them greatly in navigating the dense forests of their homeland. Because of their lifestyle (which in some circles is described as rudimentary), they have developed a resistance to most diseases. Alongside this, they have the ability to control more simple minded creatures, of which there is plenty in Valenwood. Lastly the elves of Valenwood hold a darker power of which they don't like talking, called 'the Wild Hunt', which will be explained later.

There are some sources on the origin of the Bosmer. The Altmer hold that, most likely because of their very open and tolerant culture, the Elves took 'mannish wives'. It is highly plausible that the early Aldmeri settlers had human wives, which would explain their shorter and compacter build. However, the Bosmer themselves hold a different theory, which might not be as farfetched as it seems at first sight.

The Bosmer believe they descend from Aldmer who were blessed with something called 'the Green Pact'. This pact, made with Y'ffre (in some accounts a collective name for the Earth Bones, in others one of the Earth Bones), made the Bosmer the keepers of the forest, and shaped them to better suit the wood life. According to this pact, the Bosmer are not aloud to harm any form of flora, and as such are required to feed and build solely with animal materials (they have been lenient with this rule, as imported wood and other plant material is allowed). A disturbing side affect of this, is that Bosmer are obliged to eat their fallen foes, both animal and sentient, including other Bosmer. In case of a sentient death, only the family of the slayer is allowed to help (the definition of family might be broader in Bosmeri culture. It might denote everything from immediate family to the entire species). It is important to note that the Green Pact is only in effect in Valenwood; Bosmer are allowed to cut trees outside of Valenwood, and they use imported materials for their housing.

The Bosmeri culture is noted for being one of the most tolerant (although this has waned in the wake of the reestablishment of the Aldmeri Dominion). Bosmer readily except other races, from inside and outside of Valenwood, outcast or king. It is plausible this tolerance and openness led to interbreeding between mer and men, possibly resulting in the Bosmer appearance (that is, if the Y'ffre theory appears to be false). This also made them the target of despise by their Altmeri cousins, who view men as evil.  
This tolerance has also led to some of the more interesting pantheons on Tamriel. Alongside some of the more typical Aldmeri deities, the Bosmer also venerate the Cyrodillian god Arkay, the Kothringi god Z'en, an aspect of the god Zenithar, whose power is now toil and payment in kind, and Herma-Mora takes the same role he has in Nordic religion. They also venerate some gods, like the Moon Gods, like the Khajiit do, their ancient rivals. Alongside these gods of mixed heritage, they have one god that is unique to their pantheon, namely Y'ffre. Alongside his role as maker of the Green Pact (as noted above), he was also the god that, in the days of the Dawn Era, taught the creatures their final form. Before this point (before time flowed linear), the creatures took every form, possible and impossible, all at the same time. After fixing all shapes and forms, he gave the Bosmer the knowledge of their old form, and the ritual required to regain it. Bosmer taking this form is called the 'Wild Hunt'. The Woodelves performing this ritual will transform in dark beasts, blinded by fury, and will devour their enemies. Because it is a final transformation, the hunters will devour each other until one remains, who will flee into the wild. Bosmer don't like talking about it, and only resort to it as an act of desperation.  
Because of the knowledge Y'ffre gave the Bosmer, he is often referred to as 'the Storyteller'. Because of this title and the respect the Bosmer hold for this god, they are fabled bards and poets. This and their often upbeat nature make them a popular sight at festivals.

Bosmer society divides the Bosmer in multiple clans and families. The clans have almost never been united, and often the pride of unity vanishes after a few years. Because of these small communities, the Bosmer know little solidarity. In the rest of the continent they are seen as lazy, since some of them rarely to anything productive. Alongside this, Bosmeri troops are infamous for low discipline and deserting at the littlest sign of threat. Even though these traits are common in Valenwood, outside of their home province, they seem to easily adapt. It is not uncommon to meet them around Tamriel as traders, shopkeepers and fletchers.

The Bosmer are noteworthy archers. their fletch work is famous around Tamriel for being the best there is; their skills are so well known, it is even rumoured that fletching originated in Valenwood. Since the Green Pact prohibits Wood elves using any wood, most bows are made of chitin or bone.

Bosmeri culture dates back to the very start of the first era, when the legendary king Eplear united his kin.  
During the first era, the Bosmer had numerous skirmishes with the upcoming Alessian empire. These were quickly ended with a Wild Hunt, killing then emperor Borgas. The empire divided the Bosmer after this by giving all city states independence. This broke up the unity they had, which resulted in a last resort treaty with the Altmer of the Summerset Isles to create the Aldmeri Dominion. Hundreds of years later, Valenwood was, like all other provinces, annexed by the empire, of which it remained part until the Thalmor seized it. The institution of Thalmor rule saw the decline of the openness so striking for Bosmeri culture.

*This concludes the summary on the Bosmer of Valenwood. These elves are one of the strangest kinds on Tamriel. Both lazy and brilliant, their mastery of fletching and archery is truly one of the most wonderful on the whole continent.*

*DISCLAIMER: neither the author nor the publisher in any way condone any racist or supremacist stance towards the above mentioned race.

This will be the first which deals with species still alive, in this case the Altmer.*


The Altmer (meaning ""old"" or ""high/noble people"" in their own tongue), or High Elves, as they are primarily known outside of the elven provinces (in this case, ""high"" doesn't necessarily denote noble or civilized, and is mostly used to refer to the arrogant and snobby attitude that some of them express towards the other races of Tamriel), are a tall and gold-skinned race of elves from the Summerset Isles. They are considered to be the most like the common elven ancestor, the Aldmer (see volume II for notes on this). They are well known for their incredible expertise with magic and their art, sometimes regarded as the height of culture.

The Altmer are easily distinguishable, even for the untrained eye, as they are easily the tallest people in Tamriel, surpassing even the Nords of Skyrim, towering over the other races, and having a yellow/golden skin colour. Along these remarkable traits, they also share the more common elven traits, namely pointed ears, a slender build, a respectable longevity, and a very strong affinity towards magicka. This affinity is, however, so strong, that they not only are better spell casters and mages, but are also more vulnerable to it. An other interesting characteristic is that, even though they keep their gene pool small on purpose (to appear more like their ancestors), they still have a heightened resistance to most diseases.

Historically, the Altmer have long resented the Empire, as they see the other races as inferior, and find themselves isolated of the matters of the mainland on their own islands. Even though they did not take part in most of the early conflicts and problems of Tamriel, they weren't completely untroubled. Indeed, the Altmer have more than one time saved Tamriel from invasions (not out of care for the other species, but out of the fact that they were the first target), like the Sloads and the Maormer, along with some internal conflicts. During these wars, the Altmer grew tired of the attacks, and formed an alliance with the Bosmer of Valenwood, called the Aldmeri Dominion. This helped defend the Summerset Isles, but could not stand against the armies of Tiber Septim. In 2E 896, the Summerset Isles were incorporated into the Empire, after the Numidium was used to crush the Altmeri armies.
They remained part of the Empire until 4E 29, when, some years after taking power of the Summerset Isles and renaming it Alinor (after the capital), the Thalmor, a political, Altmeri supremacist, group, seized control of Valenwood, severed all ties with the Empire, and renamed the two united provinces to 'The Aldmeri Dominion', after the historical union. During the next 150 years, the Aldmeri Dominion accepts the remains of Elsweyr, and invades Cyrodiil and Hammerfell, which leads to the sacking of the Imperial City and the signing of the White-Gold Concordat, further sundering the already waning power of the Empire. After the Concordat, the Thalmor could be found throughout the remains of the Empire, fortifying their power and trying to destroy any form of Talos worship.

The Altmer culture is noted for it's focus on Magicka and art. Like mentioned beforehand, their art is regarded at the height of culture, and they are known to even ornate their armour and weapons (mostly with avian themes).
Alongside the strong artistic traditions, they are known as some of the best mages and magickal researchers on Tamriel. Indeed, some of the most well known magickal organisation find their origin on the Summerset Isles, including the Psijic order and the Mages Guild. Alongside this, some of the Archmages of the Mages Guild and Imperial Battlemages were Altmer, most notably Ocato of Firsthold, Battlemage, trusted advisor of Uriel Septim VII, High Chancellor of the Elder Counsil and Potentate of the Empire.

Despite their supposed selective breeding, Altmer are known to carefully pick their partners, and it is common for couples to spend as much time together as possible.

Their culture is also known as being very structured and hierarchical, and it has occurred more than once that the higher casts decided on personal aspects of the lower castes' lives. A notable example is the institution of the Altmeri pantheon, which replaced some Aedra with ones seen as 'higher' by the nobles, and their supposed selective breeding. This focus on Altmeri supremacy, in recent years advocated by the Thalmor, has met with resentment by the younger generations of Altmer, who express the desire of more peaceful relations with the other parts of Tamriel. Even though this new movement exists, most people of Tamriel are still more familiar with the Thalmor and their predecessors, and as such still regard the Altmer as being arrogant.
Their pantheon is vast, and includes the eight divines also worshipped by the Imperials, alongside other Et'Ada, mostly related to magic (i.e. Magnus, Syrabane). Because of their Et'Ada heritage, they deeply hate Lorkhan, who they take responsible for making them mortal, along with any men-made additions to the different religions, most notably the Cyro-Nordic god-hero Talos (it is rumoured that the ban on the Talos-worship by the Thalmor is to further destroy the Towers, which would result in the collapse of Mundus and ending the Kalpa, in the hope of regaining their divinity).


*this sums up this short summary on the Altmer of the Summerset Isles. In short, even though the Altmer retain a supremacist stance towards the other races, they are not totally to blame for it, as, in some respects, they have contributed in huge ways to the rest of Tamrielic culture and knowledge*

&gt;The Three Thieves of Morrowind could tell you where they were.

True; and describing the Tribunal as three thieves is more than justified.

&gt;So could the High King of Alinor, who was the one who broke it in the first place.

Accusing a ""*High King of Alinor*"" of causing the most recent Dragonbreak seems like his assumption, but IIRC we can't even be sure who Mannimarco means with ""High King of Alinor"". Auri-El? Alinor himself?

&gt;There are others on this earth that could, too: Ysmir, Pelinal, Arnand the Fox or should I say Arctus?

Ysmir, Arctus... I'll give it to Mannimarco. Both are confirmed by MK to be Shezzarine. 

Fresh me up here: Is Arnand the Fox related to Hans the Fox/one of the 500-hundred companions? Could Pelinal be a Shezzarine?

&gt;The Last Dwarf would talk, if they would let him. 

This made me think. Yagrum Bagarn definitely gets sort of shut down, i.e. is isolated from the rest of the world, even if it is for his own good. 

&gt;As for myself, I was here and there and here again, like the rest of the mortals during the Dragon Break. How do you think I learned my mystery? The Maruhkati Selectives showed us all the glories of the Dawn so that we might learn, simply: as above, so below.

I want to start off with White-Gold first and foremost. It's widely regarded that it is now a deactivated Tower. But, how did it come to be like that? What we know about Towers can stem down to this: They're made by either Mer or et'Ada (e.g. Lorkhan) AND they have a Stone.

So, what exactly was White-Gold's Stone and how was it deactivated? It cannot be the Chim-el Adabal considering how pro-man the Stone is and that it's first owner was Alessia *on her deathbed*. Was the Temple of the One meant to be its Stone? we know that was destroyed in Oblivion (also I have a little dumb theory that the One refers to the Godhead, but that's just a dumb little theory)

Now, onto Numidium/Walk-Brass. We all know this is a special case considering this is both a Tower and a Walking Way. Still, this doesn't mean it should be lacking a Stone and most likely: the Stone is what powers the Numidium. Therefore, chances are this was a Tower built without a Stone until a Stone (the Mantella) was built for it. Or, perhaps the Numidium was a failed Tower that became fixed later with the Mantella; whatever gets proven here

For Adamantium Tower, I don't want to get into the specifics of the actual tower/scroll case/spaceship but, again, what exactly the Zero Stone is. I mean, how do we even know about the Zero Stone without having some idea on what it actually is?

Also, just to end this off, what was the Stone for Crystal-Like-Law? Considering the Tower itself was destroyed, what was it's Stone in the first place?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Moth,True,t3_1g3wwe,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1g3wwe/lets_discuss_the_towers_a_little_more_indepth/,

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. Been an exciting week, with both definite up's and definite down's I'd that I'd both like to point out. I will point them out, though, at quite a late time today, since I got distracted and lost track of time. Now, suddenly, all the Europeans are asleep. It's alright, the Aussies (and others) are still awake.

**Weekly Summary**

As I said, some definitive up's and down's. To start off positive I'd like to announce this was a fantastic week content-wise and let me revive the Community Thread segment where I point out some great threads from the week in full force. This week we had some great Apocrypha-type posts in addition to the regular Q + A and conjecture discussion threads, those being [The House is Salvation by Mr_Flippers](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1eotgh/the_house_is_salvation/), [The History of Card Games by OPGreenback](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1f16to/the_history_of_card_games/), and [Eplear and Pelinal](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1en2km/eplear_and_pelinal/) and [The Coronation of Eplear](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1esj1w/the_coronation_of_eplear/), both by Lebiro. Those were all very interesting and a great fun to read, good job guys! 

As for down's, we have had a pretty slow week traffic wise, with the latest slow in traffic continuing with only 83 new scholars this week. We've also had a relatively very impressive amount of comments we had to remove this week, which was frustrating to see. 

Still, a great week overall with all the content and discussion, so I guess no one can complain too much.

**Announcements** 

For this week's PSA [go here](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1f07u3/psa_regarding_lore_stories_fan_fiction_and_the/)

**Scholar of the Week**

I missed the feeling of it being hard to choose one scholar because there's so many contenders who have been very active and helpful at the same rate and time. I feel that today again, puts a smile on my face. So yeah, honorable mentions go for Mr_Flippers for being (as always) very active and Lebiro for posting two great threads. Still, with those two's good work, it doesn't quite give an award to either, cause unfortunately for the two, *He's* back. 

Award this week goes for the third time to the newly returned OPGreenback with yet another great Apocrypha post and many other fantastic contributions to discussion this week. Again.

---

That's pretty much it for this week, scholars, thank you for taking the time to read, if you actually do. As always feel free to do as you like in the comments and tell me about your week if you feel like doing so.

That is all. Thank you everyone for your activity, and I hope you have a great week!

**Eplear and Pelinal**

^(Foreword and translation by Harman Maurus)

*The story of Pelinal Whitestrake, the Divine Crusader, is a famous legend from the birth of the Empire. His crusades, or pogroms, swept the Ayleids into obscurity, eradicating their mighty Cyrodiilic Empire from Nibenay, Colovia, and old ‘Kreath. Tales say he rampaged as far as Elsweyr, butchering scores of Khajiit he took for more of the hated mer. But this furious crusade across the southern half of the continent raises an interesting question. At the time of Pelinal’s crusades, there was a glaring omission from his pogroms – Valenwood. A fledgling kingdom of elves, pressed close against the hills of Colovia and actively harbouring his Ayleid foes, why and how did the realm of the Boiche escape the wrath of Pelinal? Imperial scholarship on the whole, perhaps predictably, offers few answers, but the Bosmer have, if few scholarly “histories”, a vast reservoir of tales to tell.*

*One such tale is the Song of Eplear, a lengthy, though surprisingly obscure, epic poem chronicling the conquest of Valenwood by Eplear Camoran, first king of the Bosmer, and ruler at the time of Pelinal’s conquests. The Bosmeri poetry is difficult, if not impossible, to translate with any finesse into Tamrielic (though any Bosmeris-speaker should consider locating a copy), but unlike most Bosmeri epics, it is accompanied by veritable libraries of notes and annotations. The providence of these notes is ancient and confused; many are indisputably Bosmeri, but some appear Ayleid, others human. Others still are beast-writing (Imga, Centaur and Satyr) or completely mysterious. What follows is a brief translation of a small collection of these notes, in particular those pertaining to Eplear’s meeting with the Divine Crusader himself.*

Pelin-El came to the edge of Cyrod where the trees ceased to weep and began to sing, and where the Boiche kept forever-watch from the mighty trees. The white stone of the Ayleidoon would not cross that edge of Cyrod and beyond it all was unspoiled, dark and green. The graht-oaks walked and the beasts roared and the Boiche roamed indolent in the spring.

Those Ayleid who were wise fled where their stone did not go and vanished among the trees where their beads were like berries and their feathers were like leaves and where their brothers took them to hide. Their escape was an insult and Pelin-El demanded their elf-blood. The star-made-knight was bathed in the blood of elf-kings who fought him, and so he had no fear of Y’ffre’s forest. He called out the king that was in those elf-lands, for at that time there was only one and the green-sap was true-whole.

The One King of the Elves in the South, and always-king of Y’ffre’s people, was Eplear, whose helm was the skull of Great-Gold-Ape-King (whose bones were golden moonstone), and whose bow was the long wing of the Great-Roc-of-the-Hunt (whose shadow made the Boiche forget Magnus sometimes), and whose home was Green-Sap-Walking (whose blood was the blood of the forest). And Eplear King heard the call of Pelinal.

Eplear knew the seven-hundred benefits of hiding (and the three-hundred more that were his gift to all Bosmer), but he did not hide, for he knew not to this time. And Eplear knew the many ways of the hunt, that are the treasure of all his people (and were his great mastery), but he did not hunt Pelin-El, for he knew not to this time. And Eplear knew Payment-in-Kind, which Z’en taught to Y’ffre (who taught it to his favourite children) and Z’en’s mirror-children reminded to the Boiche, and so to Eplear, so he knew that Pelin-El should be paid-in-kind with cutting swords and tears, but he did not cut or tear Pelin-El, for he knew not to this time. 

Instead, Eplear Elf-King went also to the edge of Cyrod, where stood the bloody diamond. His arrows were fast and strong, but he loosed none. Instead he loosed his mighty voice that won Valenwood.

“Pelin-El, star-made-knight, butcher of my kin, bloodier of trees, many-shape (?) of Cyrod. Our strength is great and our forest is blessed. Your bloody hands have no hold on the green-sap.”

The man-beast was not to be deterred, for men know not how to flee.

But Eplear did not come out to die like those Ayleid kings. His lips parted and he roared mightily into Cyrod and Pelinal heard the wind in the trees and the crash of the sea and the splashing of rain and the roar of all the beasts. And the star-made-knight lowered his sword and turned his back on Eplear Elf-King and his forest, and never again turned his blade to that edge where the trees began to sing. Even in his Madness, Pelinal would not forget the Voice of Eplear, for Pelinal was sometimes mad but always Ada.

I wanted to solidify my knowledge on the Yokudans concerning their use of magic. I have read plenty on the Ansei and their ability to produce the Shehai, or spirit sword, which is one of my favorite topics. I am however trying to discern the similarities/differences between the Nudri-Hi, or ""eastern"" magics, and Yoku-Hi, or ""western"" magics.

After some reading ([not sure of this source](http://tamriel-rebuilt.org/?p=books&amp;section=195752)) it seems as though some magic was accepted among both Crowns and Forebears. From what I understand, the term Nudri-Hi describes magics that revolve around souls and soul stealing, so probably conjuration and/or enchanting magic which is heavily frowned upon.

Yoku-Hi is a little bit vague. I see mentions of restoration and destruction being ""suitable"" in certain practices, but I was just wondering if there was a definitive guide to both of these terms. The creation story and religious/cultural ways of the early Redguard and Yokudans is fascinating and I would love to learn more detailed information about these facets of their society.

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. It's been a great week and there is much to say, so I will dive right in. 

---

**Weekly Summary**

So the last few weeks have definitely shown relative inactivity, and there were many problems the moderators had to address, but I am happy to say things are definitely starting to lighten up very quickly. After Prince-of-Plots making [this announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bu79x/reporting_and_you_a_public_service_announcement/), the sheer amount of reporting and the quickness in which we have responded this week were at an impressive all time high. We are very happy to see you guys using the report feature much more lately, and there is very much a reason why, I'm sure some have noticed, there has been a rise in quality commenting and content this week. 

To add to that, this week, aside from the normal amount of question threads, all of which were answered with detail and at great lenth, we have also gotten a pretty darn impressive amount of high quality posts. Some of those worth mentioning are [The Amaranth Summary by Sifrael](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bue5q/amaranth_summary/), [The Sow and the Snake by OPgreenback](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1buyn1/the_sow_and_the_snake/), [On the History and Politics of Akavir by Alexxerth](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1byjl1/on_the_history_and_politics_of_akavir/), [The Nords and the Giants by Morganmarz](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1bzq5i/the_nords_and_the_giants/), and [Does the Dovahkiin have Dragon Blood, or a Dragon soul? by  dbcification](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1c81vg/its_time_to_put_this_puppy_to_bed_does_the/). All of these were very worthwhile reads, so I do advise you all do read them if you haven't yet. 

As for traffic, we continue to see around the same amount of new scholars in our latest slow wave of traffic, with 139 new scholars this week. Number of pageviews and unique users remains the same as the last few months, though, so we are happy to see lots of newcomers come and go.

**Announcements**

I do believe it is that time of the year again when we offer to revise the FAQ a bit for sake of lowering spam a bit. So, if you would like to help the cause out and lower spam, we would very much like to know which question you think should be answered on the FAQ. Preferably, we would like you to format a comment for revision of the FAQ as such:

---

**Question**

Detailed answer, in a few sentences. This should be a fact-only answer, and contain no opinion nor conjecture. If you do have a question but not an answer, feel free to still post the question and ask for an answer, as long as you believe the question is too commonly heard and answered.

([sources for answer](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/sotha-sils-last-words))

---

Thank you for anyone who wants to help contribute. Hopefully we will implement the revisions soon enough after the community thread goes inactive.

**Scholar of the Week**

In continuing with a latest thread of giving the honor to newer users, this Scholar of the Week has been impressively active both in commenting this week. *alexxerth*'s greater amount of activity and contributions this week, mostly in the field of Akaviri lore, award alexxerth as this week's SoTW. Thank you for your activity, alexxerth, and I hope to see more from you in the future.

---

That is pretty much it for this week. I'll keep more personal stuff in the comments, though I would say it has been a very enjoyable week for me. In any case, everyone can feel free once again to do whatever in Oblivion they want in the comments, and more specifically to discuss anything non-lore related as well as post cool content and introduce themselves if they are new or have just been lurking. I've also noticed the Weekly Threads have become home for some simple Q&amp;A style stuff, so feel free to do that, too, if you like.

That is all, thank you everyone for your activity, and I hope you have a great week!

Long ago, it, or shall I say they, stood tall and enormous, casting great shadows over the southern landscape. *It* ruled over the land, and joined with it as one. The land itself was forest, from the darkened wet forest in the southeast, to the high forest hills with great tall trees in the northwest. From where the forest was dense and full of critters, to the almost lifeless forest that had its trees climb the steep rise of a great volcano. The land was a forest, and the forest was *it*. 

It saw nothing, for there was nothing to see. *It* could feel shadows of critters dancing under its many leaves, circling around its many trunks. Some shadows were small, rare, so lonely and insignificant when compared to the enormous unity that was *It*. Some others were taller, numerous, and did not dance around the same way the other shadows did. Yet, while studying the shadows' pattern of dancing carefully, *it* did not alter itself, nor did it care to act or interfere with the shadow's dancing in any way.

And then, one day, the shadows began dancing much differently. They came together, joined each other close in their dancing. More shadows came, arriving from the West and the North. The many shadows greeted each other, furiously dancing closer and closer, until in a split second the shadows started devouring each other. Two shadows came together, danced, and one remained. Over and over the shadows devoured each other, each time more ferociously. *It* could see the shadows growing stronger, fiercer, altering rocks and metals and the bodily tissues of other shadows to grow their dancing stronger and more brutal. *It* has never felt such ferocity in the dancing of the shadows, never such heat and wrath in the shadows' footsteps upon the soil above *It*'s roots. 

And then the shadows turned to *It* for power. They cut down the trunks of *It* to make fortified structures, tools, and weapons. Then the shadows extracted the sap from within the trees, drinking it to grow themselves healthier and stronger, hardening it to cover themselves with outfits out of *It*'s own blood. *It* could not respond. Never has anything so terrible and awe inspiring happened to the forest. *It* could not dance like the shadows, it could not see or speak or hear or touch like the shadows. To think and to feel were *it*s only available actions, but neither could slow down the shadows' rampaging dances. So *It* stood, and it felt, and it withered. 

First the trees in the north were gone, then east and west, then in the center of the forest. The forest withered and withered until only the trees in the south were left; many, in the lands where the forest is dark and wet, less in the other side of the southern water, where the land was drier and warmer. There, *it* stood, and many of its trees. Yet the shadows were soon to come. They cut, and chopped, and slew in the dry land until the entire land was no more a forest. Only one hill remained, and there *it* stood, with but a single tree atop the hill. *It* knew the shadows were coming, hungry, yet *it* knew the single tree could not be helped. No alteration, no sympathy, no feeling or thought could help it. 

So the alterations stopped, slowly, and the sympathies withdrew, and the thoughts and feelings grew weaker and more silent. Minute by minute, hour by hour, the tree felt weaker, more withered, more exiled. 

And then *it* was alone. *It* could not feel its wet roots in the southeastern soil, could not feel the tiny shadows there dancing merrily and safely round *it*s trunk. *It* was lonely, afraid, withering, shriveling. *It* could not sustain so many leaves and such a tall trunk, so it altered itself smaller, smaller. *It* shed its bark, dried its sap, withdrew its leaves. 

When the shadow came *it* was a white, shriveling tree, 5 feet high. *It* felt the shadow come closer, run its hand on *it*s tiny shriveled branches, *It* was ready to die. *It* dried its sap to a deadly solid, shed its leaves completely, making it so the death would be easy and without pain.

The shadow picked up its metallic tool. And then the shadow left.

So there stood the Hist, withered, cold and dying, in the heat of the once beautiful wasteland. 

It remembered nothing, did nothing, felt nothing. And then, under the scorching sun, it withered away, and became *nothing*.

To my knowledge, it is widely accepted that the Last Dragonborn is a Shezzarine, thereby filling one side of the Aka-Shor enantiomorph. 

Alduin, as the self-proclaimed first son of Akatosh, king of dragons and attempted ruler of Skyrim quite easily fits the role of Aka and King, making the individual trying to overthrow him, the Last Dragonborn, as the rebel. This quite nicely fits the Aka-Shor and King-Rebel aspects. The one thing I can't figure out in all of this is who counts as the Observer to complete the Enantiomorph. I found this a very difficult topic at all to look up, but as I understand it the Observer must be wounded/maimed/killed/consumed/forgotten during the overthrowing to fill their role.

Originally I thought it might be Paarthurnax, as he literally observes (and participates in) the fight with Alduin if you don't kill him beforehand, but as far as I know, he suffers no ill effects from this event. I thought it might be the Throat of the World itself, but that seems a bit of a stretch. I am at a loss, and it seems too complete of an Enantiomorph to be coincidence.

The piece is widely attributed to Mach-Ei, an Argonian merchant from Chorrol who disappeared in 3E 432. The Oblivion Crisis and the passage of two hundred years have prevented much light from being shed on the details. According to varying reports, Mach-Ei had been romantically involved with either Seed-Neeus or her daughter Dar-Ma. Official records kept at the Chapel of Stendarr state that Mach-Ei ultimately fell victim to the Hackdirt Brethren. In the wake of Ulfric’s rebellion, some Nordic literary scholars have rejected this account, though the priests of Chorrol maintain that their forebears would not have participated in any attempt to cover up the silencing of a dissident.*

*On a separate note, some scholars suspect that the work may have in fact been a joint effort, as some have noted that the authorial voice varies between fragments. Others suggest that this is evidence that the author labored on the work over an extensive period of time, likely in secret.*

------

The relationship between the Imperial and the Imperialized is a relationship of domination^4, of varying degrees of a complex hegemony, and is quite accurately indicated in the title of Talen-Lai’s classic *The Black Marsh and Imperial Dominance.* One need only look to popular Imperial literature and scholarly work to see the mindset that props up this power dynamic. In Waughin Jarth’s serials featuring the Imperial hero Decumus Scotti, the Black Marsh becomes merely a backdrop, an exotic locale with a troubled people indebted to their heroic Imperial savior. The Imperial Geographical Society subtly discredits the Argophile historian Brendan the Persistent, suggesting in *Pocket Guide to the Empire, 3rd Ed.,* that his foolish respect for the Argonian people brought about his demise. In the same volume, the Black Marsh is referred to as “backward” and “the stuff of myth, not history,” further solidifying the view of the Black Marsh as a place populated by the Other, as a mystified eastern land shrouded in darkness. 

The astute reader will be quick to note that the racism I have identified as underlying the Imperial project seems endemic to all conquering races. Indeed, Torval the Pilot (patron saint of Leyawiin) and his Aldmeri comrades described the Black Marsh as ""fetid, evil swamp lands” populated by “human lizards.”

But such outward racism will never be as effective at yoking the Argonian as the sublimely subversive Imperial project. Imperial subjects of all races either assume the status of citizen and succumb to the interpellation of Imperial culture or become Otherized if they reject the influence of Imperial culture and cling to their own. Neither option permits the Argonian to exercise his own agency. There is very little consent to be found, for example, in Crantius Colto’s encounter with the title character of Crassius Curio’s^5 *The Lusty Argonian Maid.* Here we have a bawdy play rarely spoken of in polite company which nevertheless reflects a widely influential model of the Argonian woman as she is perceived. Colto’s maid never has any say over her own body and will be punished for neglecting her cleaning duties to “polish [Colto’s] spear.”^6 Never in the play is she given the chance to speak for herself except in her vain attempt to persuade the ribald Colto to leave her at peace; she is never given the space to have a presence or reject his lecherous advances.

Note the tension here between the desires of the Imperial woman, who needs her maid to clean and spare her the toil of labor, and the Imperial man who would put his Argonian servant to his own uses which border on rape^7. Lifts-Her-Tail^8 becomes defined not only by her body, as all Argonians must be defined, but by her sexuality and her willingness to be exploited. She becomes, as it were, *dehumanized.* This word, once bandied about by Imperial scholars, is now widely rejected, but not, I propose, because Imperial scholars recognize how it paints an incomplete picture of the rights of sentient beings but, rather, because its paints such an embarrassingly accurate picture of the prejudices underlying the Imperial project.



4.) Of *dominion,* one might even say if feeling cheeky, though one would not say it aloud. 

5.) I am not in the business of defaming my contemporaries, but it should not surprise the reader to note that the name of the protagonist of The Lusty Argonian Maid bears such an obvious similarity to that of its author. This Nibenean name is likely a pseudonym assumed for the purpose of publishing his pornography, but I would not be the least bit surprised if the author’s real name shared the “Cr—us C—o” structure. He probably felt delightfully brazen, as if he was getting away with something by making his protagonist such an obvious author avatar. The possibility that the author of this erotica is not a member of the Imperial race does not escape me, but his pathologies are certainly shared by all humans under the panopticon of Imperial society. In Cyrodiil, there are reports of adventurers finding copies of Curio’s work even in caves inhabited (the Imperial would say ""infested"") with goblins; in Solstheim, finding the work in the hands of the elusive Rieklings is not unheard of. It is hard to determine the extent to which these beings understand the work. For all we know, they could be using the pages as bum wad. And good for them if that's the case; I'm sure the pages of Curio's work will smell much sweeter when all the hateful words have been covered in goblin faeces. 

6.) Volume 1, IV.iii 

7.) Doubtless, outside of the realm of fiction these sexual fantasies tend to manifest themselves in a decidedly more violent fashion. 

8.) Note the author never refers to her by her Black Marsh name.


[…]

The Imperial of this narrative is characterized by civilization, strength, and authority; the sexualized Argonian embodies foreignness, submissiveness, and the exotic. Whereas the Imperial inhabits his head, the Argonian inhabits only her body. To Colto (and Curio, and too many readers), the Argonian maid’s intellectual and emotional faculties are of no significance; only her material body matters, her flesh which his wife can instruct to mop the floors and the Imperial nobleman can use to “bake his bread”^15



15.) This crude (and rather poorly constructed) euphemism comes from a passage in Volume 2, VII.II.

The few words we do know in dwemeris should be: 

*Fell - City

*Volen - Hammer

*Vvarden - Strong shield

*Drung - Might[mighty?]

However after reading 'The Ruins of Kemel-Ze' we can find an inconsistency in the language. This is because 'Ze' also appears to mean city. 
Now perhaps this is just a mistake or this can support the theory that the Dwemer language was changing over time, where 'fell' slowly changes to 'zel' which we find in the names of ruins in Skyrim.

We can assume ze = zel because in the book Vvardenfell is spelled with one 'l' not the conventional 'll' so it can also be said that the 'zel' is also spelled with one less 'l' or even that a change in pronunciation has occurred in the language. 

Which leads me onto this: when we look at the dwemer language we should keep in mind that the ruins may hold old spelling or pronunciation from different regions/times making it harder to decode

However in one region (skyrim) we have a nice piece of dwemeris. The 'Rosetta stone'. 
I have been trying to decode the dwemer from common aleiyd words found on the falmer transcription. Using [this](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/aldmeri-alphabets) I think i may have found some skyrim-dwemer words. I'm not sure if these are already known but I will also continue to translate the dwemer words and post updates when enough have been found.

These words are:

*Kemel - Cliff

*Ze/Zel - City

*Chun - And

*Anum - Life

*Aka - King

*Mora - Wood

*Du - Nu(in Falmer) (possibly 'New' in english)

I cannot be 100% sure but am pretty confident with the ones already found, there is still a long way to go and i will gladly take any input/help with more experienced scholars. 
There is one last thing 'th' appears to mean 'your' whilst 'thua' might mean 'your' when referring to concepts or ideas leading me to think 'thuamer' means 'Your driven' and 'thua vanchningth' means 'Your eternal [besia]'
The reason I chose 'chun' over 'th' as being 'and' is because we see many comers where the 'Chun' should be.

It's not a particularly happy tale, but at least one character will end up quite merry before the end. Without further ado, here we go.

.

.




Gather round, my kin-children, to hear the wisdom of mine old bones! Never once in my long years have I told the truth, and now I suffer for the tricks of my youth! Rockjoint spreads all through my bones, and soon I'll not be able to walk 't'all. Still, here is a story passed down from my da, and to him from his da, and so into the distant green years no living man recalls.

Once, there was a writer, a fool in the court of a bigger one. He served old Pelagius the Mad while he yet lived, but he sought to make his name known throughout Cyrodiil. See, them men of Cyrodiil love their books even more than we hardy folk love a good story 'round the fire, and even certain bad books by stupid men were somewhat well-received in those days. So the young writer sat down to make sense of the histories of men long-dead, that which came before our bless'd Talos took the throne of the Empire.

I d'no if you young ones have heard this or not, but before our mighty Talos took the Ruby Throne, there was a long time of war, with petty kings and weak rulers, and the whole of the Empire in confusion. So this fool writer took it upon himself to tell the ""real"" story of what happened in this time, this Interregnum, as the history-men call it. And so he sealed his doom. Keep in mind, there were a few records of that time.

He, however, decided to forgo them all, and - curse his stupidity! - he even took away some of our mighty Talos' deeds at the close, for his farce ends when the great and mighty Talos' wars began. He first decided to set a stage - three kings of three realms arrayed against each other. All vied for the Ruby Throne, and fought constantly for it. But, this was no great tale, he thought. He then recalled that the histories of the last year of the First Era focused on the cursed daedra Prince, Mehrunes Dagon. So, he decided on a villain greater than any of the three kings, a villain cloaked in the form of a daedra prince. Molag Bal, cursed though he is, was the daedra this poor fool chose to be the uniting villain, the overarching evil of the time.

Mind you, this is no more true than were I to say that I believe I'll step outside, down some mead, and be a dragon as large as Solitude at my own will.

So his three kings united 'gainst the cursed daedra Prince Molag Bal,  who, as the story apparently goes, was tryin' to draw all of us and the world with us into *his* world, if you can believe that. I suppose the barriers them Psijic mages put up didn't apply, or he just forgot they existed like he forgot the rest of our world's history, but either way, that was his backing. Next, he made an unknown, a member of one of the three armies, step forward to aid the kings united as they strove with the hordes of Coldharbour.

And by chance, the fool of a playwright decided that besmirching the history of our blessed Talos wasn't enough, so he besmirched the names and histories of the three kings, one of which was a true Nord, of strong Voice and stronger arm. They fell away at the might of the daedra, but this lone champion stepped forward, and by ""previously unknown Dawn magicks"", as he put it, he sealed away the daedra Prince Molag Bal, and his cursed realm with him.

All his lies completed, and his trampling of histories complete, he took the book to a book-binder, who made him a few copies to give out. Thank the Nine those stuck-up Cyrodiils in the Imperial City laughed in his face and refused to buy such a travesty.

Now, you must be thinking to yourselfs, ""Old Skald-uncle, what was the point of the story if all that happens is he's laughed at?"" Well, my kin-children, fret not. The lesson is this: the fool, wandering through the forests southeast of the City, a copy of his cursedly-terrible play in hand, came upon a majestic Elk. He looked as if Hircine himself would consider him a true prize and joy to hunt, so great was his stature. As the fool playwright crept closer to the Elk, he failed to realize two things: firstly, that he was looking down from unstable ground down a small, sheer hill to the Elk, and secondly that elk in Cyrodiil, while rare, have sharp antlers, the better to fight their kin with for the best of what they have. 

The fool crept closer, over the edge of the hill and onto a dead log that hung over. He, being a fool, didn't see that it was dead, but it held his weight nonetheless. He was suddenly struck by the idea to sketch the great Elk, so he reached back into his pack for his book.

However, the book was so heavy with deceit and stupidity that the log broke neath its weight as he shifted his, and he fell down, down, till the end of the great Elk's antlers pierced through the fool playwright's heart. And so he died, and his terrible play met an equally bad end, for the Elk loved nothing more than to devour books whole. So our tale ends, with the body of the foolish playwright never stirring again, and a very merry Elk chewing up the last bits of that terrible play. And so, even Molag Bal was revenged, for the Elk conquered the fool without even trying.

So, dear kinsfolk, both young and old, let this, and mine own condition, be lessons to you - don't practice deceit! For should you, you may end up like me, unable to move or do a thing to help yourself, or you may end up like the fool, dead at the base of a hill, self-gored on an Elk greater than you.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_15f1bx,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15f1bx/virtue_everwatchful_part_the_seventh_deceit_merry/,

This week was a rather interesting one in /r/teslore. After last week's glory, I had to remind myself that this is normal way things go, and I can't go around being disappointed. Really, this was rather a good week, we've seen plenty of good posts, but I will get to them a little bit later. Before starting up the normal way of things I'd like to discuss new scholars and the FAQ.

Our subreddit is slowly but surely getting more and more popular. In just four months we have amassed 2400 new scholars, and we keep on growing in ranks. This, obviously, has some good and some bad effects. 

New scholars mean more original content, more ways of thought, and more interesting minds speculating and adding their opinions to the ones of old ""veterans"". New scholars also mean waves of unoriginal content, questions that have been repeated 30 times over and misunderstandings already understood by many older members. 

This is no reason to be angry at new users, they simply do not know. So far, as I've observed, new scholars must learn through trial and error what subreddit members like and what they don't. For this reason, I will be posting a *guide for new scholars* shortly. Reading both the guide *and* the FAQ will be very important.

Talking of the FAQ, it seems the popular opinion of both members and moderators is that there should be an update to the FAQ.

And so there shall be.

As time passes, more and more threads once thought of as relevant are now over-posted and are getting old. Updating the FAQ should be a continuous process, so today's update will not be the final one, nor will it be the only one in a while. Anytime you have any question that you think should be answered in the FAQ *please* tell me in that week's community thread. For today, please post any question you want answered on the FAQ in this format:


**Question**

Response (shouldn't be too long, about a paragraph)

*source*

Please do help me with this. If you don't comment now you're complaining later will be annoying and irrelevant. 

Thank you for reading the rant. Now, with all seriousness put away, it's time for your regularly scheduled Community Thread:

As I've already said, this week has been an interesting one. Though we did not get a very large amount of posts (about a page-full) we did get some high-quality posts from the ones that were posted. Posts such as [dbcification's post on Falmer societal structure and gender roles](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10nijm/the_betrayed_seem_to_have_developed_or_perhaps/), [regalnerd's post on the Forsworn and Dibella](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10urv8/the_forsworn_and_dibella/) and ornerycretin's posts about [Edge-Witchery](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10xvoq/edgewitchery/) and [Nord Totems](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/10p5oy/nord_totems_and_god_equivalents/). Also as I've already stated, we are slowly but steadily growing in ranks, with 86 new scholars this week. New scholars please go ahead and post about yourselves and give us a little introduction in the comments. It would be great if you old members would welcome the new scholars and perhaps even introduce yourselves to them. The community in this subreddit is important, and different members' interactions with others members is also very important. Do remember this is the purpose of these threads, to give space for community discussion and more lore-irrelevant talk. Talking of the community and it's good members, time to reveal this week's

**Scholar of the Week**

This week was quite a definite choice. This scholar, despite being new to the subreddit, has already gained my full respect and hopefully the respect of the rest of the community. He/she (I hate to figure these things out) has posted some extremely interesting threads in the last two weeks, as well as replied to other's threads in a thoughtful and understandable manner. This week's Scholar of the Week is:

**Ornerycretin**

Thank you very much for posting, Ornerycretin, you provided the subreddit with some great posts lately, and there is no doubt that you should be mentioned for it. Wuuthrad, Pedanterrific, and Lilrhys are waiting for you at The Honorable Men's Tavern (See, I named it now!) to celebrate your achievement.

Thank you guys for another great week. I am currently in a pretty challenging phase, encountering a heavy-load of problems both at school and at home, so it's good to come home everyday and relax while reading a good post about the Forsworn or Vivec. Thank you guys for posting, keep on doing the awesome job, and I'm just going to say how much I love being a moderator of this fine community again. I hope you guys had a great week, remember to post suggestions for the FAQ and tell me about your week in the comments (Again, I do care.) Also post any suggestions or complaints, I'll be glad to hear them and will take your opinions into my consideration. Have a great weekend, and keep on postin'

&gt; ""As you know, he's probably the oldest and most powerful wizard alive. Not counting liches, or divine sorcerers like Vivec, of course. And there may be some older in the West, on Summerset Isles, perhaps.""

That got me thinking who could be older, and who is the most famous of Liches? Mannimarco comes to mind. However, Mannimarco was trained by the psijics and left the order around the same time as Vanus Galerion founded the Mages Guild. UESP puts this at 2e 230. The last time we see Mannimarco is 3e 433 (Oblivion Crisis), which puts him at just over 1100 years. So Divayth Fyr is older.

Divayth Fyr is from the first era, he is likely born in within the first three centuries (1E 0 being 4244 years before the events of TES III). This means he was first born as Chimer. Resdayn is not founded until 1E 436, The Battle of Red Mountain occurs at 1E 700, so at this point he is already relatively aged by the standard of the average Chimer. So he is roughly the same age as the Tribunal but lacking their divinity.

Further, two in-game books point to Divayth Fyr's incedible knowledge of the Oblivion and its planes. [The Doors of Oblivion](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/doors-oblivion) says that he is able to willing move between Mundus and oblivion, and [Varieties of Daedra](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/varieties-daedra) show his intimate familiarity with, well, the varieties of Daedra, especially those of Mehrunes Dagon.

Then there is [this bit of monkeytruth](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/sotha-sils-last-words) where Divayth Fyr is being played by the developer Gary Noonan, or at least according to a [webmaster at The Imperial Library](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/problems-oddities-and-feedback?page=8).


So who exactly is this guy? He was alive for the Battle for Red Mountain, and is spending the end of his life studying two of its most lasting consequences (the Blight and the Disappearance of the Dwemer). He manages to live longer than his contemporaries, at least two of which became divine. Is there anyone else even close to approaching his life-span?

Is there anything else out there on him? and, is there anything following up on him post-oblivion crisis?",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1339628517.0,,Armigers,True,t3_v0m5b,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/v0m5b/whats_up_with_divayth_fyr/,

The discussion hinged on how Meridia feels about Hircine and his followers, which we don't really know (along with a lot else that's unknown about Meridia).

In researching the topic, I ended up at [this](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/imperial-census-daedra-lords) MK post about the daedric princes. In it, he mentions, as we know from other sources, that Azura and Boethia tend to pal around. This got me to thinking about other relationships between daedric princes.

We know that Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon are brothers. Malacath doesn't really associate with the others, and it's speculated that he might actively dislike other daedric princes on account of being an outcast aetherial spirit like Meridia. 

What other relationships are there between the daedra? Which ones are friends? Which ones actively oppose each other? So on and so forth.

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread, very happy to see you all again after a disproportionately long week caused by last week's early posting time which was further caused by me flying over a large portion of the North Hemisphere for the duration of last weekend, but fear not, we are back to our normal posting schedule! 

**Weekly Summary**

I'd like to begin by welcoming the 154 new scholars that have come across /r/teslore this week and decided to stick around to listen to and discuss with us in our many discussions. And when I say many discussions, I mean it, we've been getting a generally very large amount of activity this week, so good job contributing everyone. I also like that there seems to be at least detailed and thoughtfully written comment in many or most threads this week.

Aside from that, I don't believe there are any threads specifically worthy of mentioning, part for [The Sea of Ghosts](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1jqhyy/the_sea_of_ghosts/) by errantgamer and a couple other smaller apocrypha/explanation-styled threads.

**Announcements**

No special announcements this week, though I'll once again remind everyone new or that has not done so previously to read through the sidebar and the FAQ, very important that you do.

**Scholar of the Week**

Referring back to my statement that everyone's been doing very well this week, it's impossible to pick out a single scholar, seeing as a very big variety of scholars all did similarly well throughout the week.

That said, I did use to have a personal rule of not giving the awards to moderators, but that kinda ended when Rhys gave me the award, so why not. Next week a large portion of us mods are going to be either going on or continuing their trips in various countries, leaving Mr. PoPs to face the horde of shitposting the we hide under the [redacted] tag in quite the solitary way, so I'm going to hand him the award for volunteering for such a job. Pray we don't happen to get plugged.

That said, instead of using this situation to shitpost, use it to help out PoP by starting to report whenever you see content that needs to be removed. If you know the rules and want to help out the community, this is the best way to do so. We used to have a lot of reporting but have no-where near as much nowadays, so I'd be happy to see you guys go back to helping us out.

---

Right, over-sized SOTW rant over, feel free to do as you like in the comments, be it introducing yourself if you are new, talking about your week, or whatever you feel like doing.

Thank you everyone for your activity and I hope you have a great week!

The subreddit has been growing wildly and the number of scholars is skyrocketing, and so our community grows and grows. As these things happen, the moderation team gets increasingly overwhelmed by the traffic and large amounts of activity. To add to that, the moderation is always looking to improve the subreddit, yet in order to do so we must garner new ideas and people to bring those ideas about in action.

Therefore the Elder Council has decided we are going to welcome a new recruit into the team. It was decided that, as with last time, we will once again make the election process democratic and decided upon by the community. 

In the comments of this thread, you are welcome to present yourself as a nomination. Anyone (with the exception of a few rules that will be listed below) may present a nomination, and a week after this thread is posted, the scholar with the most community support will be welcome to join the moderation team.

Remember, though, there are different traits and skills that one must have in order to be an effective moderator. A moderator of /r/teslore first of all must know the community well and should be active within the subreddit. Having been on the subreddit a long amount of time, and having a record of activity and helpfulness on the subreddit, will both make a scholar more suitable to be a moderator. A moderator should also have a reason to join the moderation team, that is whether the nominated scholar wishes to improve the community, and whether they have the time and are willing to put forward the effort to actively and continuously moderate the subreddit. That means going everyday and looking through all recent posts and comments and identifying which ones break the rules, actively participating in moderator discussion, and being able to quickly respond to reports and the concerns of different users. Moderation is still a job, it may come with a cool flair and green tinted comments, but there's also work to put in.

The traits and skills listed above should be considered by any who wish to nominate themselves. Please explain how you match the descriptions above and tell us why you believe you would make a good moderator in your nomination comment. Just posting your name and your desire is not enough.

We do have one rule about the voting that you should keep in mind, though:

There shall be absolutely no advertising or garnering support for your nomination outside of this thread. If the moderators find or have evidence of anyone advertising their nomination in any other subreddit or community either linked or not linked to /r/teslore in any way, your nomination will be removed and you will not be given the option to become a moderator.

That's really all you need to know. The Winner of the Election will be announced in next week's Community Thread. Good luck to all candidates!

I thereby request this gathering of esteemed scholars review and critique the manuscript as you see fit.

I know that I will likely be killed for what I write in these pages, and my books will burned be for heresy, but my solitary life must come to a close at some point, and I'd rather be killed by a priest than a mudcrab.

I open with a story that I know to be true: Hundreds of years ago there was a man above men. This was the man that closed the gates to Oblivion throughout Cyrodil, who mustered Martin Septim's forces and drove back the invading daedra from the Imperial City. However, this was also the man who would find his way into the isles of madness that make up the prince Sheogorath's realm. There he witnessed every sort of depravity and mirth, a virtual cornucopia of brilliance and decay, all with a sickening patina of insanity. Most importantly, however, this hero witnessed order. He observed the linearization of absurdity, the organization of chaos. Behind this order sat a library, kept by an immortal librarian, filled with books that predicted every event in the plane's seemingly inane existence. Extrapolated from the equations that guide a falling object, these books held knowledge beyond the reach of so-called gods. This is the order of knowledge I seek, this is what guides my quill against the inevitable fletching of an arrow. 

I posit that there are no gods. But what of the Oblivion gates? What of the Divines? ""My wife was cured by a priest!"" You say, but I know the truth. There are fundamental powers in this world, and perhaps they come from other planes of existence, but I am inclined to believe that, despite the undeniable existence of the plethora of planes in this universe, all power is derived from the reality we experience. I say that the sun is no hole in reality, the planets are not the bodies of dead gods, the daedra are not immortal spirits and the divines are a consequence, not an impetus.

Let us begin with Aetherius and the sun and stars. I was told, when I was a student, that the sun and stars are the holes ripped from our plane into Aetherius by Magnus and his comrades upon their escape from Mundus. I was told that *all* magic is delivered from Aetherius and that, perhaps, every living being's soul is comprised of it. *I*, on the other hand, disagree with this explanation, as it is lacking both in evidence and in rigor. I have observed, through the use of a salvaged Dwemer astronomical device, the movements of the 'planes.' They race about the sun in caucus, chasing their tails, but never stopping. They are driven by some invisible force that is exuded from the sun. What is this force? It is a variety of magic. The sun is no hole to Aetherius, it is like Nirn, in that it is massive, but it is more so. The sun is so massive that it pulls itself inwards, as we, bodies on Nirn, are pulled inward. This compression, much like how the Dwemer ignited gas in an empty cylinder with the thrust of a piston, causes fire. However, unlike the Dwemer piston, the sun-fire destroys whatever stuff exists within, releasing, by my analysis, raw magicka. Raw magicka, thereby, is the driving force of the visible planes, those heavenly bodies that exist about us. The sun is reaching out to their masses; each particle of dust possesses a tiny amount of magicka, but, on the scale of planes, they are massive beacons for the sun's energy. How, then, does Nirn hold us captive to its surface? I suggest that within Nirn is a similar, far weaker, core of stuff undergoing conversion into magicka. Furthermore, I posit that the stars are but suns at a distance, while the constellation of the serpent is, somehow, a reversal of the process, the conversion of magicka into matter.

Now I will address the subject of magic use. As a practitioner of magics myself I became frustrated at the colleges and guilds for their total ignorance of how magic operates. It is your will, they said, that drives matter to submit; it is Aetherius, they lectured, that pours forth our power; it is our soul, they wrote, that gives us access to these wonders; no, say I, you have it only half-right. Indeed, by my experiments, it seems that the sun, thought to be a hole to Aetherius, is a major source of raw magicka, so it is reasonable to see why the connection may be made. However, assuming my theories on the sun are correct, it is the sun itself that powers our magics, much in the same way it heats the air. Furthermore, Nirn's internal magicka engine provides a supplement of magicka that we mages must draw from when the sun's magicka radiation is blocked by our plane's mass. And yet, this is not the sum of magicka generation. I believe, having worked in pocket vacuum planes of oblivion, that magicka cannot be destroyed by normal means. 
If I will lightning from my fingers I lose a reserve of magicka, just as one blowing out a candle loses a reserve of air. The air released to effect the extinguish is not lost, it continues, it becomes part of the environment and one must inhale again to replenish their reserves. So, too, does magicka, taking form as I will it to, become environmental, and a mage must inhale ambient magicka to replenish. The accumulation of magicka is two-fold: first, one may accumulate magicka simply through ingesting magicka laden food, e.g. magicka potions, second, through rest and meditation. The first method takes magicka that has joined to objects in the environment, leaching into them like rainwater, and, if the food utilizes magicka in a benign way, it may remain in the system until digestion. Furthermore, some plants have shown an affinity to magicka and I believe they may use it much like they may use sunlight in growth, especially if one considers that sunlight may, itself be a form of magicka. The second method resembles how the magicka-mongering plant absorbs energy; as one rests in meditation their will becomes a vacuum, and, as is known, nature abhors a vacuum. Thus, like a raisin soaked in wine, the mage's mind absorbs the ambient magicka. I believe that this is similar to how the atronach absorbs magicka, they are a vacuum of will until the moment they cast, however, to be capable of this switch of will they must be dead to all other elements, but this is beside the point. Where the magicka is stored, however, is an interesting problem. Fat is stored in fatty tissues, is magicka stored in magical tissues? Instead, it is stored, as energy, in the muscles and spine when a mage casts, but it binds to, and radiates from, any cell it is carried to and absorbed by in the body when it is not being drawn to a vacuum.
The mage's connection to magicka is through their will, and, therefore, through their mind. The mind exerts itself through the organization of one's internal magicka like a child playing on a beach: first, one's will digs a channel through the sands of matter, creating a vacuum, then that vacuum is filled with the seawater of one's own magicka, shaped by the type of vacuum created. Thus it is not the release of magicka that defines its manifestation, but rather the manner of vacuum through which it travels. (It may be of some note that one may liken the act of will to a tether, instead of a vacuum, with the energy of magicka traveling along it, but I believe that vacuum's connection to its absorption facilitates a better understanding of the concept) In fact, I believe this is how soul gems work, by utilizing the will of the dead to sustain a vacuum around it the soul gem itself, being unstable matter, exudes magicka, manifesting however the will of the trapped soul was implemented, but, again, I digress. By the laws of entropy, magicka is always disseminating farther into the universe, therefore, nearer the beginning of time, a willful mage may have had massive stores of energy to power grander scheme than those available normally today (Though some recently discovered artifacts in Winterhold may change that, and some matter may be specially predisposed towards self-annihilation. The latter technique, I believe, is what gave the tribunal its power, immense radiation from some ore decaying from matter into magicka.)

Now I address the gods. I do not deny the evidence of the daedra, for they have ravaged this world, nor do I deny the power of the divines, for only a fool would ignore the magic of their shrines. However, I do not believe that either are what we think they are. First, I shall consider the daedra and their planes of Oblivion. These beings, whose princes are undeniably gifted in the manipulation of magicka, are no more than the most powerful wizards. I propose that, instead of using the radiation from a magicka engine, (such as the sun, or a plane), or ambient energy and accumulated deposits to power their will, the daedric princes, and, likely, other such powerful beings, generate their own engines through initially massive reserves of magicka. Once one can detonate matter upon itself it begins a chain reaction that such a being can use to power their own magic, even develop their own plane of existence. However, to accumulate the initial magicka and to prevent such an engine from destroying your mind and exploding outwards into the plane, one must have exceptional will or be supplemented by specifically designed instruments. I believe that the daedra, having existed when magicka was more densely packed in Mundus, found themselves capable of this feat, and, being selfish, used it to develop invisible planes. Furthermore, a willful wizard with enough power may be able to, by willing a vacuum between planes, travel or summon creatures, though, as Nirn is a well-defined plane with its own, independent magicka engine, and therefore, more pull, it is far easier to travel to Nirn, than from. (However, the internalization of the magicka engines seems to bind princes to their realms, requiring proxies, avatars, aspects or complicated rituals to travel from their plane.)
The divines and their ilk, the aspects of the aedra, are an entirely different matter. They, by my investigations, do not exist, at least, not in the conventional sense. In fact, they are figments of a collected will and are fulfilled by magicka siphoned from the sun. Every shrine built in their honor, every prayer said in their name and every story told of their virtues widens further the vacuum. As shrines are the locations at which the most will is exerted they are the locations at which the most magicka flows in, and, therefore, they have magical properties, cast, not by a god, but by an institution of wills. This may seem like an excellent opportunity for the common man to enjoy the benefits of magic, however, it is also a serious threat to the stability of the plane, our defense from daedra and the operation of powerful magics. As religious intent draws more and more magicka from the sun and from Nirn the less there is for the common mage, the less there is to prevent invasions from the Oblivious planes and the less there may be to stabilize grand projects performed by mage collectives. While harmless in moderation, as the followings of religion grow steadily and may soon distort the natural tides of magic.

In short, I see that all matter is made of magicka, this magicka is released when the matter is annihilated (explaining the sun). The mage's will, in meditation, is still, a vacuum, that absorbs magicka. When casting, the mage forms vacuums in reality and fills them with magicka. Daedra internalize the annihilation of matter to maintain the Oblivious planes. The Divines and their kin don't exist, instead they are the result of many wills drawing in magicka, but away from its other uses.

Though I may be proven wrong on many points I believe that my methods are sound and my logic is clear. If I am claimed to be wrong, I hope it is with logic and sound method, not by passion and ignorance. If nothing else I hope that this manuscript serves to challenge the beliefs you hold and propels you onwards for the search of truth.

You'd first learn about it in Whiterun. Just passing by on the way to falkreath, to pay your respects. To fetch a bit of money. And its a long road. You need rest. In the taverns, just a Couple of septims for a sip of sap. Then visions, purple, and everything slows down.



And you listen to the gossip, that the tree was seeded by a floating machine island city. Delirious ramblings. Another sip, another purple sharp sting in your mind, time flies, distorts, feels wierd. Good.


Flying floating piece of hell. Tree and root and sap and soul machines. More talk. Then noticed another wiser man sitting by the fire. He should be wearing his cloak to cover his face, for all I could tell from the gentle features, this was a wizard. They should never show their side of their face, its bad luck. Especially in a tavern with worn working men, all drunk.


And he saps, crooked fingers sparking a bit, and his eyes glaze over, and he is gone for fifteen minutes. A sip, just a taste, is enough.


He speaks softly, sometimes coherently. The red mountain puked itself to death, he says. The sick rock spit out its internals, he says. Some of the melted bile was thrown up as far as solstheim. I nod, lick my lips, and purple flashes.


The red bile sank into the ice and snow, melted itself into the rocks of the island. Veins. And the great black loungs of the mound, split themselfes inside out, and bellows of ash and bile spawned beings of hate. All pulsating to the same rhythm.


The sleeping tree makes you drowsy. Makes you dream. But if you fight it, you wake up more than you were awake before. I'm wide awake now, frightened by waking nightmares, ash men screaming ash into my face. I shake it off.


The soft speaker is handed the sap. Others, like me, want him to continue. And he is hesitant, awake enough it seems, to keep secrets. But dreaming his story so vividly that he can't help but share it. Like a showman. A magician, illusionist.


He throwback sap, holes his hand, and blow out small firery rocks and ash towards the fire. A miniature show. Captivating. I see the chunks of glassy magma burn holes into the flames. Blood of god, he says. Old god, he says.


The brass that kept the tower stable, melted away. And the tower took off, like a fireball into the night, a guiding star. And the empty mountain cracked, like an egg shell, as the yolk penetrated Mereth.


He uses his one long finger to demonstrate. And I see a man spearing a woman. Laughter.



Now we drink sap, from a tree, from a root dug into a heart, from a world that made itself from itself, as punishment for itself. And we are none the wiser.


He makes a toast.


And what I know is, this is hearty good, this is sugar from the bee queen, and the seed found what it was meant to find, and it will tell its mother where it found milk, if we don't keep sapping it. It will grow up to become a beacon, but we drink it all away, like a husband drinks hos family fortune away on his deathbed, so the bastard son won't ever see the estate.


And he ends his show with a mouthful, and sink into a torpor. While I try to cope with the imagery of a giant spigot, crashing around, shielding me from the floating islands.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Telvanni,True,t3_1fmbfr,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1fmbfr/the_sleeping_tree/,

I've been thinking about the Orsimer lately, and about Malacath. I remember reading in PGE3 that Gortwog established a new priesthood in Orsinium that worships Trinimac, believing that Malacath is actually a separate entity, a demon that seeks to keep the Orsimer as Pariah-folk forever. 

Regarding Malacath, I think Gortwog may be right to an extent. My reasoning is, we see Malacth not only lends the Orsimer his patronage, but is also seen supporting ogres and trolls. Why would Trinimac-turned-Malacath even care for the ogres?

I'm not entirely sure about Trinimac still being alive, considering that Boethiah ate him (even though Malacath says this is too ""literal minded"") but could Malacath have actually existed as a daedra before Trinimac was eaten? Perhaps the reason we never heard of Malacath prior is because he is, afaik, not considered a daedra lord amongst the other daedra. Maybe Boethiah, being the prince of plots, tricked Trinimac's followers in to believing that Malacath was indeed Trinimac corrupted, tricking them into following Malacath instead of Trinimac. 
Since Malacath is the god of outcasts and the bloody curse, the followers of Trinimac were changed into the Orsimer to fall under Malacath's sphere along with the ogres, trolls and possibly other creatures.

So in summary, while Trinimac may be dead, my theory is that Malacath is not actually a corrupted Trinimac, but rather was a deadra lord from the beginning which Boethiah tricked the Orsimer into following by way of eating Trinimac as a means to get revenge against Trinimac and his followers for killing Lorkhan.

When Veloth led his people to Resdayn after hearing the teachings of Boethiah I was always under the impression Boethiah told the Chimer the about the ""lies"" the Aedra told and informed them about Lorkhan's test. To me this seems really out of character for the Deadra to do unless they had other motivations.

The daedra can typically be seen as selfish, and originally they mocked Lorkhan ""Cut part of ourselves off? We'll create our own worlds and rule over it without losing a part of ourselves."" They also seem to be pretty jealous of their own power, Azura in particular as we saw in ""Azura and the Box"" and her cursing the Chimer into Dunmer.

My thoughts, why would Deadra, who are typically selfish and jealous want to help mortals achieve a higher state? When the tribunal murdered Nerevar and used the heart to achieve divinity, Azura got ticked but shouldn't that have been what she (and the other two ""good"" daedra) wanted in the first place?

My theory is that the teachings of these three to Veloth was a lie to begin with. The Deadra never wanted to teach the Chimer people how to see the tower, they were just jealous of Lorkhan's creation and not satisfied with their own creations and wanted Mortals to rule over. It doesn't seem out of character for the Daedra to lie to Veloth so they could have mortals to rule. You could take that as far to say that the Tribunal's murdering of Nerevar and using the heart of Lorkhan was to save the Chimer people from the whims Daedra.

Thoughts on this? Am I just misunderstanding history here? Seems it would be in the best interest of the Dunmer people as a whole to get away from the Daedra, especially Azura who seems to me to be one of the worst of them all.

This Weekly Community Thread comes a little late due to the fact I was preoccupied with watching big American men bash into each other and an equal amount of American women dance around, it was all quite fun. Anyways, I hope you all had a great week, we moderators certainly did enjoy this week, we didn't have to work too hard past removing a few comments and making a small PSA, so all's in good spirit.

This week we are continuing to see a sharp rise in the number of scholars, as well as more and more publicity in other subreddits (I'm pretty sure I saw some of you guys not only in /r/skyrim but in /r/games lately). The average number of users online at any given moment, I've observed, is also a lot larger. This week we also saw a great amount of activity, yet it seems that the number of threads is ever so slightly decreasing with the newcomers settling down and not rushing to post their questions. This means that more of you guys are reading the FAQ and the New Scholar's Guide, which I am very happy about. Thanks for that, now let's move on.

---

**Weekly Overview**

As I was saying, the amount of newcomers and publicity is bringing different trends to the subreddit every week. This week we've observed a very large amount of ""Confirm this idea/theory"" threads as well as a normally large number of question threads and discussions. Despite those two pretty much dominating the subreddit lately, we are still seeing some great explanation threads, such  as [The Revised Imperial Report on the Origin of the Sload, by Flavius Lupus, Synod Scholar](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17omee/the_revised_imperial_report_on_the_origin_of_the/) by B-rad-oleary, as well as [The Eight Stories of Y’ffre and the Eight Promises of the Bosmer](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17icta/the_eight_stories_of_yffre_and_the_eight_promises/) and [The Boiche: A Treatise on the Elves of Valenwood, Part I](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/17i9cl/the_boiche_a_treatise_on_the_elves_of_valenwood/), both by Lebiro.

Aside from that we are quickly shooting past the 8000 subscriber mark and heading for the 9000, with 211 new scholars this week. This number is a lot smaller than last week, but I have confidence that we are not losing track of our pattern of around 300-400 new subs per week that we have been getting lately. Once again I'd like to say welcome to all the newcomers that have arrived this week, welcome to the subreddit!

That said and done, let's move on to announcing the:

**Scholar of the Week**

This week we have a scholar who is (sadly) one of the only remaining active scholars that have been here since the start of the subreddit. In any case, this scholar has been a great member of our community since the start and is currently working on establishing his domain as /r/teslore's very own Bosmer Expert. Thank you for your continued activity, **Lebiro**, both this week and the weeks before, I do hope to see part 2 of your The Boiche threads soon, I know you've been working hard on it from your posts on Attrib.

---

That's it for this week, folks, thank you all for your activity. Once again I'd like to remind and explain to all the newcomers that the Community Threads are meant for anything non lore-related and are a free zone for any kind of comment or content. If you have any concerns or suggestions for the moderators you are also welcome to post it here.

Thanks everyone for your activity, hope all you American scholars like me had fun watching the Superbowl, whether it was for the ads, Beyonce, or the actual game, and also hope that all you non-American scholars had just as much fun this weekend as the Americans did. So keep on posting and discussing, scholars, and have a great week!

Originally I had thought to make this Community Thread Christmas themed, but since my Jewish self knows nothing about Christmas, might as well make just make it to celebrate all the holidays.

Anyways, it's also been a very good week, continuing the latest trend of lots of activity and high scholar-gain. So, before going into festivity and other such things, let's recap the week and choose a scholar of the week:

---

Well, as I have said before, the gain of new members is skyrocketing and there is lots of activity. Thank you for contributing to this, everyone, let's hope this trend does not stop and only improves. This particular week we have gained 119 scholars are now just over half-way to the next Big-round-number-milestone. With the influx of new scholars heading in, we are seeing mostly question threads which are all answered thoughtfully, but that did not stop great explanations and apocryphas from being posted as well. This week three threads stood out to me, those being [Constellations and the Lessons by RottenDeaditte](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1546io/constellations_and_the_lessons/), [Orsinium and the Orcs: After the Warp in the West by Myrrlyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/151r8r/orsinium_and_the_orcs_after_the_warp_in_the_west/) and [The Unburning Flame by Ishullanu](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14zif3/the_unburning_flames_proper_use_of_pyromancy/). Thanks for posting, everyone, and keep on doing what you do.

That's all for the weekly recap, before moving on to the Scholar of the Week here's an announcement brought to you by Starved:

---

The reddit admins have recently introduced a new reddit wiki system which allows users to create and edit their own wiki pages for a specific subreddit. This works in much the same way as Wikipedia and other similar sites, and comes complete with revision histories and talk pages. Currently, we're only using the wiki to store the FAQ and New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit in a more manageable format, but we'd like to know your opinions on the matter: what would you all like to see in teslore's wiki? The only real possibility we've been able to think up is a sort of ""Hall of Fame"" for exemplary posts, but we'd like to have more community involvement than that- tell us what you think!

---

**Scholar of the Week**

Tough pick this week, it is always kind of hard to pick one good scholar among so many that are just as active. This week, by what seems to be both overall activity and popular vote in the ""best of"" thread, the Scholar of the Week title goes to Scholar [RottenDeadite](http://www.reddit.com/user/RottenDeadite). Thank you very much for your activity and contribution, Rotten, it is about time you get the title.

Alright, with all the normal Community Thread thingamajigs said and done, it is Holiday Time! 

Instead of the normal casual Community Thread discussion in the comments, I urge everyone to try and go out of your personal bubble and tell us about yourself and your holidays. I believe /r/teslore is, in a way, one big family, and being with your family is much of the point of the Holiday season (Beyond Babylonians spoiling our candles, little baby Jesus being born, and the sun deciding that it hates everyone for one day).

So, do me a favor, tell me:

* How is your winter going?

* What holiday are you celebrating and with who?

* How said holiday is going/gonna go for you?

* What are you getting for said holiday

Personally my family has just finished celebrating Hannukah, enjoying visiting Jewish Americans and seeing just how horrifically wrong they celebrate our wonderful holiday and hysterically laughing at their poor attempts to sing in Hebrew. Seriously, I was over at another Jewish friend's house and they had a ""Hannukah Bush."" Also they gave each other presents. That's hilarious.

So yes, unlike the rest of the Jewish people around me, I for one got nothing for ~~Like Christmas but with more money~~ Hanukkah. What I did do though is go watch the Hobbit while the theater was empty since everyone was so busy getting their Christmas presents, and got to see it in a petty much empty theater (which was goddamn awesome). It's always good to go see the world where all fantasy lore derives from.

Alright, you heard me ranting enough, how is your holiday going? Don't leave me being the only one showing off here.

That is all I have to say for now, keep on posting and discussing, /r/teslore, and have a great Midwinter!

I have heard about a School called Mysticism (please, correct me if I spelled it wrong), which is the one preferred by the Psjiic Order (if I am not mistaken), and the Psjiiic monks hold immense respect and astonishing powers, so is it safe to conclude that thus the Mystics are the superior mages, or would a completely dedicated Illusion mage be able to receive the same power and respect?

Welcome once again to the Weekly Community thread, thank you very much for coming and reading along. In the last three weeks we have begun a streak of great amounts of activity and extreme loads of new scholars. This week was no different, we have had a continuation of the rise in amounts of posts per week, and are now just half way to the next subscriber milestone. This is a great start to what I think will be a future of a lot more activity and thus a greater sense of community.

If you are new to the subreddit and are wandering what in the Hist I'm doing ranting about the community, this is the Weekly Community Thread. These are intended to provide space for a free community discussion of non-lore related stuff both teslore related and otherwise. Here I do my best to summarize this week, as well as give unrestricted space for whatever the community wants to say. 

---

To go on to the weekly overview, as I have already written, /r/teslore has kicked itself into extreme activity, and we continue to gain lots of new scholars. Just this week we have gained 179 new scholars, a number which I and the rest of the moderators find truly amazing. 

As a result of the very much rising population, the subreddit is showing a trend coming back to what seems to be a place for much more general discussion. We have contrast between posts talking about the Amaranth and posts asking for more information about lesserly known races, both of which get continued activity and good discussion. This kind of trend was seen before, but seemed to have been slightly lost leading to the mindset that Elitism is a core part of /r/teslore, something that is completely untrue. What I'm getting at is that I'm thankful that we are currently as a subreddit restoring the non-elitist aspect of the subreddit and letting in newcomers with open arms, which is awesome. Thank you for that, and keep on doing it. 

Other than that we have a had a great week. Lots of activity, lots of discussion, and lots of good threads, including [The Common Khajiiti Mindset about Assimilation into Tamrielic culture by Mr_Flippers](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14l8r9/the_common_khajiit_mindset_and_the_assimilation/), [Role of the Blades leading up to the events of Skyrim by Dbcification](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14ojmd/the_role_of_the_bladesinhiding_leading_up_to_the/), and [Alternative View of the Tribunal by Strangeloup](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/14uixx/an_alternate_view_of_the_tribunal/)

Thank you for posting everyone, keep on going at it. It's great that we get so much activity, but it does come at the cost of steering quite a bit off topic forcing us mods to remove lots of comments lately, so we are sorry if you found your comment was removed. I'd like to just remind everyone again that posting and commenting in the subreddit itself is strictly lore related. The Community itself has *many* places to go for more casual and fun activity, including the community threads and the IRC (Which I am quite pissed off that no one uses. C'mon guys, Prince and I always feel lonely there. Join us.) as well as many smaller subreddits created by the community for the community. These smaller subreddits do serve a large role in the community, so it is important to mention and advertise them. To check those out you can go down in the sidebar. I've also been asked by Myrr to announce that he and some others plan on upgrading and using the network of so-far inactive race subreddits. Subreddits such as /r/argonians, /r/khajiits, and /r/orsimer suffer from almost complete inactivity. If the members of teslore could use these and populate them with good discussion and fun roleplaying, it would make both myrr and I happy.

With all things needed to be said aside, it is time to announce yet another

**Scholar of the Week**

This week was very hard to judge. The distribution of activity was pretty much evened out with all the scholars, and instead of getting a few regulars answer all the questions and post all the posts, we had hundreds of scholars go in and out of activity. Despite that, a user that stood out to me in activity was *Shonni-Et*. With seemingly twice the amount of the normal scholar this week, it seems only logical to give Shonni the award. Thanks for the activity, Shonni, and keep on posting!

---

That is all I have to say for this week. Remember that the part I write in the Weekly Thread is supposed to be only half of it, so I do not want to see inactivity in the comments. You are welcome and free to discuss whatever you want, and give suggestions as to what we should change or keep with the subreddit. You are also welcome to tell me about your week, I am interested.

That is all. Thank you for posting and commenting, scholars, never stop doing what you do, and have a great week.

As far as I know the rest of the empire was terrified of anything to do with Black Marsh during this time. Heck, the damage it caused was part of the reason Elsweyr had such a positive relationship with the first Dominion.

Further, we've got confirmation that players will be able to go to Stormhold in the Shadowfen, where the Flu was supposed to have originated. I don't think I'd feel very comfortable as an outsider (especially a Dunmer!) hearing the Argonians invite me to biological ground zero, especially after what happened to the Kothringi.

**Aetherius**

Aetherius is the home of the Magne-Ge. The Magne-Ge being the Aedra who followed Magnus and fled Mundus before being killed in it's creation. Aetherius is the originplace of Magicka and is a hotbed of Magne-Ge politics. 

**The Aedra**

The Aedra are the Et'Ada who aided Lorkhan in the creation of Mundus and gave their immortality to the creation of Mundus. Some became the Ehlnofey, the ancestors of Man, Mer and Akaviri, whilst others became the Earthbones, the laws of Natures. The most powerful ones however became the Plane(t)s, as can be seen here:

http://www.uesp.net/wiki/File:OB_Orrery_Planet_Names.jpg

Some argue that the Divines are dead and that what we see are just the echoes of them but in my opinion that's a non-point since it doesn't really matter either way because it doesn't change anything at all.

**The Aedric Realms**

We've never heard of any realm of the Aedra (except Sovngarde) and priests of Arkay commend the dead's souls to Aetherius. This leads me to believe that there is no such thing as an Aedric Realm and the souls of good and pious Imperials get sent straight into the Dreamsleeve.

**The Dreamsleeve**

The Dreamsleeve is the recycling system of souls. It is supposedly part of Aetherius but has also been said to be a part of Mundus, nothings been confirmed either way.

&gt; We mortals leave the dreaming-sleeve of birth the same, unmantled save for the symbiosis with our mothers

**The Daedric Realms**

Those souls who have bound themselves to a specific Daedric Lord go to their Plane upon death. There they serve their Prince for eternity.

**Sovngarde**

Is the realm of Shor, where valiant and heroic Nords feast for eternity. Many people believe it to be a part of Aetherius but I disagree seeing as Aetherius is the home of the Magne-Ge and that the Aedra are firmly stuck in Mundus (with the exception of the Aldmer who escaped). I've recently seen arguments as well for the idea that Sovngarde is a hero-filter on the Dreamsleeve. This, to me, sounds the most interesting of current theories but seeing as Bethesda hasn't said where Sovngarde is we can't really say.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

With all that said and done may I suggest a clean-up of UESP and ES wikia so that they no longer say Sovngarde is in Aetherius.

It is one of the other, disconnected kingdoms of which I mean to speak, however. Those of you who have studied the many plagues, such as the Knahaten Flu, will probably be familiar with the Thrassian Plague, the devastating disease that led to the eventual destruction of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, home of the Sload. I was granted special audience with a member of the Psijic Order recently who told me the story of the Sload creation myth, the ""K'Grua"" as they call it. It takes places during the Ehlnofex Wars, before the Men and Mer as we know them today came to be. It goes like this:
_____________________________________________________________________
*During a battle between the Ehlnofex armies, the Champion Trinimac paused from his rampage as he felt a strange and foul magic being woven throughout his forces. He looked over the battlefield, and his eyes fell upon a Necromancer, N'Gyre, as he called himself, and he watched briefly as N'Gyre began to raise up the broken bodies of his comrades.*

*At this most foul of injustices, Trinimac flew into a rage, approaching the Necromancer saying, ""Look at this, what atrocities you have committed! All this evil done with impunity, and a clear conscience on your part! You should bear the shame of a thousand betraying soldiers, for you fight not only through the use of others' power, but with the power of your own comrades!""*

*Hearing the rebuke, N'Gyre said, offended, ""Trinimac, you may be the Champion God of Lord Auri-El, but when you have passed your usefulness and begin to wither, there shall I stand, ready to rekindle the flame of your passion, but with my own choice fuel, that I may be your mind and body's master, and you will serve me on bended knee.""*

*Trinimac, growing ever more angered, pleaded with Auri-El for the permission to slay N'Gyre, and it was given. During the next battle, Trinimac found the Necromancer near the Coast and, before the Necromancer could successfully cast his spell, brought down all the might and rage of his great blade and slew N'Gyre. The strike of Trinimac's blade coupled with the energy of N'Gyre's charging spell sundered his body into many pieces, but the largest parts were cast into the Western Sea by Trinimac.*

*After Trinimac had departed, the foam from the sea and the sludge from N'Gyre's foul corpse mingled, and from this coagulation of mixtures, a vile, cruel, and proud race was born, the Sload. The pieces of N'Gyre that were too small to sink became the islands of the Coral Kingdom of Thras, and the energy of N'Gyre and his final spell lingered on, infusing necromantic power in each of the Sload from birth. They worshipped only N'Gyre, but were known to make pacts and deals with other Daedra Princes, like Namira and Peryite and Molag Bal, always with the intent of furthering their own potential as a means to an end, an end which is a well kept secret among the Sload.*

Also, I do not have the grammatical skill to sound like an actual scholar. Sorry about that.

Currently, we have agreed that all Towers, save the original two, were built by Elves, correct? Orihalc built by the Left-Handed Elves, Crystal-Like-Law built by the Aldmer/Altmer, White-Gold built by the Ayleids, ect. We also know that the Snow Elves, or the civilization that became the Snow Elves, turned the tallest mountain on Tamriel into a Tower. However, we still do not know the stone of Snow-Throat, which is odd because Bethesda has always made the Stone of a Tower a big part of the plot in all the Elder Scrolls games, except Daggerfall. 

So, following the pattern of the last 2 games, we should know what the Stone of Snow-Throat is. Some common theories are Alduin, Paarthurnax, the Nords, and the Eye of Magnus. I will strike each of these down, respectively.

* 1)	Alduin: Alduin sole purpose for even existing is to eat and destroy Mundus and all of creation to end the Kalpa. It doesn’t make any sense whatsoever for him to be a major force that is preserving Mundus.

* 2)	Paarthurnax: The PC is TES V: Skyrim has the choice to kill him. Which means he is expected to survive in some play-throughs of the game. If there is even a possibility for a Stone to remain intact or destroyed, it is not a Stone

* 3)	The Nords: The Snow Elves activated Snow-Throat before they even knew of the existence of the Nords, so they can’t be the Stone.

* 4)	The Eye of Magnus: This is the most likely of the common theories. But according to KIMMUNE, it might be a time-traveling, 9th Era, mining robot. This makes it unlikely that it is a stone.

Good. Now that we have got that out of the way, let’s go over some facts. Snow-Throat was the only natural, stationary Tower when it was created. This means that the Elves would just been able to scale the mountain and activate it, never wasting time on actually building the Tower.
 
The lack of building time leads me to believe that Snow-Throat was one of the first, Elven-made Towers that were created, alongside White-Gold and Crystal-Like-Law. This makes it possible that the Ancient Snow Elves understood the process of Tower creation better than some of the other Elves did when they built other Towers. Well, if the Snow Elves understood the process better, what’s stopping them from experimenting with the Stone? After all, they didn’t even have to worry about building the Tower. They could’ve taken all the time they needed to research how to make their Stone stronger than any physical substance. Something that is stronger than a substance is a concept.
 
We know that at least one kind of concept be made into a Stone. We see that with Convention. And lilrhys has basically proven that Convention was not just a onetime thing. It can be repeated. And the Elves’ God-King ascended with the aid of convention, so it seems that if the Elves couldn’t make Convention a Stone again, then they would try to make another concept the Stone. Preferably a concept closely associated with Auri-El. Time.
 
Time is a very strong force. It’s practically invincible. It is closely associated with their chief deity, there also seems to be more of a focus on time in the MQ of Skyim than there usually is in other TES games.

More importantly, the power of an Elder Scroll was used to rip through time and throw Alduin into the future **right on top of the tower**. Even if the first time the Elder Scroll was used only weakened time, well, the Dovahkiin used the same Elder Scroll on the exact same spot where time was weakened to view something from the past. This probably shattered Time, and with it, the Stone of Snow-Throat.

The main thing I like about this theory, is that it holds up the Theory that a Stone is broken in every TES game. 

Also, the only problem with this theory that I can think of is that time obviously still works after both Elder Scroll readings, but since Time is Akatosh’s domain, it probably can’t be completely destroyed without destroying Akatosh himself

Sorry if this was long. I wanted to right down my entire thought process on this.

Before I start, let me state that I have not yet played Morrowind but I own it and plan to play it not too far from now. Here's some of what I understood (correct me if I'm wrong please):  
-Lorkhan wanted to create Mundus for some reason, but for that he needed the help of many Aedra  
-He tricked/convinced them into helping him acheive creation (which makes him a padomic being), which in turn made them mortal/weaker/dead  
-Akatosh is mad, he makes a council and decides to kill Lorkhan  
-Trinimac tears Lorkhan apart (whose corpse becomes the moons) and Akatosh throws his heart in the sea (Becoming Red Mountain). Lorkhan is basically nothing more than a ""spirit""  
-Many heroes (men) appear through Tamrielic history that ressembles Lorkhan, those are the Shezzarines  
Now with that said, I have *a lot* of heavy lore questions:  
1- Why did Lorkhan want to create Mundus?  
2- Did he get weakened in the process?  
3- Why did Akatosh threw himself in Mundus instead of doing like Magnus and flee it?  
4- Did Akatosh help (without wanting to) Lorkhan by creating the first two towers and time itself?  
5- If Talos is the overmind of three of the Shezzarines, and the Shezzarines are Lorkhan's remains on Nirn, does that makes Talos Lorkhan?  
6- Was Pelinal a Shezzarine?  
7- I understood that Akatosh is kind of the elven god, so why did he gave the amulet of kings to a man? Especially since it was Lorkhan who made Alessia a saint...

Since this part of the lore is a mess to try and explain mistakes will be present.

As a preface, the (six) Walking Ways are essentially the paths to Godhood (and beyond) as set out in the 36 sermons of Vivec. The several different ""ways"" have been deduced differently but the Fourth is generally accepted as Mantling.

&gt;""The Stormcrown mantled by way of the fourth: the steps of the dead. Mantling and incarnation are separate roads; do not mistake this. The latter is built from the cobbles of drawn-bone destiny. The former: walk like them until they must walk like you. This is the death children bring as the Sons of Hora."" - [Nu-Hatta](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/nu-hatta-sphinxmoth-inquiry-tree) 

The Stormcrown (AKA Tiber Septim, Hjalti Early-beard, Talos) mantled by the fourth walking way which has been deduced as mantling. In order to mantle you must ""Walk like them until they must walk like you"" and Tiber did so by re-enacting (walk like) the King/Rebel Enantiomorph of Akatosh and Lorkhan. 

If we go by the Arcturian Heresy we can see that the Rebel in this case was Tiber (playing the part of Akatosh) and the King was Ysmir Wulfharth (who quite aptly plays the part of papa Shor) but which part does Arctus play? 

Some say he is playing Magnus, the observer, but I disagree since Magnus is the *observer* but he **doesn't** observe since Zurin murders Wulfharth. That is why I call him Trinimac, the knight. Trinimac is the one who kills Lorkhan in the creation myths and it is Arctus which kills Wulfharth.

As we all know, the lore that we all know and love is... flexible, to say the least. Almost every piece of information that we have received from history is merely from a single person's viewpoint, or as a product of their own research. As such, they can not be perceived as concrete facts.

However, there are a few central topics that figure heavily in the discussions on this subreddit, topics that perhaps not everyone is entirely aware of. While I am sure that the brilliant [FAQ](/http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/p5x2f/official_faq/) holds many of the answers, I personally consider the game lore to be the most direct source of information. Therefore, I propose to you a certain compilation: the most important books from within the game. A person who reads all of these books, when the compilation is finished, should have at least a solid foundation of lore knowledge.

To kick the discussion off, I propose three books: [The Arcturian Heresy](/http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Arcturian_Heresy), which details a possible but non-conventional origin of the Ninth Divine, Talos, [The Warp in the West](/http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Warp_in_the_West_(book), a series of reports regarding the aftermath of the Dragon Break, and finally [The Book of the Dragonborn](/http://uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Book_of_the_Dragonborn) for a more thorough understanding of the Dragonborn's role in Tamriel's history. 

I am sure that there are many other texts out there, which is where I need your help.

A travel Guide to Oblivion, the Outer realms, and what to do when you're there Version 1.0

Written by Dovahkiin42


[1] On Oblivion
	
When I talk about Oblivion in this guide, I am talking about both the daedric realms of Oblivion, including the well known ones such as Apocrypha and the Shivering Isles, as well as the otherwise considered “outer realms.” While little is known about the other Outer Realms, the basic travel concepts to get there can be the same as those to oblivion. Oblivion is a hostile and strange land. Many of the realms are inhabited by daedra, even an individual daedroth can be a formidable foe. First you will need to be accurately prepared. I recommend making sure that you are well trained in the combat magics for this purpose. However overall Alteration and Conjuration are what will get you to Oblivion. 

[2] Getting there and back safely.

[2.1] There are many who have claimed to have walked oblivion before. From the Hero of Kvatch to the ancient
 Dwemer, methods on going to oblivion differ. Here is a list of some known oblivion-walkers and their methods: Sotha
 Sil, used the dreaming cave of the psijics; Divayth Fyr, he is described to “simply to cease to be here, and begin to be
 there,” in reality it is discovered that he used a system of portals placed by a long forgotten telvanni wizard, presumed
 dead, his process was used by Morian Zenas. There are other methods that are not mentioned here, The Pillar of 
Thras is said to be one, there are lore references to a potion. Here I will talk about two methods I recommend,
 obtaining a sigil stone and making a pact with a daedric prince (I will talk about which princes I do and do not 
recommend), and where you could attempt to find someone who knows something about the telvanni method. 

[2.2] Before we begin, I would like to warn all potential scholars looking to pursue this method. It is not safe. Besides the necessary mastery of conjuration, I strongly recommend that you prepare yourself with a study on alteration and destruction. Rigorous physical training is probably a good idea as well. The reasons for knowing a good bit about destruction are obvious, and many of the realms you travel to will require complex breathing, warding, and levitation spells. Teleportation is a good idea to be familiar with as well. 
		

Now, the method that I am unable to personally tell you how to do due to a lack of knowledge on the subject is
 the Telvanni method. The Telvanni method will first require you to contact a prestigious member of the Telvanni house. I recommend the head of the house, however some telvanni wizard may be able to point you in a direction. It is uncertain if Seif-ij Hidja is still alive, because his book (the basis for much of my work on some of the plains) was around at least as early as the Oblivion crisis. 

The next method I am more familiar with. It involves a sigil stone. There are several ways to get a full blown sigil stone, or you can make one. To make one you must first purify the morpholith you are using. You must put it in a bowl, soaking in void salts, sitting on a four square table, and from dawn to dusk of the same day you must speak incantations over the stone. Then you take the purified morpholith and summon a daedric prince. The prince then can inscribe the stone, and you have a sigil stone (my apologies, I am going to step out of book writing mode now and apologize; I had the book open in the morning, however now I can't give you further reading on the subject in this volume). 

A third option would to directly summon a daedric prince, and ask them to open a door to their realm for you to enter and leave at will. This is a very dangerous idea. The daedric prince could choose to close his door at any time, leaving you and your party trapped in his realm of oblivion. I personally recommend this method, or that of the sigil stone because you could take a whole party of adventurers to improve safety.

[2.3] There are many things that you need to be cautious of while travelling to oblivion. I recommend that you 
only deal with one of the following princes: Sheogorath, Azura, Jyggalag, Sanguine, and Meridia. I recommend 
Sheogorath because of the known safety of his realm. It is decently well protected by the mad god, however I would 
be very careful trying not to go insane. Having a large group with you would be helpful here.


Azura is known to be one of the princes that is not completely evil. A warning to her realm though, it is known to be blindingly beautiful, and travelers there have said that it is “half blinding,” however it appears that her realm has been sealed after the trial of Vivec, and mages have been unable to travel there. Jyggalag seems to be an interesting daedric prince, he was expelled by the other daedra because of his great power. He is the prince of order, and I personally think that meeting him is a relatively safe endeavour compared to attempting to meet with Mehrunes Dagon or others. Caution should be taken when finding his realm however, little to none is known about his native plane. Sanguine is known to have treated mortals well in the past, beware his realms, where you just might get caught indulging too much. Meridia seems like a safe choice for a place to visit, little is known about her, however she is known to assist mortals that kill undead, so having necromancers or vampires in your party may be a bad idea if traveling here. 

[3] Dangers of Oblivion
1. Make sure to have skill in levitation, magical breathing (water and otherwise) in case you land in a realm that does not have adequate air or land to use. 

2. Have knowledge in conjuration, if you happen to be attacked by a group of golden saints, an unbound dark seducer could prove a handy distraction
3. Be wary of the daedric princes, they do not have your best interests at heart. If possible I would attempt to meet with a prince if you plan on staying in their domain
	
There are a wide variety of daedric realms that you need to concern yourself with, I recommend deep study into each planned stop. For many of the readers of this will be mages, I recommend having a partner conjuror stay on mundis for safety purposes. In case of emergency, the nirn based conjuror could summon you unbound adventurer and all will be well. In order for this to work you will need to develop a psychic relationship with the other person. Several notable groups have developed this, including the Dwemer and Psijics. Each realm has dangers. Perhaps I will write a sequel that contains the dangers of each major plane. 

---

Authors note: there are some experiments and miscellaneous things that I would like you to try when you reach oblivion. They are: try summoning someone on nirn to Oblivion as they would summon you to nirn, if you ever encounter the dwemer on some plane, please let the world know, If you have another way to reach oblivion, please write me with details and I will put it in the edit, If you find a way to create your own plane of oblivion contact me and I will work on a guide.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1374351029.0,,Dwemer,True,t3_1ij8e1,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1ij8e1/a_travel_guide_to_oblivion_the_outer_realms_and/,

Welcome to yet another Weekly Community Thread. Partly in order to insure that you read through the entire thread and partly (upon Mr. Boeathia's command) to torment you as much as possible, I will put the big announcement of the New Moderator at the bottom of the thread (muhahaha). Seriously, though, do read the entire thread, don't just scroll down to the announcement. If you do it will put a big hearty smile on my face.

**Weekly Summary**

I have to say this week was very enjoyable as it was one of the most active weeks I remember us having to this date. With almost two pages of threads, each one with a large amount of comments, you guys really did do good this week. I was very proud to see. There isn't a specific large or Apocrypha-type thread to mention this week as far as I remember, but it's fine since you guys will get plenty of those when the 12,000 scholars mark rolls around. 

In addition to the activity we have also gotten a fresh wave of new scholars, precisely 150 this week, so welcome to all the new scholars. If you are new, make sure once again that you have read through the sidebar and the New Scholar's Guide to the Subreddit, as well as the FAQ before you start posting. Make special notice to re-read the voting guidelines even if you have already done so.


**Scholar of the Week**

This week's scholar of the week is new to the title, yet I am unsure of how new to the subreddit. While certainly active in past weeks and threads, this week /u/Asotil has been especially active and has made an appearence in most threads this week. So congratulations, Asotil, hopefully the others in the SOTW hall of fame can welcome you warmly.

**Announcement**

As you all probably know, last week we held elections for moderatorship of /r/teslore. We got nominations for three great scholars, those being /r/myrrlyn, /u/anonymous_mononymous, and /u/OccupyTamriel. After seeing some comment support in the original thread, we decided to put the voting down to a poll, to which we have gotten over a hundred votes (more than last time)

Out of those votes, over 50% of the votes went to **/u/OccupyTamriel**, so we would like to welcome OT to the Elder Council. OT will begin duties soon, meaning we will use him as our personal comment-removal servant for a while before letting him actually do anything else, it should go pretty well.

As for the other candidates, I am sorry for your loss in the elections. Personally, and I am sure the other moderators think just the same, I believe all three of you would have made equally great additions to the moderation team, but the community decides what it decides.

---

That's pretty much it for this week, feel free once again to do whatever it is that you would like to do in the comments, as well as to introduce yourself if you are new.

Thank you very much for your activity, scholars, and I hope you have a great week!

I never read all of the Trans-Cyrod Insurgency (52 damn pages man, I'm not made of free time), but does anyone think that it's along the same line or appears to be set in that same area/time/kalpa/work of fiction as the whole Boma Kuro deal (although I don't believe that occurred in the 4th Era).

So anyway, here you can post whatever you make of this, since I'm not sure I can do it alone at this time of night (currently 11:57PM). I'll probably edit this too anyway as I come up with half-brained theories

I have been reading some of the more metaphysical texts and was wondering two things on DragonBreaks. I've heard a break described as all frames of a movie being played all at once, so all of time is happening simultaneously. So when Vivec stood on Red Mountain did he see everything that would be or were there also possibilities that never came to fruition. So did Vivec see the CoC and also what would happen if Dagon was successful or just things that definitely would happen? This also raises the question, when a DragonBreak occurs is this all of time only from the current kalpa? And lastly what determines the length of a break? The on brought about by the Marukhati was 1008 years long yet the Warp in the West was 2 days.

I think I have finally found a link when reading into the Vampiric cure discussion thread:

Lets look at the clues:  Soul Gems are a common ingredient in all TES games/lore in search for a cure to Vampirism.

*Galur Rithari was to fetch cursed soul gem of mysterious nature from a deep cavern on the northern slopes of Dagoth Ur (Morrowind reference)
*The champion of Cyrodil had to get 5 special grand soul gems.
*Skyrim - A black soul gem. 

2nd important clue:  Vampires don't need to be soul trapped to enter the Cairn. 

3rd Clue: [Thanks to Nokutisu](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/1anl7d/morrowind_vampirism_cure/)
""I see you have done as I asked, little vampire. It was not easy for me to obtain the cure, but I was able to pry it from Vaermina after some...discussion [...]""

Vampires are a Molag Bal jurisdiction, but he had to go to Vaermina for this so it doesn't make sense or does it?  Unless Vaermina has something to do with the souls in the Soul Cairn. If this is the case then there is a business relationship between Molag Bal and Vaermina regarding the Soul Cairn.  Also perhaps they are the Ideal Masters, or the ones who the Ideal Masters answer to in exchange for their powers.

They have common rivals, similar goals, but they have different 
desires* which don't directly interfere with eachother.  

Any thoughts?

(Foundational document of old-as-earth Altmeri edaphological philothea, submitted in tribute to all you sundered lovers out there. We feel ya.)




[Dear love,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtHCBJV5KQc)


The dawn is beautiful, is it not? The horizon. The sun. The soil. Our rumpled cheeks. The dew. The dew, the salted dew, is beautiful. So often we deny that. So often I have denied that. Or not seen it. But the dew is beautiful. The dew is beautiful.



I wanted to write this letter because I have something to share with you. We get to share so few things in this world. I didn’t always care – I didn’t always want to share. I ran away. I ran away from the earth of my life and learned of other horizons, but those entanglements were ungrounded by the lack of you; I was a sinkhole in reserve. But these last few months – it has been like an awakening, a healing of a wound I didn’t know I had. I cut off part of myself and I cut off part of my capacity for life, and I only knew it when you brought it back to me. You gave me all the worlds of Not and taught me the joy of their present absence without doing anything at all. I want to give that back, if I can. I want to give you what I feel.



There’s no guarantee that I can. I’m not sure that it will work. I’m not sure the answer that has found me these last few months will be anything new to you. Maybe you found this long ago. Maybe you never forgot it. Maybe it has no merit at all. I do not know. I am as uncertain of this as I am of everything in life – and I am uncertain of everything in life. Everything I have learned from you in the last decade distills to this: I know nothing. Even about myself, I know nothing. I have no foundation in the indubitable. Have you ever felt unfounded? Or have you forgotten in full the embrace of discrepancy and possibility? Are you, my senary sibling of Not, assured in refusal of your world? Or does your every opinion ring false in your own ears, as do mine in my own, undercut by understanding? 



I see your skeptical eyebrow, my Mother, and raise you a confession: my vehemence is little more than a mask for my heart’s [niggling seed of self-identity with the things I denounce](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUm9jnBCM4c). Reason is only a tool, and like all tools issues only the product of its wielder's skill and resources. Logic is promiscuous; it invests validity in contradictory stances. I have no confidence in debate, although I engage in it. I am not certain of anything... not even the truth of that statement. I – I am not even sure that I should send this letter. It seems – presumptuous. Arrogant and foolish. But this feeling - it is all the richness of possibility compressed to a single point of poignance. How could I not want to share that with you? How could I not try to give that to you? So I do it, though I am not sure that I should.



It may seem strange. I, the Solitude, writing of sharing and love? It is almost ridiculous. But although I have gone from you and kept no company on the road of purpose, I am neither loner nor lonely. [Solitude, like the solar, is food, just as togetherness is food, for they are only truly different in gradient](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrGEyk5Mp2g). We are all many people; to be alone is to be with our Selves. Solitude is only subgradient togetherness; togetherness is only shared solitude. And as I have feasted upon solitude, now I wish to share. So, please do not find this letter too strange. I speak little, but feel much.



[So often we live in dreams](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIeLeIwwpHc). We see so many things that could be, so many things that we want to be, but are Not. We dwell on them, cherish them, treasure them up, and mourn them when they seem to pass irretrievably into impossibility. Sometimes it seems that they aren’t worth it. To see so much beauty and experience so little of it is unendingly painful. I used to think that there could be no love without pain, pain came so often. When you drained the blood from my affection and offered only the dust of the dead in return, there has been pain. When you could not accept disparity, there has been pain. When you held back, thinking that I wanted more than you could give, even though all I wanted was to be there for you where there had been no one for me, there has been pain. There has been pain in restraint and impossible dreams. Even with you, my Mother, [there has been pain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f_5LUf10L0): we began with all the pain of the world. All the world shares this. Every dawn dehisces.



But not all the world remembers its tragedy. So many choose amnesia. And sometimes even we would rather forget it, both the pain of its end and the joy of its intimacy; sometimes even we would rather forget that we ever knew such togetherness, because it [seems like we can never have it again](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXD3StsKCJk). Sometimes it seems that we should just turn aside from love and dreaming all together, that we should rather feel nothing than endure this absence.



But I have tried that, and found it impossible. I refused the unreal , but the unreal still came to me. [You still came to me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyJjihseiio). And I learned that what I thought was pain was not pain at all. I thought it was absence I felt. It wasn’t. It isn’t. It is the *presence* of absence. It is the *indwelling of the unreal*. It is an approximation of actuality. In some way, although unreal, the things for which we yearn are *actually present* in our longing. Shared solitudes that *are Not* enter into us, and we know them by the void their presence presses into our hearts. The fullness of the presence of absence is what makes the tears flow in the dark, not pain. The intimacy of our missing dreams fills us, fills us to overflowing, and when we cry with longing, we cry *because we are full*.



That is not pain. That is beauty. That is the kiss of the missing. That is the condensation of possibility; that is the dew of dawn. [Your tears are the golden dew of dawn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F29AOOgvVOU). When I think of life without that – when I think of what my life would be without our shared solitude rearing mountains in my heart, without our fungus-raids spreading forests in my palms, without our fluorescence-knit fingers on vellum, without the fur of n-plus-one-pets-needed Nell on our skin, without these long nights of longing, these long nights of longing for love and longing to give you these riches I cannot appreciate - ah, my love, my love, that is when I feel absence. That is emptiness, and a life not truly lived.



I once told you that I would not miss you – not out of cruelty, although it was cruel, but out of simple disdain for the feeling. Well, I have learned to miss, my love, and I have learned to love missing. And I miss you.



I have to. I have to remember, I have to long for hallucination, I have to yearn for silly dreams and imagination, I have to miss you, because in missing you, I have you. [For even to think of you is golden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShFer_hFZxs). I have to live like this - missing, yearning, longing, wanting you *so much* – because it keeps you with me when you are gone. And you are always in some measure gone.



This is the most important part. There is so much pain and separation in this world; even the most intimate of friends never truly touch. [And we long to, my love, you know that we do](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ96v7hAbvw). We all do. We crave it instinctively, holding to the fragments of our first memory of intimacy, our first shared solitude, our nascent dawn to this world. But if we ever want to touch, if we ever want to feel that dawn again, then we have to live like this. We have to cry, we have to miss, we have to remember, because our memories of intimacy entangle reality.



But I hold no confidence that my telling can convince those who are forged, as I was, those who are aching, as I was, those who are weary, as I was. That will not give you what I feel. You must feel it yourself. It is not enough to speak of what can be done; we must also speak of how.



It is very easy. Simply ask. Simply wonder. Simply say 'I do not know.'



Confusion is the key. Love lasts only as long as we approach our beloved. We must yearn toward them. [Love is the perpetual approach](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYAn6bMgqVs); we cease to love when we stop going to our beloved. When we think we know our loves discretely, concretely, precisely, we stop coming closer to them - for why should we strive toward what we think we already have? It is such an easy thing to fall into. But love is understanding, and to understand is to become: a process. It is the reconstruction of pattern, not pattern's presence. We are all waves of diachronic identity - oscillating, infinitive, inexact - and those we love are our functional asymptotes. We perpetually approximate our beloved. But when we choose the evaluation of certainty, when we think we know, we suspend ourselves a discrete distance from attainment; the wave resolves in failure. Thus, to practice confusion opens us to possibility, to the Could inherent in Not, and to love. It is in the word itself. Confusion: with fusion. With the Coming-Together. With love. To be confused is to be with love. 



Put technically:



*The limit of correlation between the real and the unreal is the degree of the system’s uncertainty.*



This is the boundary of possibility: the less we know, the more we can understand. The less we know, the more we can feel the unreal. The less we know, the more we can kiss the missing. The less we know, the more we can love.



See it thus: Uncertainty is the seat of understanding. Confusion is the throne of love.



And when you sit in that seat the feeling comes. When you practice confusion absence becomes present; then comes the indwelling of the unreal. It is the taste of lemon and butterscotch. It is the feeling of a too-large idea stretching your skull in the night. It is the welling of saliva. It is the catch of your throat in a sob. It is your mouth filled with earth. It is dew. It is the cusp of orgasm given gravidity. It is the kiss of the missing. It is the sound of a swallowed syllable. And that is the only name I have found for it: NM; the acronym of our starry browed merge-Masters; the swallowed syllable, the forever-nascent sound of all the things I have wanted to say to you.



I don't know if you want this. I don't know if NM will be as powerful for you as it has been for me. I don't know if this is what you would want me to do. I had to try, though. There is too much in me not to share. I overflow for you. I had to try. I'm not sure that it will work. Perhaps this has all just been - tedious. Obvious. Obtuse. Underwhelming. I don't know. [It has been growing inside me for so long](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgsuAUuMxFw). It was so hard to hold back until the proper day. And in some ways... maybe it would have been better if I had not waited. I did not know that it would be like this. In other ways... well, perhaps it is better that this reach you now. I hope that it brings you the comfort and wonder it has brought me. In all ways, though, it is done. I have told you what I have to tell, and shown you what I have to show. It is up to you to accept the gift, if you will. 



If you will, then remember what I have said. Do not choose amnesia. Remember. Remember the boundary of possibility: the less we know, the more we can understand. Remember that uncertainty is the seat of understanding. Remember that confusion is the throne of love. And when that confusion brings you to NM, remember that it is not pain you feel but fullness. If you long for hug after hug after hug, as I do, if you yearn for a kiss in the night, as I do, if you hope for what can never be, as I do, if you want someone *so much*, as I do, remember that [even to think is golden](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nZGv8VTBVE).



If you cry for what is Not, remember that your tears are the overflow of the unreal, the condensation of possibility, and the dew of dawn.



If life sunders you from the sharers of your solitude, remember to kiss the missing.



And if ever you miss me, remember that in missing me, you have me.

Goblin are short stout creatures, often quite nimble. They have darkish green skin, similar to that of the Orsimer and ogres. They typically wield smaller arms and light armour, typically consisting of make-shift pieces scavenge from their kills. Their leaders strength however, allows them to fight with heavier weapons.

Rieklings are of similar skeletal structure and I theorize that they are related. Examination reveals a remarkably similar cranial structure. To support my hypothesis, Rieklings have small knobs of bone protruding from their skull, similar to the bones within goblins pointed ears. Rieklings are believed to be descended from the Falmer, but are sometimes referred to as “snow goblins”. I believe both of these races are devolved Mer of some sort.

Whilst orcs, gremlins and ogres are also categorised as Goblin-ken, they bear few physical similarities.

**Behaviour**

Goblins exhibit a hostile behaviour, frequently attacking strangers. Within in their lairs, gold can be found, indicating that they have some notion of currency. Goblins normally band into tribes which war over their totems. One of the most famous is the war between the Rock Biters and the Bloody Hands of Cyrodil. The Rock Biters stole the Bloody Hand's totem. The war ended after the death of the Bloody Hand shaman or the returning of the staff. This allowed the settling of Cropsford.

Their religion is unknown. The shamans show some form of worship, but to who, or what, is unknown. Malacath, the corrupted form of the Mer, Trinimac (I believe), is considered a patron god of the ostracised, including the Goblin-ken. The warring over the possession of the staffs is intriguing.

The tribes themselves are formed of different types of foot-soldiers, and are lead by a shaman, who knows primitive magic, and a war chief. Sometimes the tribe is lead by an ogre. Goblins seem to communicate through high-pitched squeals. Goblins can also tame Durzogs. Some argue that the Durzogs are more intelligent than the goblins.

The third edition of Pocket Guide to the Empire states that the Aldmer kept goblins and other Goblin-ken as slaves. After being freed, sometime during the 2nd century of the 9th era, they founded Orsinium near High Rock.

**Distribution**

Goblins are found all over Tamriel, but seem to prefer the underground, most dwelling in abandoned mines and caves, only emerging to hunt. Some have been found roaming the sewers, feeding on skeevers. Perhaps centuries of being shunned has led them to hide underground.

From your humble servant and friend, Malvius,


It has been a long while indeed since my last letter. I trust this one shall find you in good health? Old Mede isn't working you too hard, I hope.

I may have stumbled on something quite intriguing indeed, but I leave it to your capable mind to take care of the publishing, if indeed you should want to. I'm afraid that what I've learned, or think I've learned, won't make very many citizens happy indeed. Still, I owe it to you to report back, as you graciously continue to finance my journey. 

Where to begin? I've learned so much, it has become difficult to collect my thoughts. I suppose I should start with my oldest discovery. It's not likely to make very many of my kin happy, nor indeed many of the Nords. You'd think a good Bosmer like myself would be outraged and scandalised by it, but I suppose the finder of hidden truth is exempt from such things. But enough beating around the bush (what a curious phrase, I quite enjoy it). On to the heart of the subject.

I was walking through the Great Pine Forest of southern Skyrim recently. It's quite beautiful, and there's little chance of angry agents from the Dominion coming after me that far north, so my mind was at ease. You simply must visit sometime. Anyway, as I said, I was walking through the forest, and I came upon a glade. The common tongue doesn't quite have a phrase for its beauty, and my own tongue would not translate to paper well, but suffice it to say, it was the single most breath-taking sight my humble eyes have ever taken in. Simply wonderful. 

There was a lovely little pond where tiny fish swam about doing fish things, and on its banks, a small tree that looks as if it had come out of Valenwood. Indeed, I believe it had, and again, the weaknesses of language confound us, for I cannot render its name here. I shall have to speak it to you when we meet face-to-face again, for it is most lovely. 

Back to the glade, though. There were birds singing merrily from its branches, and the grass was cool to the touch. The sunlight filtered through the tree tops, and I felt like singing. 

Unfortunately for me, I got a little too free with myself, and a rather angry creature walked out of the tree, much to my surprise. I heard the hunters in the quaint little lodge I stayed at after this business was concluded call it a Spriggan when I recounted my tale to them, so I suppose that's what it was. A fair forest nymph it appeared to me, though it began to attack me, believing me a threat. It was no animal, of that I am sure, for there is no beast in all of Skyrim that would attack a lover of the forest like myself unprovoked. This Spriggan, then, came at me, and unfortunately I had to dirty my blade.

I cast the poor creature down there, marring the glade. I cleaned my blade in the grass, and bent over the fallen body, only to notice some small details that sparked my curiosity. Its limbs looked as though they were bones and roots, bones like those of any man or mer, and roots of, well, trees. Its head was crowned with branches that whistled with the sound of winds long gone, and its face was radiant with beauty. Truly it rivaled even that of this glade it defended!

As I stooped over it and studied, the creature suddenly sprang back to life, grabbing me by the throat! I didn't recall anything from beyond that point until I woke up until much later.

I was lying along the side of the road, naked, and very cold. The first thing I noticed was a woman with a kindly face standing over me. She looked human enough, though I suppose she was Breton, for her face had elven grace to it mixed with the rough dependability of the Nords. She was garbed in the vestments of the Temple of Mara far off in Riften, and reached her hand down to pull me up. After getting me to my feet, she gave me a robe from her pack, for it seemed she had traveled somewhere on Temple business, and was returning back that way.

I tried to question her on what happened, but she wouldn't speak. She only smiled, and walked on. I soon lost her along the road, and reached a dusty little village, near the border with Cyrodiil. I purchased a room and retired for the night. While I slept, I dreamed, and this dream seemed for all the world to be real, perhaps the most real thing I'd encountered on this long journey of mine.

I dreamed I was watching myself stand over the fallen Spriggan. I saw the hand shoot up to my throat, and saw as my body was thrown up and into the pond. 

Then, to my shame, my body changed. No Bosmer openly speaks of this, but we all have in us the nature of every beast and creature to ever roam this world, and many who have not yet done so. We only use this power in times of great need, for we swore an oath to restrain this great and evil power we have to our greatest patron, the god Y'ffre. He made with us a great Pact, of which I will not speak further for now. But, back to the dream.

Yes. I lost control of my body, and it changed freely as we once did before Y'ffre sacrificed himself into the earth. It ran loose and wild, and I'll not speak of it further either. Eventually, as dawn broke, it emerged onto the road, where I saw the priestess when I woke up. Only the priestess was not who I saw.

I saw the most radiant woman imaginable, war-like in full armor, yet the kind face remained. The wind was in her winged helm, and she commanded me to stop in a loud voice. She bade me change no more, and return to my original form. And my body obeyed.

...it seems clear to me now that the woman I met on the road was none other than Kyne, the Nord god. But her actions seem strange. If she is the ruler of the air and the rain, how did she command me to return to the bounds within the Pact? And why was her form fair elven when I saw it with waking eyes?

This leads me to the first, and arguably the worst, of my learnings. Kyne is the mother of the Nords, and is also Kynareth, the lady of the air. This much is known. But, after my strange encounter, I believe that Kyne is Y'ffre, or Y'ffre is Kyne, or perhaps they are each other, for only Y'ffre can call us out of the terrible forms we assume when we invoke the Wild Hunt. This proves disturbing, but oddly fitting, considering the love each god has for nature and growing things.

My second learning, and one of only minor importance, has to do with the Spriggans. As I write this, my mind turned to our sacred Pact with Y'ffre. None live who remember all of it, but consider this: love of nature is common among Bosmer. What better way to love and commune with nature than to become it? I think that sometime in the forgotten past, Bosmeri maidens invoked Y'ffre, and begged to be one with nature. Y'ffre took pity on them, and changed their form. I believe these maidens, formerly my kin, are the Spriggans of today. As for how they came to protect the forests and growing things of northern climes? Perhaps Kyne asked them to guard all forests, not just our homeland's forests, if indeed Kyne is Y'ffre.

As an aside, I do wonder what this says for our gods. If Kyne is Y'ffre, could other gods be two sides of the same coin as well? What a dreadful thought!

I gladly rid myself of these troubling thoughts now, though rest assured, noble Erivir, I shall have more soon enough. May the gods, whose names may change, but whose natures never shall, keep you in good health and in good standing with all you meet.

I leave this letter in your capable hands,

We are now fast approaching both the New Year and a 7000 scholar milestone, so it certainly is a good time for the subreddit. I have mentioned in the earlier Community Threads how the subreddit is on a sort of Golden Age, gaining surprising amounts of new scholars and getting great amounts of activity, and this theory continues to prove itself correct. With 34 posts and 168 new scholars, this has been one of the subreddit's busiest weeks in a while now. By this rate I should be making the next thread a milestone thread, which is damn awesome. Keep on posting, guys, this is amazing.

**Weekly Recap**

This week we have seen a mix of general question-discussion from the influx of new members, as well as some great Apocrypha and explanation-style threads from older regulars. Among my favorite threads this week were [The Altmer misconception by Bambikins](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15ivy1/xpost_raltmer_the_altmer_misconception/), [Conjecture on the Codes of Malacath By Myrrlyn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15j34k/conjecture_on_the_codes_of_malacath/), [""From the deserts of rust and wounds to Camoran's paradise"" a translation and interpretation of the Mysterium Xarxes by Rileyman360](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15gbha/from_the_deserts_of_rust_and_wounds_to_camorans/), [A Boy and his Dog by Voryn](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15g8qz/a_boy_and_his_dog/) and [Virtue, Ever Watchful: Part the Seventh- Deceit by Dbcification](http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15f1bx/virtue_everwatchful_part_the_seventh_deceit_merry/). All great threads this week. 

So in overall, great week, lots of activity, and many new scholars. Everything good and joyous. Except one small thing. We have been getting a very underwhelming amount of votes for the [Best of 2012 poll](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WPP55CK). Which makes Rhys and I very sad. So, let's stress this more:

[**GO VOTE. SERIOUSLY. NOW. DO IT. FOR ONE MOMENT JUST PUT DOWN THAT 5TH ERA LOVELETTER AND GO VOTE. YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO HAVE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU VOTE FOR, JUST DO IT. SERIOUSLY GUYS.

That is all. Let's move on to the 

**Scholar of the Week**

Our scholar of the week this week has far too much activity to pass over. Aside from basically running the TSG/TAG subreddits, and posting in our subreddit very actively in the last few weeks, this guy has just been as close to a community manager as possible outside of the Community Threads. I know this guy, he's going to complain that he got the title, that selfless bastard, but that's okay. He still got it. Congratulations, [Myrrlyn](http://www.reddit.com/user/myrrlyn), keep at it, and thanks for the continued activity. Also this may or may not have to do with the fact he got me Reddit Gold. I'm corrupt like that, such is the nature of the An-Xileel.

That's all I have to say this week. Once again,

If you are a new scholar, say Hi and introduce yourself. We'd like to get to know you.

And, if you are nice, [Go Vote](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/WPP55CK). 

If you are a lurker and have not shown any actual activity, now's the time, do introduce yourself, too.

Other than that feel free to tell me about your week and provide any feedback you have for the mods, and also feel free to do anything. This is The Community Thread, it's purposefully politely anarchistic. 

That's all I have to say. Keep on posting everyone, and have a great week.

We're seeing the fractured end result of many different cultures compiling what they feel are relevant, applicable, irrefutable, or religiously appropriate ""truths"" that have been haphazardly passed on via word of mouth or unsourced text. The jumbled and confusing lore is not a product of a broken system it is an ironically accurate representation of the world that it exists in. This leads me to my question...

Had the Dwemer, a significantly more technologically developed and scientifically driven people, actually survived until the current events of the fourth era how do you feel it would effect the lore and generally accepted facts of TES universe? Would they be able to apply a form of ""scientific method"" that would lead to more concrete conclusions? Would they have descovered undeniable laws of nature/divinity/cosmology?

**A boy and his dog**


Many an end and beginning ago,
There once was a boy and his dog,
one day strolling by a log,
far from the village and through the fog.

shortly acquainted, swiftly friends,
the two had saved each other from many ends,
but from what came next,
of no vigil nor valiance had they been blest

for a thing not quite man and not quite wolf
leapt forth, eyes wild, fangs bared, and gripped the dog.
And in bloody strife, their mirth and bond did it engulf.
But for the sun, the victim would not have been relinquished

Wrapped in interim of far night and early day,
the boy weeped, not an inkling of once-joy within his bones.
At this bitter misfortune he mourned and lamented as the dog ebbed to his final dusk.
He cried and begged for any and all gods unravel this callous end.
No peace came from beyond the stars, no salvation, no voice.
Save one

""Forsooth terrible was the misfortune that coerced you here.
Your agony I know, yet I could put it in a throe,
for nothing but a single condition, shall the wound go""

The boy knew of the voice, daedroth was its kin.
Old and mischevious and dispassionate.
Save for its lust of mischief.


Betwixt pain and grief, the boy could no longer reason.
""From dusk to dawn shall he be?""
""And more, but never again shall he bring you the comfort he once did,
hindrance and vexation to your every doing.""

First by pain and grief,
and soon by powers beyond belief,
shall the boy's judgement ever be veiled.
Readily he agreed, so ruination thus curtailed, 
heart brimming with joy, he did not yet know,
his soul defiled to the very crux.

With every heart-beat didst the dog grow warmer,
and the boy, colder.
For none too soon were they home,
that the boy developped a taste for devilry.
So much so that he relished it with great gusto.
Yet as the word of daedroth stated
the dog always attempted to halt what the boy plotted.

So did it go, one schemed, the other foiled.
And for many years did this persist
Early was it that the fisherman cursed the bear for his interfering
so it was his door unlocked and honey trailed up to his bed
Fortune or mis was it that the tax-collector's bag bled?
Or that the lumber-jacks before tree-wives had fled?

Keener didst the boy's mind grow,
ears athirst for knowledge,
eyes hungering for happenstance,
and many gardens of misery did he tend,
with the dog as his sole torment.

Wily and insidious was now the boy.
So saturated and enraptured by his work,
that the dog's rescuer had come with an offer.

Delighted and engrossed with the boy,
the daedroth offered him a place by his side,
to do as he does, here, there,  and by all the five corners.


The boy pondered but knew, what terms must now be struck?
the voice cackled and seemed to grin behind its star-void veil;
""trifle and trivial, paltry and slight, all you must do, is take the dog too,
forever to be a part of you"".


Flustered and rattled, the boy considered.
But soon with a frown-cloaked-smile, joined the prince in oblivion,
and so stood he then, at the foundation of apotheosis.


Not for a day did he linger,
and swiftly he came to every prayer.
Whether cursed or praised, he left by giving his name,
replacing and usurping his master's fame

But also higher now than normal man,
the dog enjoyed a new consciousness,
and weaving reason into his own canvas.
He knew to not now trouble the boy,
for he knew his ambition
and better was he for that which was his intention.
All the dog could bring was admonition

The boy toiled diligently, and skillfully,
weaving lies of his power wedded to promises of rewards,
but for loyalty and the dissemination of his name

And soon, the boy's rubric, and not the daedroth's
was the one recognized as lord of wishes.
Too late did the prince realize,
the boy's power exceeded his own.

So it is said that the boy tore out the face of the quondam prince,
and claimed it and plane and power as his own.

Prince unto void,
Boy unto prince

but it became his game.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,1356494839.0,,Armigers,True,t3_15g8qz,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/15g8qz/a_boy_and_his_dog/,

1354165786.0,23,self.teslore,13z8w5,The Dreamsleeve as a Means of Communication,Ishullanu,24,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/13z8w5/the_dreamsleeve_as_a_means_of_communication/,"

 The Dreamsleeve as we currently understand it has two seemingly unrelated functions. Mainly it serves as a mechanism for recycling the mortal souls of Nirn, but certain magically inclined individuals have found an unknown way of using the Dreamsleeve to relay undetectable messages. The purpose of this writing is to explore the link between these two aspects of the Dreamsleeve, the advantages of using it to communicate, and finally how the mages could be accessing it.

 For the Dreamsleeve to serve its purpose of reincarnation it must be able to both take in and let out souls anywhere in Mundus. It would need to be accessible under nearly all circumstances, unblocked by magical interference. It is easy to see why this would be appealing for those who wish to discretely send information across vast distances. Instead of having the message pass through possible magical and physical protections the mage sends the message out of Mundus, for it to travel undetectably through this other realm, reentering the world at the exact intended destination.

So the benefits of Dreamsleeve messaging are clear, more opaque is the specific process used to gain these abilities. It seems highly unlikely it is accomplished by the opening of portals into the Dreamsleeve, not only would that be very difficult but if a Dreamsleeve portal was opened it would reasonably be used for much larger purposes than communication, considering the amount of power (soul energy) and knowledge (purged memories) that consistently pass through there. For a mage to use the Dreamsleeve it would be logical to assume they would mimic the natural conditions of something passing into it, specifically with death. 

Now as with most magical processes, it may not be necessary for this to be literal. Perhaps combined with ritualized intent and magical energy the symbolic destruction of a written letter would imitate death closely enough to send the the message through the Dreamsleeve. It could be even simpler, only requiring a mental composition to be pushed out of ones consciousness with appropriate preparation and direction, the death symbolism coming from the loss of the unique composition from one’s mind, for it to appear reincarnated in another’s. Obviously, it is not know if these rituals would be enough to penetrate into the Dreamsleeve system, more direct approaches may be necessary with unpleasant implications. 

The most plausible way to access the Dreamsleeve for communication is to bind the missive directly to an unremarkable mortal’s soul, then to extinguish the mortal’s life. Some additional protection would need to be afforded to the information to survive the natural purging manner of the Dreamsleeve, but the largest hurdle of Dreamsleeve use would of been overcome with the soul ferrying the communique passed whatever barriers the Dreamsleeve possesses. This scenario certainly raises ethical issues of Dreamsleeve communication, but there are surely situations where the cost of a life is worth the ability to send information that is guaranteed to be unimpeded. Additionally this introduces the inherent danger of combining necromantic magicks with one of the main life sustaining phenomena in Mundus.  Whatever their methodology may be let us all hope those who are using the Dreamsleeve for correspondence are doing so inhabitually and with great caution.

However, this seems to run contrary to established lore in that the stars, from which the constellations are formed, are the exit wounds left by the Magne-Ge in their flight from Mundus. Thus it seems to me that as ""stars"" are scars in creation rather than entities present in the Mundus (such as the planets and moons), they should not have an active effect in the lives of Nirn's inhabitants. So to me, this begs questions, and not just limited to the constellations themselves.

* Why do the patterns of exit wounds play a role in personalities and traits?

* What determine's a specific constellation's ""selection?"" For one to be born under a certain sign, what determines that the sign is ""active?"" Is it basically a parallel to our astrology?

* Given that Mundus is Nirncentric rather than Magnecentric, by what means do the heavens move? We observe Magnus revolving around Nirn at a much faster rate than the rest of the heavens, so why is his hole not connected to the holes from the flight of his followers?

This last question led me to what I currently believe to be the case, although I'm certain you'll have something to say against it.

[Begin Conjecture] (/g) We've discussed the sky; the nightblack are all the overlapping realms of Oblivion, the planets are the corspes of the Aedra, and the light sources holes to Aetherius. I've seen it said that the actual bodies of the Aedra are at once infinite and zero, that they are shapeless and unknowable and the filter of the mortal mind makes them appear to us as spherical bodies, for the sphere is the quintessential Anuic shape. Given that the planets follow the Mundane equivalent of solar mechanics, I believe that there ARE in fact rocks in the space beyond the atmosphere of Nirn, and that they are simply tied metaphysically to their Aedra. Can we not say the same for the sun and stars? Can the sun not be a light originally installed by Magnus (whether or not it's a flaming ball of fusion is really irrelevant here, IMHO) and that it was linked to him in his flight? His portal is at once everywhere and nowhere and incomprehensible to our finite minds, but it is linked so strongly to the sun that it is both at once? Thus I hold that there IS a light circling Mundus, and there ARE physical stars on the edge of the Mundane sphere, and the sun and planets and the star-rim move independently (as seen in-game).

So building off my premise that the stars do physically exist, and serve as representations of the Flight as well, we return to my original question about the constellations. I don't have a ready answer for this. I can at most say that either Magnus as Architect or Lorkhan as trickster/changer/fan of variety or some entity designed the star-rim to display shapes, and hold ideas, traits, and tendencies within them. The constellations thus serve to add variety to the lives of Nirn's inhabitants by linking them to those born under them, slightly pushing their attached mortals along thirteen different paths. [End Conjecture] (/g)

Or maybe it's superstition and astrology, like how (meta) our horoscopes can occasionally work but are correlative rather than causative. But that seems boring, and therefore wrong. Of course, my answer isn't interesting and therefore right. Rip me apart.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,Moth,True,t3_11yb33,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/11yb33/constellations_and_effects/,

Their Nerevarine prophecies promised someone who would strike down the false gods of the Tribunal and drive all of the outlanders from Morrowind. The Nerevarine they ended up getting WAS an outlander, likely not even a Dunmer, and actually banded with the Tribunal (well, Vivec, anyway) to strike Dagoth Ur down.

I always thought, ""Wouldn't the Ashlanders be at least partially upset about this?""

But the more I thought about it, I realized that this was a bit of brilliant storytelling from Bethesda. All of the Tribunal gods, in essence, fall during the course of the game, as a result of the appearance of the Nerevarine. Think about it: Vivec comes to terms with the loss of his divinity once the Heart of Lorkhan is destroyed, accepting that he will eventually and finally die. Almalexia loses her mind at the idea that her godliness with fade, murders Sotha Sil in her madness, and is herself killed by the Nerevarine.

This might just be blindingly obvious and I'm only just now realizing it, but I think it's a really interesting twist to the prophecy; that the Nerevarine does strike down the Tribunal gods, if indirectly.

If they don't have that reasoning, are they just glorified Draugr with masks and staves, or are they directly controlled by dragons? That is to say, if Draugr wake up on their own to worship at night, would the Dragon Priests wake up on their own and get orders and directives from the dragons nearby?

Lastly, what was the Dragon Cult's relationship with the Dovahkiin, if there was one? On the one hand, I could see them loathing anyone who was Dragonborn just because of the fact that they are the ultimate dragonkillers, but on the other, I could see room for a Dovahkiin performing a ceremonial role for the Cult by absorbing the knowledge of a dragon that was mortally wounded (putting aside the bit about dragons never really dying until their souls are stolen) and dispersing it throughout the ranks.",,False,,t5_2t5ay,False,,,True,t3_yc0zq,http://www.reddit.com/r/teslore/comments/yc0zq/ive_got_a_couple_questions_about_dragon_priests/,

Even non-mages sell them occasionally.  Court wizards just seem to have them hanging around, in sight of anybody.
