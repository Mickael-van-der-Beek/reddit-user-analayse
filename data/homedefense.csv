1368298972.0,71,self.homedefense,1e547b,My dad is a forensic crime expert and had this to say on night invasions in homes.,minos16,91,20,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/1e547b/my_dad_is_a_forensic_crime_expert_and_had_this_to/,"I used to do a lot of Urban Exploration which naturally involved a lot of B&amp;E. I can confirm the cat burglar IAMAs which suggest unlocked/breakable backdoor, windows, side entrances being the easiest way in(never had to break anything, perhaps reach a second floor window). 

What always confused was night break ins on home. Buildings at night are easy(live cams suck at night, darkness can hide you from guards),  but homes? 90% chance somebody is sleeping there and too dark to see. Daylight hours are much easier.... 

So I asked my dad...he said something about thieves being stupid...then said ""Oh! I remember!""

Apparently, these thieves usually target people they know; knowing the best way in/time AND whose house is holding valuable. Night is no problem because they know you have a safe behind the washing machine in the basement. You invited him over to watch the Final four last week and he cased the joint.

More importantly, they target drug dealer houses, criminals, etc. because they know there is a big stash in there.
 
My own experience; some thieves specifically targeted foreigners for this reason(stash, less likely to go to cops) and many dealers/criminals have irregular schedules that make day invasions perhaps even more risky than night.

Any public knowledge that your home holds lots of guns, jewels, cash/gold under mattress, safes, etc. and especially drugs is like a sign that says ""Come at me Bro"" to professional thieves. Unlike the usual stolen junk(electronics, cheap watches, trinkets) you will get fair market value for these already pricey goods.

Coincidentally, my friend helped a stranger get a amazing job(decent pay/hours) and let him sleep over good Samaritan style regularly. He also had a ""stash"" he bragged about and...yep...got robbed by the stranger.

TL;DR: So before you buy another shotgun for defense, stop bragging about your stash or 10+ gun rack. Thieves are attracted to treasure hordes so the less people know about what your protecting; the better! Many thieves rob those they know(night and day) because of prior intel so watch who you ""befriend"" or brag to.

I knew we needed an alarm ASAP but I didn't want to waste money on some simple door and window switches from Lowe's, and was certainly not going to shell out $40/mo for some operator to call the cops for me. Plus, I haven't had a landline in years...

After spending an honest 3 hours of googling for some sort of affordable smart-home system I could control with my iPhone, I almost gave up. They're understandably expensive and more geared toward automation than security. Luckily, I stumbled upon this [magical little device](http://obihai.com/), then remembered a well-reviewed [DIY system](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP93BW/ref=oh_o00_s00_i02_details) I had seen on Amazon and immediately realized they might work together, utilizing Google Voice.  

The Skylink system looked perfect and had solid enough reviews on Amazon for me to take the risk of connecting 3 separate pieces of technology... which usually ends up being a nightmare. However, I called Skylink support before placing my order to see - if by some chance - they had heard of the Obi100 and if they knew it would be compatible with the ""Dial Alert"" unit. They had, it is. Order was placed. 

Two days later, I get the items in from Amazon and get to work. Here's a [pic](http://i.imgur.com/QqsNg.jpg) of what's included. The Obi100 vs Obi110 saves you $10 and works just fine unless you *have* a landline you're wanting to port through the unit. A nice little instructional video can be found on their website, but the included manual was clear enough for me. I bought a $6 phone from Wal-Mart and had a dial tone from Google Voice about 10 minutes later. Really easy to set up. (Google Voice is totally free, but is not capable of calling 911. Similar restrictions apply to other VOIP services and units like Magic Jack, but they are not free like GV. If you are already using Skype or other VOIP, however, you can skip the Obi100 and hook the Dial Alert right up to your current line. Skylink reiterated that ""all you need is a dialtone for the unit to work"" but I cannot attest to the accuracy of this statement, especially considering long-distance calls. GV will make US long-distance calls without issue, but I'm not sure about international.) 

The Skylink was a snap to set up as well. I started with the Dial Alert unit, which is kept in my office near my router and the Obi100. Within a few minutes I had programmed in a recorded emergency message to dial my cell number, then my wife's number, and a few contacts. You can program up to 9 numbers, in order of importance, with each having the ability to cancel the alarm and stop the call from being kicked down to the next in line. (Skylink recommends not programming in emergency numbers, but it's easy enough for someone to hang up and dial 911, etc. after hearing your personal emergency message.) 

Once the Dial Alert was working, I mounted the magnetic alarms on our front and back doors, and toyed with the motion detector, but have not set it up yet. The control unit sits by our front door and was surprisingly easy to program - with a slew of options for home mode, night mode, 4 different zones with unique traits, etc. We have the front door set to a 30 second delay while armed, allowing us easy entry and time to disarm the unit, but the back door will immediately sound the alarm and trigger the Dial Alert if the sensor is tripped. The system comes with a great selection to get you going (it even has a keychain remote) but you can add something like 30 peripherals at your leisure! 

I am very happy with the bang-for-buck combination and love knowing I will be alerted if my home is breached again - at no cost from here on out. No, I do not work for Skylink or Obi100 haha. I kept this review short and sweet but would be happy to answer any more specific questions about either of the units. I hope this might help some of you on a budget like myself!

My I.T. job assigned me some security camera install jobs and give me some really tight requirements on a tight budget(under $7k). They gave me time to experiment with quite a few brands, software from the higher end side(Arecont, Avigilon, Axis, ACTi) and some low end garbage.

I had a few weeks to basically mess around with IP cameras and have a background in pro photography/video: Hopefully it helps some of you guys;

1. Hybrid IP/DVR versus IP/NVR; Unless you have some legacy cams lying around, go with all IP with a NVR. DVR cards aren't cheap and the IP cams is where the industry is going. I'm not turning this into a quality debate but IP&gt; Traditional DVR setups.

2. Low end crap versus higher end stuff:

Keep in mind that most CCTV cameras are garbage compared to professional cam equipment right down to lenses. Your setup isn't going to put out HD TV show quality vids without dropping **massive** sums.

Many IP cams are unfortunately....Fully automatic with limited tweaking options. Some allow you to change the lens and adjust aperture, focus, etc. on the lens or in software....expensive ones.

Basically, don't design your security cam system around quality footage in lieu of decent coverage. For a home price range, you won't get much quality unless your budget starts in the thousands so don't expect perfect face grabs for identification unless they directly in front of it(and close).

Many demo vids take place in VERY well lighted rooms or outside(day time): in regular room light even professional cameras struggle let alone the tiny sensors in those cheap $200 amazon sets. 

3. Lighting, outside, and IR/LEDs:

Since most CCTV cams aren't.....good...at all; maximize their effectiveness via light, IR/LED, and placement.

When a cam has ample light, the automatic settings can use less ISO(noise) and higher aperture ranges(sharper image, less shallow DOF).  Many cam software won't tell you this... and some consumer models for ""indoor"" usage don't even have IR/LEDs. 

Unless the room has alot of windows or tons of light; YOU need IR/LEDs. Cam quality takes a gigantic dive indoors without them on my units with $600-800+ price tags. You can manually make LED/IRs to add to those cameras powered by a battery(instructables!).

Yes, those LED/IR help alot during indoor/daytime....trust me.


4. NVR server:

If your using those all-in-one setups then this is taken care of; otherwise.... 

Build your own. Unless your utterly incompetent with computers. It's just a PC running the camera software and recording. Some software allows you to record direct to a NAS bypassing the need for a stand alone NVR: could cut costs there.

5. Ultra-wide angle(3mm) lenses/cams are good for corners &amp; up-close; not much for anything else.

6. Software....all-in-ones probably come with software. Some software brands allow you to push processing to the camera or allow local storage recording(Axis). Others allow alot of alarm configuration and other settings. Some cam have free software and then a higher tier software with more options($$).

Some can notify you of motion via phone or email so you can log into live view when stuff hits the fan.

One gigantic benefit of custom camera software is mixing multiple brands.I don't need a $300-$800 camera for every room. Maybe just for the door and the rest are cheapo crap cams for evidence purposes. 

For example, I use alnet cam software which allows me to schedule, choose the sound files, and basically create my own motion alarm system to my exact specification. Freebie software might be lacking in similar options or dumb them down a lot.

7. Resolution;

Resolution DOES not determine image quality. It allows you to blow up a small portion of a image and maintain clarity/detail. Good for picking out tiny details like license plates across a parking lot.

A bad/cheap HD camera might be 2-8MP but the image quality is so bad that it looks like SD. However I'd avoid anything under 1 MP unless it's in a non-essential area. 1-3MP+ is the sweet spot for critical areas(doors) and big areas. For covering a whole parking lot/farm field with few cams....5MP to 10MP+ is good. Shell out the bucks though($1000 for each unit). 

8. Zoom:

Optical: actual lens can zoom in. Useful for some people...nice feature.

Digital zoom: Fake zoom....no different from using the magnifying button in photoshop or windows. It's not a ""real"" feature but marketers act like it is. 

PTZ: these cameras can pan/tilt/zoom.....useful if the cam software allows the cam to follow a target or if you like live view spying alot. Otherwise, save your money....most cams will be fine static. If it's following one target, it might miss the other for example.

A useful example is a PTZ cam that will zoom out normally but zoom in on any transaction at the cash register allowing you to pinpoint shady money counting much easier....optical zoom that is.

9. Placement:

IF a ton of light is behind the subject, then the subject will be blacked out unless your cam has some really wide dynamic range($$$$). 

Try to get a up-face shot instead of trying to tag a face from 20 feet away.

10. Wireless cameras.

Wireless cameras are like wireless speakers: Retarded beyond belief in most situations.

Many IP camera get their power via Ethernet(POE). If the data is sent wirelessly.....it still needs a power source. 

So take your pick: 1 cable for power/wireless data transmission(with bandwidth issues) or 1 data/power cable. Without a portable power pack(low capacity or $$) you need a cable either way.

If you don't want to run Ethernet cable through out a house but have plenty of outlets; wireless can make sense. Otherwise go with POE. 

11. Cheap all-in-one camera systems($200-$600):

I haven't tried a all-in-one, but I'm going to automatically assume the quality is acceptable at best...god awful at worst. Avoid the Non HD ones unless it's for watching kids or a nanny.

I think you'd have better luck taking advantage of Deterant methods such as software motion sensor alarms, signs, or additional fake cameras. They're good enough for evidence gathering on some thief/nanny when he's caught but your not likely to pull his license plate from across the road or get a good Face ID. 

Some older/cheap setups might not even notify you of motion detected at odd hours. Nicer setups can allow you to actually speak to the offender live from your phone or computer: ""Get the hell out of my house tweaker!!""

If I had a large property and needed to watch for poachers, dumb kids, animals, service employees, many rooms, etc.....dump the samsung/foscam and buy some Platinum CCTV cams(good value) with a NVR.

Upgrade ability: Many of those all-in-one systems lack the ability to add tons of cameras or even process the video of additional streams. Likely can't add non-matching brand cameras.

In contrast to all-in-one systems:

More expensive to go with the stand alone BUT if you have the parts for an NVR lying around(POE switch, unused PC or a NAS) you can probaly buy a just buy the software and cams for the same price but get better quality.

Feel free to pinpoint ANY mistakes.

Three days ago my car was broken into by a bunch of kids from the neighborhood. This isn't the first time things have been taken (Lawn chairs, hoses, lawn mower) and I'm sure it won't be the last.    
    
    
Well, things came to a head the other night when I noticed that the crawl space door to the attic in my garage was open. Thinking it was incredibly odd I took a look up there. Inside I found the usual boxes I had put up there, and also some empty chip bags.     
    
Well, I didn't think anything of it and shut the door (its a piece of wood that just slides over it). 

This morning when I go up, I went out the garage door to grab something from my car, and noticed the attic door open again.     
     
At this point I am convinced someone is sleeping in my garage attic and then just leaving before I get up. I work late nights from home as a web developer, and so I frequently go to bed after 3am, and don't get up until 11am.     
    
At this point, I need some kind of home surveillance system. As I am a retired U.S. Army vet, I am find with my M4 and Para .45 for inside my house. However, I need something to monitor the outside and record what goes on.     
     
I am very new to all of this and would appreciate some advice as to what I should do now.     
     
My needs I believe are:
 
* Outdoor Camera's (I live in Central Illinois, so they need to stand some cold)
* A unit to record
* Ability to view the live feed at home and via cell.

If you guys could point me in the direction of systems I could install myself that would be great, otherwise, if anyone knows of any services I should look into that would also help.

My budget for this is around $500-$800. Thank You.

So here's the situation:

I recently bought a little plot of land, not too far from my home, just to go and relax and have some barbecues with friends in the summer and what not. It's really ideal for that ([PIC](http://imgur.com/u4blxcW)), just outside the city so it's quiet and we don't disturb anyone.

Now the problem is that there are other people using it like they own it and even vandalizing it. So far I have encountered the following things: the shed in the back is vandalized a little more each time I come, I have found a cage to catch magpies (with a live one in it as bait), feeding barrel for pheasants and most annoyingly trash ([PIC](http://imgur.com/NPkyAyq)).

At first I tried being nice, I just put up signs saying ""This is private property, you are not allowed to enter without permission from the owner"" and even added an e-mail address to contact me on.
Of course these signs just kept disappearing and nothing changed.

I considered my options and since this place has no electricity I figured the best I could do was just padlock the gate. Got myself a reasonably decent lock ([LINK](http://www.masterlock.eu/products/detail/Padlocks-Weathertough/ExcellPadlocks)) because I knew they were going to try and mess with it. This worked for a month or two. For a while there was no trespassing.

Skip ahead to a couple of weeks ago. I arrive to open my gate and notice somebody has tried to drill the lock open. But since they were barely able to chip the lock and it still worked I just chuckled. I was glad I bought a decent lock and thought that was the end of it.

Then there is today. I arrive and try to open my lock but my key won't go in. Turns out these bastards glued the lock shut!

So now I'm wondering what to do next.
I'm sure as hell not going to go without a lock again, but I also don't want to be buying new locks all the time.

Do you guys have any ideas?
Are there maybe padlocks that can't be sabotaged this way?
Other suggestions?

**UPDATE #1**

I tried the acetone on the lock, like /u/mportz suggested, and it worked perfectly. Thanks!

Today my neighbor informed me that some guy was taking pictures of my house. When the neighbor went to confront the guy, he ran into his SUV and sped off. Luckily my neighbor was able to get the guy's license plate. 

It turns out that the previous owner ( I recently moved ) had somebody using the house as a craigslist scam, listing the house for rent to get security deposits. Some of the scammed people had showed up to the house. I do have some contractors doing some work on the house and am waiting to hear back from them before I file a police report. 

If I file a report I will keep copies on hand in case somebody does show up that was scammed. Also I am contacting the previous home owner to see if he may have any further information. 

Now I am assuming that this fellow was the scammer, however it could be unrelated. Still concerning as he ran away. Although my neighbor is a marine that open carries all the time, which may have something to do with it.

Not sure what else to do, other than general security.

Update:

Yesterday ( one day after the first event) another neighbor they saw the same guy/car in the morning. Said he took pictures and some notes and drove off. 

Actions taken so far; I filed a police report and installed a visable camera. Veified the guy wasn't related to a contractor or my bank. Also checked CL but haven't seen anything yet. This weekend I will pull some weeds/clean up the lawn so the house appears more occupied than it already does. 

Also of note; somebody could take pretty good pictures of the house without even getting out of a car and wouldn't need all that many for CL. Old pictures are also available on one of the many reality websites.

Deliberate about it. Debate it. But please think about it and consider what you would do. I’m interested in what you have to say.

I was sitting in my favorite recliner clicking away on [reddit!](http://reddit.com) waiting for the wife to get home from late shift. At 12:30am the door, which is ten feet away from me (and which I left unlocked for her), suddenly and quietly opened and a young man steped inside. Even though the room was brightly lit, it took a second for my eyes to focus and realize that it was not my wife. He looked a little surprised that I was there and said, “Uh… hi.” 

Now, I was *extremely* vulnerable right then and there and I knew it. But I wasn’t about to expose my disadvantage. My children were asleep right down the hall and all that mattered to me was taking a position between them and this intruder. The only thing within reach for defense was half of Mt. Dew, my laptop and a flip flop. I knew I had to pull off a bluff in a big way. I began shouting, “GET OUT! GET OUT!” as I bolted toward him (and by bolted I mean I had to do the fat man sit up and roll off the recliner first).  By this point, my two big dogs and the little mutt were aware that something was wrong and offered a chorus of convincingly vicious barks with some nasty snarls thrown in for good measure. My intruder took heed and fled closing the door behind him.

I did not chase. I armed myself, stayed with my kids and called 9-1-1. When police arrived, they made every effort to find the intruder but there wasn’t enough information to go on. The entire contact in my home lasted only 4-5 seconds. 

A few facts I’ve since pondered:

•	I’ll never truly know what the intent of this intruder was; Assume the worst and you will survive longer.

•	Ultimately, I really don’t care why he was there. I wanted to but I didn’t ask questions. The answers didn’t matter then. An uninvited guest has to go, not answer questions. Someone that wants to use your phone will knock. You choose whether you want to open the door or not. The choice should not be made for you.

•	I was not prepared for this event. I have considered many ways to react to a threat. Not this one, at this time, in this way. Have a plan. Practice your plan. Have your family practice your plan

•	Command presence - If you don’t got it… get it! Bluff if you have to.

•	Dogs rule! They probably saved me and my kids from something bad. They are the reason this guy left. Not me.

By the grace of God no harm came to anyone. I don’t have any regrets about my reaction but it has forced me to consider some changes at my house to maintain an advantage (lighting, locks, plans and practice). I am blessed and thankful. Take care all.

A night thief who sees the red IR lights of a camera is likely to just skip on the next house IMO. A nearly invisible camera isn't as an effective deterrent. EDIT: Soco pointed out some units have nearly invisible IR lights whereas others have easily visible IR lights on the cam. Sometimes they may purposely have a visible ""sensor"" or ""On"" light with invisible IR.
 
The camera doesn't have to be bold, just visible(SOME IR lights are easy to see at night, invisible during day time so your house won't look like HAL 2000 runs it). 

Don't get a dome for outside(in the back) unless you want to be discrete....get something that will make a thief think ""I'm already on camera....screw it, I'll hit the joint across the street"". For the front door it makes sense for discrete though.

----------

Analog Versus IP:

Go IP unless you have a legacy system....you might want to get an analog card for the server to use/interface non-IP cameras or Non-IP security devices(like a separate alarm buzzer or door system) if needed.

-----------

Power over Ethernet: this is your friend!! Even better....if your home is networked, a POE switch can power a device from another room over existing, normal Ethernet lines.
-----------

Blue Iris: Good software and dirt cheap: Can't say I had any major issues although one cam would crash blue iris whenever the settings on that one camer changed. It can handle 15+ cams like a champ and now has Direct to disk recording. No client software option if you want to control blue iris on the same network from multiple locations(perhaps I'm wrong?). You can via the phone software or use the web interface on other PCs(which has limited controls.
Somebody please correct the above if wrong....I'm not a expert on Blue IRis!

-----------

If your intimidated by the thoughts of building a NAS, NVR/DVR server PC, etc. and your applications aren't critical: 

Many newer cams can actually do the server related functions onboard and just record data to any PC/NAS on the network(if it's on). So you could throw up 4 cameras and invidually set up each for motion tracking, schedules, PTZ patrols, recording, SMS/email notification, etc. as long as they're getting internet and power(and a place to dump the recordings).

You do sacrifice some abilities to accomplish this but if it's not critical then you could roll out a few cams fairly quick. Axis cams allows direct recording to a SDcard so you could bypass the PC/NAS entirely and review records solely through the web interface or software from any PC. Axis cams are pretty pricey though. Some cheaper brands have the ability though with SD card recording.

If I owned a little store, I wouldn't mind using a non-server solution with SD cards to save some cash on building a server plus electricity costs. 

---------------

Foscams and their clones: Foscams suck....sorry....had to be said. For the price($60-ish) they aren't a bad deal: they do work although some functions work poorly. Spend the extra cash on something better. They do have the ability listed above for web server functions which is nice.

-------------

When it comes to phone streaming and configuration; some brands are easier than others to get working with third party streaming software like tinycam pro. Some proprietary phone/computer brand camera software won't add competitor cameras.

------

*** Have a issue with your camera getting the IP or firmware installs? Do a HARD reset on the physical unit. Factory default via software is not a substitute for this! I've had at least 4-5 units including a fresh RMA that needed a physical reset not software.  ***!!!

-----
Many cameras require a login to connect to a third party software like blue iris or the default web interface:

Default Usernames for many cameras:

root

admin

(none)

Default passwords for most cameras I tried are:

admin

password

12345

123456

(none)

If the camera is used, it might have a different password....hard reset time!!! 
-------

SMS notification, emails don't do jack squat if you never check them/see them. Consider an alarm of some sort either on camera or somewhere else so you don't miss a thief because your phone battery died at work. Cheaper cams typically lack audio gear or decent audio processing/speakers at that. Spend more to get one with playback so you can attach speakers. Onboard speakers suck so get something external. Some nicer cams have a power out to power addition speakers, microphones, and IR Lamps.

Microphones can also be set as triggers for alarms or SMS/email notification.

You can schedule alarms and change them either in camera or through your standalone server software. Scheduling is obviously a must. 
------------

Get a camera with IR lights or a separate IR lamp to make up for it...only expensive units seem to have decent ISO performance at night. Some units are practically pitch black.
----------


ADT from my observation seems to ring your house if something is detected before calling the police. You can get your camera server to ring you via the telephone depending on your detection parameters. I suppose it's possible to get your independent camera running an on-board webserver to do this as well. 

----------

Don't go nuts on 5MP+ cameras....many have bad FPS(frames per second) unless you spend quite a bit.

---------

10-15 FPS is fine for most of your needs. 5-7 FPS is pushing it. 2-3 is bad!! 20-30+ if you have tons of recording space. 

--------

If a camera is under $80 new, I'd avoid it....

---------
**brands**

Dahua: is probably the best bang for your buck brand around(they are usually rebadged under other brands for more $$). Kinda hard to find in the USA....support might be lacking since they're primarily an OEM manufacturer without a significant USA presence. YMMV on support since I never experienced it myself. I liked the quality of these a lot so far.

Platinum CCTV: costs a little more than the higher end Dahua but has excellent support and the owner inspects each individual unit before shipping although they don't offer the same variety of IP cameras as Dahua. If you need help setting these up with blue Iris, chose the Hisilicon option for the camera model.

Axis: has excellent support and good quality. Price is higher but it's reliable and has a lot of excellent features like the SD card recording.DONT drop the M-series...I've had two units break doing this....RMA took only 2 days!! I like the default free software....easy to configure the above mentioned web server and software for SD recordings.

Arecont is decent but scraps features in favor of size and higher MP in it's units: however areconts can be had cheaply used sometime. I wouldn't get a Arecont for home use but would for a daytime(or night with large IR lamp) wide area like say... a farm or parking lot since the 5-10MP can be useful there. Consider them specialty cameras....

Mobotix: never tried; heard good things.

Avtech: meh.....haven't tried much...website is a mess. I have an older crappy unit lying around so I'm a bit biased.

Rebadged Chinese: Quite a few brands are just rebadge of OEM cameras with small modifications made by the company or additional Quality testing and support. Qsee is usually rebadged Dahuas and the Costco brand used them as well at one point!

Avigilon: good but on the pricey side....rather wide selection but like Arecont, it's overkill for the home IMO for the price your spending....software licenses ain't cheap for software. If its a pro-level installation, they will come out to you with advisors!

Acti: Good price, good quality; I like these but configuring them for third party software was a PITA sometimes(especially live RTSP 2 way). No android phone app and needed a firmware update on to get the best quality image on my units so do a hard reset and then get the latest firmware. My units are at least 4 years old however so newer ones might be a bit easier. Choose Acti 6002 as your camera on Blue Iris. 

Sony/Toshiba/Panasonic/Samsung, etc.: I've never tried these brands but read reviews if your thinking of buying. I've heard good things about Panasonics.

Foscams and the clones: Unless budget is the most important factor, avoid anything that looks like a foscam since it's the same hardware or a knock off banking on the popularity. Compatibility is high and they do have a lot of features crammed into it for the price. Speakers suck, audio is iffy but the mic out allows a higher quality attachment. It's not the worst IP cam by far I have but it's near the bottom(avtech takes that prize)....plus the cheapest, older ones AREN'T POE powered.


For $50-60 I'd buy a used IP camera of a better brand off ebay if cost is a factor per unit.

They tried to break-in 3 times, 3 times they failed because of the safety glass which wouldt break.

Now i have added some more security layers.   

* Alarm system

    I bought a wired end of life set for a very good price.

    In the set was included: 8 motion sensors, 1 panic button , 3 door magnet sensors, 2 keypads, 1 indoor sirene and 1 outdoor sirene
  
    [One of the keypads](http://i.imgur.com/R9XRA.jpg)

    [One of the motion sensors](http://i.imgur.com/w9nmO)

    [An extra sirene horn](http://i.imgur.com/JCLwl.jpg)

    I found 2 of these sirene horns at a second-hand market at 12 euro's for both, i still have to figure out how i am going to install these


* Ip camera system
  
    To gain experience ""on the field"" i was assigned to a tutor electrician where i had to work for 8 weeks.

    Since most shops were replacing older IP camera's to mobotix ip camera's i could keep 2 replaced pieces

    [Acti ACM 3310 on a self made bracket](http://i.imgur.com/hYn38.jpg)

    [Vivotek IP7361](http://i.imgur.com/tIo3k.jpg) (in the back ground you can see the outdoor sirene and in front the PIR detector for floodlights)


    [The same Vivotek](http://i.imgur.com/HL1eX.jpg)
     
    I still have to do some cable managment to do for both and there are still 3 IP cameras incoming and again a 2 Vivotek IP7361 and a [Vivotek MD7560](http://i.imgur.com/q1M1z.jpg)

* Floodlights and IR illuminators
     
    IR illuminators are very important since the standard embedded camera IR illumination is not enough making them useless at night.

    [IR illuminator](http://i.imgur.com/WXueq.jpg)
     
    I still have to mount these and unfortunately i dont know the brand of it

    Floodlights scare burglars when they light up, my floodlight will only light up on PIR motion detection and will keep on for 12 minutes.
    I did this because keeping them on all night long will consume a lot of energy thus increasing your power bill

    [One already mounted](http://i.imgur.com/flq4a.jpg)

    [3 more](http://i.imgur.com/jSVao.jpg)

* Security perimeter
     
     Chainlinks fences have the advantage that they are easily placed and are quite cheap, the disavantage is that they are also easily breached by cutting trough the chainlinks, if you have the money go for a hard bar fence.

     We already had a chainlink fence with 1 line of barded wire on top and 2 at the bottom, the fence is 2.35 meters high, the total fence is 300 meters long, it completely surrounds our yard.
      
     [Chainlink fence](http://i.imgur.com/7sXdg.jpg)

     I placed motion sensors just behind the fence (note: these in the pictures are temporary, the permanent will be mounted on a wooden pole)
      
     [Perimeter motion sensor](http://i.imgur.com/f05qq.jpg)

     [one of the wooden pole's ](http://i.imgur.com/7liZd.jpg)
 
     i am thinking of mounting a floodlight and/or a camera too on the pole.

     To see where motion is detected i am going to make a panel where a led will light up where the motion is detected.

    [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/8L9tt.jpg)
   (This is a control panel for model trains, i made this a few years ago)

* Software

      The software i use to record and manage my Ip camera's is Milestone, its a really decent software pakket, i got my license for free and can install up to 24 camera's so i dont know the price for it.

       Our garage doors and automatic front gate are managed with paxton, again i got this license for free and dont know the price of this

I think i mentioned all important thing i am going to do, if you have questions ask ahead.
The total price for all the devices and equipment was around 800-900 euro

(and sorry for my bad english im not a good english speaker/writer)



EDIT: added a map (made in paint) to give an idea how it all looks like.

Someone tried picking my lock while I was away on Tgiving break. They were unsuccessful but this is a wake up call. 

I am on a college student's budget, but nonetheless I need to secure my home for my safety and peace of mind.

Here are my ideas, please supplement them with your own advice.

-Looking at a Sentry B series (one of the larger ones) and a door jamb reinforcement with 3 inch screws. 

-We already have a charley bar and a piece of wood in the track of the sliding glass door. Shatter-proof film is pricey though, any recommendations?

-We added bars to the tracks of our windows which slide open sideways (sliding side inside) and duct taped the inside to prevent lifting. 

-I'm interested in a camera. Peephole cameras are really appealing, but the only ones in my price range connect to a DVR, I'd prefer using something like Vitamin D software with wireless cameras (again, I'll take your advice). 

-Ideally I'd like a peephole camera and a camera facing out from the other entrance, but I might just have a camera hidden inside. What's the best (and most economical) way to set up a camera system? It seems that the cameras I can afford are not outdoor ones. 

SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR!
-(Creepy) neighbor always parks right outside of my bedroom window, even though its out of the way of his apartment. He gave me a weird look when I saw him walk to his car (and realized it's his), but then again he's always weird even though I try to be friendly and say hi when I see him around (just civilly). 

-My roommate and I may have seen someone casing our place, we both told each other about seeing the same car with someone sitting in it while someone else walked around. I think we saw the same thing on two different days, days after the break-in attempt.

1358981157.0,20,self.homedefense,175gzb,How do I catch a brazen daytime burglar from trying to get in my backyard? [xpost from r/DIY],homealoneingit,25,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/175gzb/how_do_i_catch_a_brazen_daytime_burglar_from/,"Hi HomeDefense

I was recommended to you guys over on [my original post in r/DIY](http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/174r9h/how_do_i_catch_a_brazen_daytime_burglar_from/) and had some questions I hope you might be able to help me with. 

In the original post, I detailed how someone has been trying to break into my backyard for the past few days now. I don't live in a fantastic neighborhood and my neighbors have had some issues with burglarly in the last 2-4 months so I'd like to bolster my deterrence around the house. Here's what I've come up with at the very least so far: 

* brinks signs/stickers to put around the property
* ""smile, you're on camera"" sign
* dummy camera with light

I've been combing through a lot of the really useful posts here and am a little overwhelmed with my options. I have narrowed down what I think I'm looking for but could use some reassurance and help to make sure I'm not missing something or going out of my league (technically speaking). Also, a lot of the options I was looking at were PC only solutions and I am on a Mac. 

I really want to install an outdoor camera and have been looking through many of the options presented in this subreddit like dropcam (which I like but doesn't seem to be meant for outdoor nor do I want to pay any type of subscription fee) and airvision/cam. I've looked at software like [mobotix](http://www.mobotix.com/eng_US/content/view/full/32803) as well which appears to be free. 

I like the aircam but I'd prefer an outdoor, day/night security camera that plugs into an outlet for power rather than via ethernet (it's not going to be possible for me to power my security camera that way). I like the airvision software but it looks a little overkill for me. I'm really just looking for a software that can record feeds (triggered by motion) to my mac and notify me on my iphone that the video recording has been triggered or - even better - allow me to view the video recording from my iphone. I'd prefer free software (obviously) but am willing to purchase software for my mac/iphone if it can do all of those things.  I've looked at the DVR methods and there just seem to be too many wires and a setup that is too complicated for me to manage.

I also started looking at the indoor Foscam you guys recommend and would probably like to find software that allows me to put both the outdoor and the indoor camera on the same monitoring software (and by extension, notification cycle) once I can afford purchasing an indoor camera as well which will be later on. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

I haven't shopped this stuff in a long time, so I am curious what to even ask for in this space.

1) One of the exterior doors is actually the inside door between the garage and the house... can I get (or is it smart) to alarm the overhead door? 

2) With children, I am adverse to using motion sensors, since they could be running down / through the house at night to get a drink when the alarm is armed... 

3) Cellular backup - is this worth the extra cost? What is the typical additional monthly cost on this?

4) And lastly - What is the best way to buy such that I don't have a large cost upfront. Is it possible there are vendors who roll the system cost in to the monthly fee? Is that smart to do, rather than paying for everything out of pocket?

\\\\\\

I'm redditing in my rented townhome in an older, not so gentrified area of my city... been home for 20 minutes, eating some take out sushi. Tired... hey that's a funny pic.... aaaaaaaaatheism blah blah.

Doorbell rings. What? I don't get unannounced visitors ever. My girlfriend isn't due home for another hour. I remove my .45 from my bag and put it in my waist band. Peephole reveals a late 40's early 50's black man standing on my porch. I open the door...leaving the screen door closed.

I'm going to try and use punctuation or lack of it to illustrate the flow of the convo...

Guy: Hey man my names [forgot it, omitted anyway] and I just moved in across the street...new in town from jersey. I'm not creepy not creepy heh heh [waving his hands in front of him in an attempt to be reassuring] but hey I gotta ask you a question""...

Me: ok...

Guy: You ever lock yourself out your house before man?

He appeared to be somewhat poorly dressed... as in maybe a transient. Unkempt facial hair...

Me: [pause]....no...

I become aware at this moment that I've opened the door completely and he can see into my house....he can see the laptop on my dining room table and into my kitchen where the back door is. I don't notice if he's actually looking into my house. Just that he can...

Guy: Aight aight...say uh... you know where [street and street] is?

Me: yeah that's downtown man... [10 miles away]

Guy: Damn..... Aight thanks man I leave you alone now....

Me: Ok. [close door and lock it]

Look out the window... he's walking further down my street the opposite direction from where he said he lives...

Ok. So. I sit back down at my computer and start thinking about how 
random this seemed and how random he was acting, and how it was odd that he didn't ask me for any help... if he indeed needed it... to be fair, I didn't offer it... I guess I was already a little creeped out.

My thoughts started shifting to the conversation and everything I've laid out above, and I started thinking about the possibility this person was ""casing"" my house, to break in at a later time.

So, A bit about me... I should mention I'm a white male, 31 years old... I live with my girlfriend and we both work during the day. Not a racist person, but admittedly have some basic prejudices like pretty much everyone... Saw that coming, right?

I carry a pistol legally for personal protection. Better to have it and not need it, I say.

My question is, was this interaction shady? From what you've read, am I paranoid? It could go either way I think.

Any thoughts?

TL/DR: Weird interaction at my front door is causing me to worry about my families personal safety... need advice.

**EDIT/UPDATE** 

I've contacted my landlord who manages several properties in the area. After listening to my initial description of this guy and how he'd asked me about being locked out of my place, she interrupted me and asked me if he asked for money. Apparently, residents from their other local properties have also reported a man fitting his description asking similar questions at various times over the last 2 years. He usually asks for money and promises to pay them back when he gets into his apt. She hasn't heard any more about him after those initial reports. 

So if it's the same guy, he's ""infamous"" to the mgmt company. According to her, she's never gotten any violent reports about him, but he apparently is less apt to deal with males that answer the door...as in he's more adamant about asking for money when it's a female. This is hella shady.

I should note that there is a fake security camera in plain sight right by the front door, and I am in the process of having a real one installed.

I'm baffled by why someone would take small houseplants. What is most likely here... Are they seeing what they can get away with, and eventually planning a break in? Is it a way to see if the camera is fake? Should I assume it's just a kid or someone harmless since it's only houseplants?

I am a female living alone, which anyone who has been keeping an eye on my place could easily figure out since no one else regularly enters/exits my house and there is only one car out front. What can I do to protect myself (aside from moving, which isn't an option right now)?

Looking out in front, I had noticed a light in my car on, and upon closer examining, a figure leaning into the window going through it. First to mind comes that I have a firearm in the car in a custom-fabricated compartment underneath the clock pod. The pod opens with a lever by the hood release, and has a solenoid that prevents it from opening with that lever unless accessory power is on (ie. the key is in the ignition and turned). Regardless of those precautions, I proceed to arm myself and quickly brief action to flank and confront the man.     

What ended up happening was that I had called the police and informed them of the situation, as well as my location in a defensive position prepared to confront the man if he began progressing towards my home. A few minutes later, the man was done going through the car with no police response yet. On the entirety of holding my position, I had not observed any kind of activity around the location of the gun, and could clearly see that the pod was still in it's normal position.    


Being a person that keeps nothing (except the aformentioned) of value, the man wasn't holding anything upon leaving, and both to my estimate and discovery, had made off with about 4 dollars and a starbucks gift card. Aware of the fact that I was in a suburban neighborhood, that police were en route looking for a possibly armed suspect, and that I was carrying a black assault weapon, I had decided to hold my position, repeating details of the man's appearance and heading to myself.


The police came, they investigated, and left. No legal implications on myself, and I'm a few cups of coffee poorer.    

But. I can't help but to reflect on my instincts to confront the man in the interests of preventing the theft of a firearm, and prevention of a possibly resulting armed robbery. I understand the implications of leveraging the use of a firearm in such a situation, as well as the suspect being armed being more or less uncertain, but what legal privilege is given to an owner to defend personal property that is parked on a public street? Of course, I would not use lethal force unless, once confronted, the subject had demonstrated both the will and means to harm me, but even then, is the scenario simply not justified on my behalf?

I used to work for one and the company turns their installer's all over the country into heartless sons of guns. My daily life would consist of walking into someone's house who initially thought they were getting their house protected for the $99 they spent when they made the appt (you see an ad and call into ADT and the operators lie and tell you whatever you wanna hear, their goal is to collect the $99 and set up a installation appt), then i go into the house saying the $99 package only comes with the control panel and 2 door/window sensors and 1 motion detector. Customer becomes furious when I would tell them each additional door/window sensor is $129 and Motion detector's are $199, (the same sensors/detectors are selling for 1/5 the price on ebay and amazon). Unless the customer was a prick to begin would setup the cost effective security plan which instead of putting on average 8 window sensors in their living room put 1 motion sensor instead, stuff like that. Manager's would do ""Ride alongs"" to pressure the homeowner into protecting their children with harsh tactics. The routine mode the supervisors used was to quote the house with full protection and when the homeowner became Irate when told it was initially $99 and now their quoted $2500 my supervisor would walk to the children and ask in front of the mother is $2500 worth your child's life? The worst part is most of the customers couldnt afford much and like most of us living paycheck to paycheck, so the supervisors/co workers would drain every dime they could possibly spend with no remorse.

I need a home surveillance system, but I don't know exactly where to start.",Meat_Confetti,20,4,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/1g4fbm/my_house_and_vehicles_are_being_vandalized_i_need/,"Hi Everybody,

So, my house is being terrorized by some local teenage hoodlums.  Our cars have been vandalized, my motorcycle knocked over, etc.  The line was crossed the other night when they threw rocks at my house (breaking a window and storm door window), and climbing onto my rear deck and attempting to gain entry to my house.  So now I'm sufficiently pissed off and ready to spend some money to catch these little pricks.  I even know who's doing it, I just need proof.

That said, I really don't know much about home security systems.  I like the idea of IP cameras, but we currently do not have a desktop computer that we could stream to, only a laptop.  We also don't have a very fast internet connection (DSL at ~3mbps), so uploading to the cloud is out as well.  So I'm thinking of going with wireless cameras, which would record to a DVR inside my house.  My house is pretty small, so the cameras would be within 20' of the DVR.

With that system in mind, I've been shopping around but I'm a little overwhelmed with all the features.  I see that there are bundled DVR/Camera systems out there, but the cameras with these systems don't seem to be very good.  I'm pretty sure that I'll want to buy the DVR and cameras separately.  

So, having said all that, could someone who knows something about this stuff recommend a good outdoor camera(s) and DVR, based on these requirements?

Outdoor Cameras:

* The cameras would need to be IR, with a range of ~60'.  We have decent night lighting around my house and at the public sidewalk.
* What should I consider to be the minimum resolution I need?  I understand that I'm not going to get HD quality here, but need enough to ID a known person at ~50'.  
* Audio would be nice but resolution is more important.
* How are the wireless ones powered?  I imagine there's a transformer between the house 120VAC and the camera, where does that go?

The DVR:

* The DVR would need to record an endless loop, overwriting the oldest footage.  Is that how they all work?  (Sounds like a basic question, but I'm not sure.)  I would only need a few days worth of storage.  If something goes down, I'll know it quickly and save the video elsewhere.

* All I really have is a laptop for viewing the video.  How do you go about getting the video off of the DVR?  (Again, stupid basic question.)  Can I get one with an ethernet port and just plug it into my router?

* Support for 4 cameras should be more than sufficient.  I only really need two, three at the most.

1363835958.0,17,self.homedefense,1aplhl,PSA: Good long-distance driveway alarm,indgosky,19,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/1aplhl/psa_good_longdistance_driveway_alarm/,"I searched the archives here, and was surprised that I didn't find any discussions about driveway alarms, which are especially valuable if you have a long driveway and no nearby neighbors (my situation), or just spend a lot of time with your pants off in the suburbs (you know who you are).

I researched the market quite heavily last year, and have been daydreaming about getting one system in particular for many months, but it was just never in the budget.  

However, we were recently ""inspired"" by a rash of mysterious vehicles driving around the loop in front of our house -- which is a half mile up an obviously-private driveway, off of the public road.  We decided an alarm would allow us to meet them outside next time and ask ""WTF?""  Also, this should help us to not be surprised in the middle of the night by anyone, and to know when an expected visitor or service provider is about to arrive.

Quickly, for anyone new to the market, there are many wireless offerings but almost all of them peter out somewhere between 50 and 200 yards -- great for suburban driveways, or rural houses built close to the road, but not for my situation.

I've only ever found one long range radio alarm option, from a company called ""Dakota Alert"".  The system is based on the fairly-recent ""MURS"" standard, which can reach 2+ miles and carry data as well as voice, without a license.

They offer shorter-range radio products, too, so be sure you're getting the ""MURS"" stuff if that's what you need.

They offer two sensor choices in their MURS line:  

* A standard IR / motion sensing solution, but like everyone's they are prone to false alarms from large animals (especially in rural location).  
* A magnetic probe sensor that you bury, and which only goes off when a large ferrous mass passes by, so no false alarms (but also no alarms for people entering on foot).
* And because the whole thing is MURS based, their alarm base station can double as a long range radio solution if you want to buy a handheld radio or a second base station.

I just received my ""MURS Alert Probe Sensor Kit"" (aka MAPS Kit), which saves a few bucks when you want to buy one magnetic probe and one base station together.  I placed it near the start of my driveway, and tied the base station into our intercom-based doorbell so we can hear the notification from anywhere in the house (in addition to giving a voice alert, the base station also trips a normally-open relay that's provided specifically for the purpose of tripping a doorbell, an alarm, or whatever low-amperage circuit you want tripped) 

The system works flawlessly so far, and I'm a happy camper!

We don't currently have an alarm system or a dog. So my wife would really like a security system for the peace of mind and maybe also a dog (again for peace of mind).

I understand that if you are aware that someone is trying to break into your house, the best course of action is to barricade yourself and loved ones in a bedroom and call the police. Confronting them is not a good idea.

The problem I have - what if I don't have any idea what that *sound* was? A thud, a squeek - or basically some noise **other than a broken window or a door getting kicked in.** We live in a building that's only a few years old - and in a quiet neighborhood. So any out-of-the-ordinary sounds are pretty easy to notice. 

A good example - a few months ago at around 1 a.m. my wife and I were in bed on the third floor. We both woke up to the sound of a loud bang and the sound of something falling down the stairs to the basement. We listened for a few minutes and didn't hear anything else.

Going back to bed wasn't an option - we were afraid someone was inside or something had fallen downstairs. So, I grabbed the only weapon-like thing I have, a 1928 Russian Mosin-Nagant rifle and charged downstairs, adrenaline surging. Turns out, a dry-erase board we had recently installed in the kitchen with 3M strips had fallen off the wall in the staircase and went tumbling down the stairs to the basement. 

Mystery solved, I went back to bed. Things like this happened a few times in the past year - always me going to ""check it out.""

Obviously, the Mosin-Nagant is probably **the worst firearm ever** for home defense. I don't even have it loaded - it's just for intimidation purposes. Plus, the long length and bolt-action of the rifle makes it an incredibly bad choice for defending yourself in a home.

We don't have the money for a pistol (or a security system - we're renting anyway) and we can't care for a dog - and I currently live far from my state of residence so buying another firearm is not ideal.

So right now I""m looking for a better alternative than a 90-year-old war relic **and/or** a better technique for dealing with things that go ""bump"" in the night.

Some of my neighbors (and/or their extended circles) seem to have little respect for property lines...  

On the rare occasion that I (or one of the people who I let use my property) run into these folks in the woods, they lie and say they ""didn't notice any fence"".   My fence is solid, and there's at least one clear path where they've come in.

We've had game cameras stolen, no doubt because the trespasser saw the flash and knew/suspected they'd been photographed.  (And rather than steal the memory card, they take the camera as a bonus)

We've also seen flashlights on the hillside at night, but we'd never get out to them in time to catch them where we saw them (they'd hear us coming anyway).

Which brings me to the request:

My initial thought -- after getting beyond the satisfying daydreams of land mines and heat-seeking rocket launchers -- was to find a model of game camera that they wouldn't notice, and which might be difficult to steal (cable-locked and possibly even alarmed) so I can hand pictures in to the police and/or game wardens.

1321040770.0,12,self.homedefense,m90xc,How to convince my room mate that home security isn't a joke?,WaffleMoose,15,3,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/m90xc/how_to_convince_my_room_mate_that_home_security/,"I'm currently renting a house with 3 other guys I know. One of my room mates had done this twice: Comes back home at dark (once before dawn, once around 10 pm) and starts banging on the door and ringing the bell, instead of using his key to enter. Both times a strange car was in the drive (he doesn't have a car, usually buses or walks) Both times my other roommate (V for clarity) opens the door a crack (no peephole) to see who it is, only to have my idiot roommate force the door in on him. We have tried to explain to him that this is a good way to get punched, stabbed, or shot by anything close at hand, but he just thinks we are being paranoid. However, me and my other roommate don't think forced entry is very funny at all. 

On the first occasion, roommate V answered, but fortunately left his glock on the table or he may very well drawn or even fired on my idiot room mate. On the second occasion, i fetched my remington 870 when i heard banging, bell ringing, and saw a strange car in the drive, but room mate V answered the door first, only to be pushed in on again. I wouldn't open the door without finding out who the hell is banging on it at dark, but room mate V is a little less cautious than me and likes to see who it is. 

Anyway, he responded both times by saying that V and I are too paranoid to even suspect this forced entry to be anything but a joke. How can we explain to him that forced entry, while rare, is a very serious and risky situation that is not to be taken likely? (BTW: i've explained to V why he shouldn't crack the door anymore, so one way or the other this situation is likely not to occur again)

TL;DR: Idiot room mate likes to bang on door then force in when we look to see who it is. Laughs at us when we say that forced entry is a deadly force scenario.

edit 1: The real solution, as said below, is to make sure my other room mate won't open the door to someone banging on it at night. My idiot room mate will learn to use his damn key and not be an idiot. Also, I would love to screw with him while he does this, but we really don't know it's him pounding on the door, so it would be hard to get back at him IRL.

I have never used a trial cam before, so I am a bit uneducated, hopefully someone can help.

-What kind of battery life can I expect? it would need to last for up to 6 months without changing the battery.


-Sensitivity. I dont want 1500 pictures of trees being blown in the wind, but i also dont want to miss the license plate. Would it be a similar sensitivity as a motion detecting 

-Hiding the camera. It wont do me much good if the thiefs just steal the camera.

8. My computer data is backed up to an external site

9. I have a copy of all serial numbers and photos of belongings

1. Someone could kick the door down. I need to buy a gun, but my wife is against having a loaded weapon in the house. I want to eventually get a German Shepherd, but my wife is against large dogs. 

2. I have a safe I dont trust in one cupboard, so the really important papers are in a brief case stashed under a bed. I need a better hiding place or a better safe. 

3. Both gates are largely shielded from view. I have been thinking of hammering a few nails in to discourage anyone trying to climb over them.

I would like to thank you all right now for taking the time to answer my question, to give your advice, and for helping me make a better decision on a firearm.

________________________________________________

Hello,

I am a 22 year old man, still living with my parents, and I currently attend college with my brother. My father, who is in the army, is currently deployed to Afghanistan for the next nine months. Neither my mother, brother, nor I posses the physical strength required to stop a burglar, if one did enter into our home. For my family, besides my father, we are unfortunately stricken with a rare syndrome, which pretty much leaves our bodies frail in comparison to a natural, healthy adult. I am the tallest of my mother and brother standing at just 5'1"".

As you can see, there is no way for me to protect my family, if something ever did happen. The best I could do is buy my mother and brother time to call the police and run, nothing more before probably being killed with hand to hand fighting. I am scared that one day someone will break into our home and try to steal, kill, or do whatever to my family or home. The only defense and assurance I have that I can protect my family is with a weapon. I realize that there are many here who feel guns are a bad force, but for people like me, they are a great measure of security and relief of anxiety. While I may not be able to stop a 6'5"", buff man, I know a loaded gun will immobilize him.

Today, I am asking for advice from you folks about what handguns would be the best to buy for the purposes of home defense only. My budget is between $200 to $750. I ask for professional gun owners to please give your honest advice about a proper firearm for me.

I have no idea if weight, size, etc matters, but I am, as I said, 5'1"" and weigh 130 pounds. I can lift a considerable amount of weight, but no where near enough weight that my friends can, who are all 5'9"" and over. I do not wish to get into details about my syndrome, as I feel it's a privacy matter; however, any advice for how someone my size can handle a firearm, or the best type of firearm would be greatly appreciated by me. While I do not feel anything will ever happen to my family, I cannot guarantee my families' protection, especially with my dad away.

Please upvote, if you would kindly, so that others may give advice to help me make the best, informed decision.

tl;dr I need a firearm to protect my family, recommendations?

A couple of home invasions, car smash-n-grabs and home burglaries. The wife's car was hit yesterday morning but they got nothing (she keeps nothing in hers, I keep some equestrian stuff in my trunk but you can't open my trunk w/o the key).

House is a 2 story on a slope with a basement that is accessible from the back yard. 7 windows along the front of the house that have window locks to prevent them from opening more than 3"", the same for the basement windows (3). The basement door is older but I have reinforced the strike plate and installed a piece that prevents the lock pin from being cut. There is a large deck in the back, under which is the door to the basement. I always keep the front and rear (above the deck) lights on at night out of habit.

What I plan on doing:
1) motion light over basement door, possibly a motion light inside the basement, which would be handy so if I enter the house via the basement I can see where I'm going.
2) motion lights on side of house near driveway
3) trim shrubs etc away from house and driveway (part of this is done, I have some privet hedge that I can't kill off)
4) blinds in basement (keep people from seeing in). I already have everything put away so you can't see much but out of sight is out of mind.

I have a small safe that is in the basement that I use for documents, it's hidden enough that you could empty out the basement and never find it.

Planning on buying a shotgun then learning how to use it correctly.

Anything to add that I might have missed?

Details and questions inside.,TheMorningDeuce,15,4,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/15tz7v/my_friend_was_recently_nearly_a_victim_of_a_home/,"Last weekend, my friend recently had a situation during which someone attempted to break into his home. Both his girlfriend and 2 year old son were with him in the house when it happened.

He's in the IT field and makes decent money, so he has quite a bit of nice stuff. Earlier this summer, someone actually did break in while they weren't home and stole nearly $4000 worth of electronics/equipment. They didn't make off with all of it (presumably because they couldn't carry any more), so I'm assuming that it's probably the same guy/people that broke in before. After that happened, they purchased and installed a state-of-the-art security system.

It was about 12:30 or 1 in the morning when they heard someone punching in numbers on the keypad at their back door (not sure why you would even try if you didn't know the combination). After that didn't work, they started knocking to try to get someone to answer the door. When no one answered, my friend said he heard a few distinct thumps and then nothing else.

They called the police and they, of course, didn't arrive until the guy was long gone. They were lucky they had the door locked and that his girlfriend had enough sense to not open the door.

My question is about what I should recommend to my friend for protection inside the home in case someone should get past his security system. He's not the type of guy I would encourage to get a firearm as he is on some strong medication, has struggled with personality disorders, and has had no experience with firearms in the past. I also don't feel like he would be responsible or cautious enough with a firearm, especially with a child in the house.

I *did* recommend that he get [Udap bear mace](http://www.bearspray.com/) and keep it somewhere within reach, but I feel like I'm missing something. Also, that it could backfire and incapacitate everyone in the room. 

Is there a better option for defense without a gun? Something effective, yet safe to keep around his family?",,False,self,t5_2sagj,False,,,True,t3_15tz7v,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/15tz7v/my_friend_was_recently_nearly_a_victim_of_a_home/,

* $100/camera
* Semi-weatherproof
* PoE (Power Over Ethernet) means running only 1 cable
* TLS Encryption (HTTPS)
* Ping Watchdog
* Based on Linux, seems like good possibility for modding
* Active forums and community, support is decent
* Fairly wide-angle, good image quality
* Mounting hardware seems pretty solid
* Can define [different zones](http://www.zoneminder.com/sites/zoneminder.com/files/Screenshot-Home%20-%20Zone%20-%20Mozilla%20Firefox.jpg) with independent sensitivity (since NVR software is based on ZoneMinder)

The BAD:

* No night vision.  No infrared.
* Not technically weatherproof
* Motion detection is dependent on the software running on your NVR.  The cameras have NO motion detection alert capability without this.
* NVR hardware not included.  Must use a dedicated PC
* NVR software is BUGGY.  Very much a resource hog.  They seem to be working on updating this.
* Web interface of cameras allows for a very rigid ONE ADMINISTRATOR and ONE READ-ONLY account.  I will experiment with SSHing into the cameras and using ""useradd"".
* Some settings cannot be managed or pushed centrally from the NVR which results in having to log into each camera separately to make certain changes.  Would be handy to push out firmware updates...
* Packet loss on the network causes image to be [distorted](http://forum.ubnt.com/showthread.php?t=53328).  This in turn trips motion alerts (if set) and causes false positives.

Other Notes:

* Cameras are INCREDIBLY light.  Feels a bit cheap.
* Make sure you update EVERYTHING after unboxing.  I experienced countless bugs running the firmware everything shipped with.

Motion detection and alerting is a plus.

Can anyone point me to where to start, in terms of 1) hardware (I'm assuming all I need is an IP camera?) and 2) software? Are IP cameras usually able to send data to a an arbitrary server? The main idea is that I don't want to be hosting the videos in the same place the camera is set up.

1) record to USB or SD type media

2) get a decent picture through a window

We need something we can move around between vacant apartments to get views that our permanent cameras don't to catch dumpers, people that have been banned from the property, kids chucking rocks at cars, etc..

We would fab up or use a tripod of some sort to hold the camera(s) and they would be placed set back from the window with the blinds canted to allow viewing out.

As far as I can tell, a camera that has night vision capabilities should either have a switch for the IR lights or we would have to cover them to avoid window glare.

I also assume we need some sort of manual focus to avoid getting a really pretty shot of the window blinds.

Wired vs wireless isn't really a concern because we can drop cables wherever in a vacant unit.

Other than viewing distance, is there any difference between indoor/outdoor?

Lorex seems to make decent cameras at the price point we are looking at. Any specific ideas for their stuff or any other brands?

I keep it locked in a safe, where I only know the combination, I do not keep it loaded, and I am about to take a gun safety course.

What should I do?,TabbyCaterpillar,17,5,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/1kf2ba/someone_broke_in_to_my_new_home_and_stole_all_the/,"I bought this house about 2 months ago and it has been vacant for almost a year. We are having renovations done, and the guys started demoing just today. They are expected to be finished in about 6 weeks. Yesterday I was at the house and found out that someone had broken in through the back window and went down to the basement and ripped out all of the copper piping. 

I'm concerned that they might come back to get more copper piping in the walls, which I have read is something that can happen. This would be even worse because we'd have to repair the walls in addition to replacing the pipes. 

My first thought is that I should set up a security system, with outside lights and cameras. I looked on Angie's List and can get a deal from GuardMe Security for $89. Here are the details:

&gt; GuardMe Security, a Page Of Happiness Nominee on Angie's List, is offering a complete professional installation of a GE Wireless Alarm system, including Cellular Communicator with integration with your existing smart phone for only $89! This alarm package is normally $499 saving Angie’s List members $410!

&gt; No home phone required for installation. You will receive a complete parameter protection system including up to 10 wireless door/window sensors, 1 keypad, 1 motion detector, 1 cellular communicator, 1 battery backup, 1 yard sign, window decals and an insurance certificate.

&gt; This offer is for the installation of a new system along with a monitoring agreement starting at $39.95 per month is required. 

So this would not have any cameras or lighting included, but would have all of the windows and doors covered. 

If I get this deal, should I also get cameras and lights? I will probably install outside lights anyway, but we hadn't done that yet because we aren't living there at the moment while renovations are being done. Should I get motion sensor lights, or just timed lights that go on right before sunset? 

One other question, about the window sensors included in that GuardMe package... There are 12 windows and 2 doors in my house so which 4 windows should I leave unprotected? I would think the top two in the front, because if someone is going to break in on the second floor, chances are they won't try it on the street side, right? But which other 2? Or should I just buy sensors for the 4 so that every entry to the house is protected?

Please give me any advice. I am feeling completely violated and upset that someone did this to my home. I don't want to overreact and go overboard with security, but I do live in the city and break-ins aren't uncommon so I definitely want to be protected.",,False,self,t5_2sagj,False,,,True,t3_1kf2ba,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/1kf2ba/someone_broke_in_to_my_new_home_and_stole_all_the/,

More importantly, it had to be contract free and cost effective.  SimpliSafe fits the bill pretty well.  

**Pricing:**  $15/mo monitoring, $5 for smart alerts.  For my system that included 3 entry sensors, 1 motion detector, and an extra keychain remote it was only about $275.  You only get what you need.  
  
**Overview:**  SimpliSafe is pretty simple.  They send you wireless modules for whatever you order.  Entry sensors, motion sensors, etc.  Everything has 2 sided tape already applied, which has held up just fine for over 2 months.  No falling sensors, even on doors.  Also, the batteries are already installed.  Besides the sensors, you get a pretty standard keypad, a keychain USB remote that is used to program the system, and the base station.  The base station houses the GSM radio and is really the ""brains"" of the thing.  It is the only part that plugs into power, but it of course has a backup battery.
  
**Setup:**  I had the whole thing setup in 15 minutes. From my wheelchair (broken ankle). It doesn't have anything fancy, the whole thing is really based around simplicity. You plug in the USB keychain to your computer to configure it. You can set the time you have to turn it off on both the ""Home"" and ""Away"" modes, as well as turn on or off door chimes, voice alerts, etc.
Speaking of the ""Home"" and ""Away"" modes, they each have unique settings. So you can turn off the motion detectors while your home. The best part of this is doing all this config on an easy to use website interface. You don't have to mess with a keypad.
The alarm on the base station isn't quite loud enough. If you do get this thing, make sure to get an additional siren. They're $59.99 I think.
I hid the base station behind the couch, because I wouldn't want an intruder messing with it. I'm not sure whether or not I want to put up the stickers and signs, because I wouldn't want to give anything away to a smart thief.  I do not know if you were to destroy the base station in a fire or something if it would still call the police.   My only worry with the system, really.  I'll try to find out about this and update.
Our base station is downstairs, and I've been setting the alarm at night with my remote from our bedroom upstairs. So the range is pretty good.    Adding and configuring additional modules is a breeze as well.  
    
**Monitoring:** Once you've got everything setup, you login to the website to activate the monitoring.  Once done, they put the system in ""practice mode"" for 72 hours.  This gives you time to trip the alarm and work out the kinks, they will not call you during this period if your alarm goes off.  You will however have to send them a test message to make sure the GSM is working.  You will see if it went through on the event log on their website, which logs all events and activity for you.  The next day after I did this, SimpliSafe gave me a ring to let me know the test signal went through fine and to make sure I didn't have any questions.  Very nice. The website also has an easy to download certificate to give to your home insurance peeps. 
  
**Smart Alerts:**  I signed up for these for an extra $5 a month.  They are really cool, and completely configurable.  First you add the people you want to be alerted and their emails and phone numbers.  These are then confirmed (they send you codes to enter).  After that, you can setup alerts for each email and phone number.  You can choose whether to send alarm, activity, and/or error messages.  For instance, I only have Alarm and Error texting my phone, while all 3 are sent to my email where it just filters them and archives them.  My wife only gets Alarm messages.  The website is very easy to use to do this by the way.   
   
**TL:DR:** SimpliSafe is cheap and simple but performs exactly how they say.  I would order the additional alarm however, the base alone is not loud enough if you have a house.  The online setup is easy and had more features than I expected.  If you want a completely wireless system a monkey could setup and you don't need added complexity of cameras etc, go with SimpliSafe.  **shadowinq Approved**

I am trying to prevent a break in through it.  Last year one of my neighbors had their house broken into by someone kicking in their front door.  This is no surprise as the houses in this neighborhood came with a kind of cheap doors and locks, and deadbolt latch receiver was pathetic with really short screws.  

I have taken two steps to try to enhance door security so far:
1. Added a custom build steel bar to the door frame with multiple 4"" wood screws going into the stud that accepts the deadbolt and door handle latch.
2. Added a much better deadbolt with a non-standard key type to prevent bump-key break ins or other lock picking attempts.  

Aside from general comments, I have two questions:
1. How likely is it that an intruder might try to break that center stained glass to unlatch the door, and how easy would that be to do since it has some metal in it?
2. The door is light weight and to my horror, today I discovered that it actually has styrofoam in the middle it that I saw when installing the new deadbolt.  So I'm afraid that this door is dreadfully weak.  If I want to replace this door with something more solid, with no center window, can I attach a new door to this existing frame or do I have to buy the door+frame and redo the work I did installing that metal bar into my current frame?  That took a lot of chisel work is why I'm asking, I'd rather not do it again unless necessary but I will if I have to.

edit 1: This is my first post ever to Reddit, so hopefully I did things right... if I messed anything up please correct me, thanks!

edit 2: I made a gallery here of how I custom build a strike plate to prevent a frame breaking kick in, now I'm just worried about the door itself.  http://imgur.com/a/nWgEb",,False,self,t5_2sagj,True,,,True,t3_m12ad,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/m12ad/home_front_door_reinforcement_advice_needed/,

Now we're getting contradicting info on burglary deterrence from different sources.

The cops say that a combination of clearly visible security cameras along with an alarm system is best.

The insurance appraiser says that cameras are useless, that burglars will just wear a mask or hood and break in anyway, even though the folks who broke into their house were only wearing sunglasses (neighbor's CCTV caught them). He advises a loud, audible alarm.

Full disclosure: I'm in favor of CCTV+loud, audible alarm. That way in the case of a false alarm my parents can log in remotely and disable the alarm after checking the cameras. 


So my question: are there any high quality studies that have shown whether CCTV and alarms work to prevent crime (never mind catching criminals after or during the act). The goal here is to deter. My father is a scientist, so good peer reviewed studies will help him make his decision on what to invest in.

But as I think through the practicalities, I just don't see how the protection outweighs the risk. I have a young child (4 yrs) and am quite concerned about a shooting accident. I know how clever and snooping kids can be (when older) e.g. they can know about everything in your house and figure out a way to get a key to a gun lock or whatever, and of course they can be very stupid. It seems like having a gun in the house would require me to lock it up so tightly that by the time I needed it I'd still be futzing around trying to get it unlocked, loaded, etc. 

So please give me your arguments. I know very little about guns but if I decide to get one would do the research, get the training, etc. Realistically, I probably wouldn't go to a range more than a couple times a year after initial training. After thinking about it as described above I decided that a gun was not a reasonable option for me, and have been thinking of getting some sort of large knife instead, but before finalizing that decision I'd love to hear your thoughts. Thanks in advance for the time.



EDIT:
Thanks all, this is really helpful. Comments on knives are illuminating. Shot gun is seeming like a good solution for me as long as I keep it absolutely secure. I don't trust children, there are too many examples of parents that think their children are smart when they aren't, or think they're children are trustworthy when they aren't. That said, your comments about educating your kids are very well taken and are obvious in hindsight - in fact, I think that may be why I'm so worried about child safety is that my Dad taught me about gun safety when I was a kid and really put the fear of god in me on how easily something could go wrong if you mishandle them.

One thing missing from these arguments (and please just take this as some friendly advice on how to deal with liberal gun-fearing folk like me) is any hard data. It's easy to say ""if an intruder comes in to kill you with a gun, you'll die if you don't have one"", but that would be a much stronger argument if there was reliable data (and I'm just making stuff up now for sake of example) that 2% of deaths each year were due to home invasions, or that 5% of people with guns in the house end up actually ever using them for personal safety. You may disagree and say ""it only takes once"" but there always risks on the other side - that your kid ends up shooting himself, or you shoot yourself or a cop or your wife. E.g. if there was a real stat that said ""1% of gun owners end up stopping an intruder, but 5% of gun owners end up with a family member shot"" that kind of math just wouldn't pan out. Maybe the issue is so controversial that reliable statistics just aren't out there.

Wat?) I want to set up a camera system to cover my front of my house, my driveway, and my back of my house.

I live in a generally quiet neighborhood of crime, but next door lives a pair of drug addicts (dealers too I think ) that the cops have frequently visited.  Aside from a few run ins of loudness in front of my house, nothing terrible has happened but recently I discovered they are opening my front gate (its short and hopable anyway) and coming inside.  They apparently have done this 3x now according to a neighbor.  Last night they also did something really strange and left some flowers that they ripped from someone's yard next to my tenant's driver side door of her car on the ground.

Shit is getting really strange, and while we are going to the precinct (there's been multiple times cops have been called to this house so shouldn't be a big deal), there's nothing I can do to prove they were there while we slept except take the word of the other neighbor.  

Thus, I want to set up some cameras, but I am torn between these kits they sell, or simply buying some IP cameras and software.  I work in IT, and run a server etc in the house with storage I can use or dedicate to this.  I also know generally the source of the trouble so I'm not too concerned with super high resolution facial capabilities as I can track them back to the entrance, but I'm looking to get at least 4 cameras (8 would be better).  Most will be placed on my roof and I have a pipe running there for wires for my other antennas, but coax will be tight to fit through there. Cat5 is far easier, but wireless might even be ideal.  

I've read through the links on the side, but am unsure if it's worth buying a few outdoor cams and running my own software or buying a DVR kit.  Most of those appear to be unfortunately coax or thicker cables only.  I also worry then about being locked into a specific company.

Suggestions? Thanks in advance all.

I mean, how do I know the thing will actually work?

Could anyone here ElI5 how fire safes work? And also if you have any recommendations on what's the best or how to find the best, I'd appreciate it.

I figure its something I'll have for a long time so I don't mind going a little high-end-- after all, the only time you're really gonna need it you NEED it to work.

Or if anyone has any other ides of safe places you can put vital documents so that there's a solid chance of them withstanding a fire (*besides* the internet or a hard drive-- I'm talking paper here), that would also be interesting to me.

**Update:**

Round-up of thread so far:

--I'm not concerned about theft here... just trying to get something DEFINITELY fireproof... waterproof would be a bonus.

--The best safe I've come across so far: [First Alert 2040F Water/Fire Media Safe](http://www.amazon.com/First-Alert-2040F-Water-Media/dp/B000GB0K8U/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340908250&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=media+fire+safe)

--Possible alternative option? [Fire-proof bag (manufacturer link)](http://www.firepouch.com/) + [amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Pouch-Resistant-Proof-Cash/dp/B003K7IM78/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340907744&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=fire+resistant+pouch)

--I'm not looking for something very big-- I think equivalent of a standard manilla envelope would suffice.

--Planning to use it for: paper docs, small notebook, passport, cheque book, spare cell phone, hard drive, flash drives or sd cards, and maybe a spare cable... basically the things I think I'd absolutely NEED if it looked like everything else was gone. FWIW the idea behind the spare cell phone isn't so much that I'd have a phone-- although there's that-- but I have an old htc that can take pics and save them to sd and I figure if I was ever dealing with destroyed property first thing I'd want is a camera-- and bonus, it can take notes and connect to wifi-- so even without a data plan I could still use it to call people (google voice) and email, look stuff up, etc. from anyplace with wifi.

--I don't really want to go over $200 but I have some wiggle  room.

--Interesting ideas so far:

* from [packer64](http://www.reddit.com/user/packer64): check actuary tables, check safe makers at county fair

* from everyone: get at least a thirty minute rating, [russianbotnetlord](http://www.reddit.com/user/russianbotnetlord) recommends at least an hour (per. US house fire average burn time)

* don't bother with big box stores (yea you guys are right about that)

Anyone have any good recommendations for glass vibration/glass break alarms? The magnetic separation alarms don't work because 1) it's not easy to mount, given the way the window frame is designed, and 2) it doesn't help with someone throwing a brick through the window.

EDIT: Something low-to-mid range, that will just make a really loud alarm sound when the alarm gets tripped, so it can either 1) if I'm home, wake me up and give me time to grab my gun, or 2) if I'm not home, alert the neighbors and scare the burglar away.

I've lived in a 2 unit apartment/house (in an unfamiliar city) for 9 months now.  It has always felt ""safe"" to me.  The neighborhood is pretty quiet and the people around me are nice and keep to themselves.  I'm just outside of downtown (walking distance) which itself is somewhat low-income/worrisome to walk around if you are alone at night.

1st bad event - 
Just recently we had Winter Storm Alfred which knocked out half the power to Connecticut (my state).  The girl above me (who is a US Army Reserve active soldier) installed a portable generator after the storm for power.  Apparently, some punks tried stealing the generator right off our back deck!  She woke up to the sound of them trying to uninstall it, she quickly ran out there with her gun and scared them off.

2nd Event - 
Yesterday, my upstairs neighbor found that her truck got broken into.  They took everything she owned that was in the truck, including:  GPS, jewelry, Army gear, school books.  My car, which was right next to it, was unscathed - however I feel it has something to do with the fact that my car looks new and nice, and has a visible alarm.  Her truck was just slim-jimed open and had no alarm.  The cops said they might come back for more.

These two recent events have me doubting the neighborhood I live in, and have me worried.  I just found this subreddit and read around for a bit.  Does /r/homedefense have any simple easy things I can do to up my home defense and instill some confidence?  So far,  I like the idea of a wireless camera out in the driveway/entrances, and the scotchguard window film.  I also have a dog but she's a cupcake (30 pound border collie), and i'm 26 so gun ownership is possible.

I was thinking I would position the cameras as follows:

One watching my front door, but positioned off to the far left side of my door.  This would put it in someone's peripheral vision if they were looking at my front door.

One pointed out towards my driveway/street.  This one may be placed next to the one watching my front door.

The other two I could mount up high on the side of my house watching the 2 gates to the back yard.  Both gates are 6ft tall and I keep them both pad locked at all times.

Thoughts?  An alternative I thought to watching the gates was to watch the 2 rear doors of the house.

Concealment ideas?  Since it's a single story really my only choice if I want to monitor each door and even the street is to mount under the overhang of the roof.

We've had it for about a year now. I didn't do my research when buying the system and regret it. It's landline based and, after looking online, seems to have overpriced monthly fees. However, we live in a townhouse in a low-crime area, so I'm not terribly worried about how effective the system is. My assumption is that most people will pass on a house with the security system sign and go to one without.

So, I now have an out. ADT recently decided to raise the monthly rate - which I nearly went apeshit about since we're IN A 3 YEAR CONTRACT. I read through the contract and there is a clause stating that they can do this, but we had 30 days to object in writing before we could cancel without penalty. 30 days later, and I should be free to cancel!

So, my question is this: what would you all recommend that I do? I know that there are companies that can take over monitoring, but I can't seem to find one with good reviews. We live in Northern VA.

For one, if my apartment is burglarized and they steal my computer, my evidence goes right along with them. Second, I don't want to leave my PC on and running while I'm away. 

* When emailing motion-activated snapshots to you, do you receive them relatively quickly? Would these cameras enable me to inform the police of a break-in quickly enough for them to respond?

The builder of our home currently has a system from [2gig](http://www.2gig.com/) set up. Couple of door and motion sensors inside. The controller has a GSM radio, and calls out to a monitoring group in our area. I am beginning to think if the controller has a cell capabilities, I can probably fix those capabilities without the kind of jerry-rigging the OBI+Skylink required. I really like this idea for my own monitoring system in the same vein - hooked into my Google Voice and constantly monitoring my own system. These 2gig systems even have phone apps to control various portions of it while away, as well.

Anyone have experience with these 2gig getups? If the capability of controlling the outbound calls exist, any ideas if I can tweak it to any number I want?

My basic goal is to build an expandable system that will record foot and vehicle activity on the property to a local computer that I will check daily (no internet access available however). Some cameras will be located near buildings but others will have to be isolated in areas such as on a tree.

**Basic Setup Idea:**

1. Initially 3 outdoor cameras that can be concealed with a good enough quality that I can make out faces and license plates out to 30 or so meters. Motion sensing ability to trigger video recording would be a plus.

2. Wifi setup to avoid having to run additional cables. Most cameras would be within 20 meters of the base station but some may be placed out to 50 meters away.

3. A computer I’d build myself that would run the surveillance monitoring software and store the videos. 

I can handle the computer requirements myself. As far as monitoring software it looks like the open source iSpyconnect.com software would fulfill my needs. I am not looking to spend a whole bunch of money, probably around $2,000 with around $600 budgeted to computer costs.

I've set up a generic Chinese 4 channel CCTV DVR in a currently unoccupied house.  I can access it remotely using standard software like NetDVR.  My issue is that the network connection is quite slow at the location.  It's fine for watching the streams live, but when I try to download any of the recorded files via the usual Net DVR clients, they frequently fail to download.

Is anyone here aware of a batch tool which I can set up to repeatedly poll for and download any stored video from the DVR?

I'm not sure what protocol the NetDVR client uses.  I've tried toestablish a manual connection to the open ports, but can't get through, however the Net DVR client can show me a file list and make an attempt at downloading the files.  I've tried connecting to the same port using both FTP and SSH, but the DVR keeps closing the connection.

TLDR Anyone know of a (windows, ideally, but linux might work too) script to continually poll for and download new videos from a remote DVR?",,False,self,t5_2sagj,False,,,True,t3_wre7w,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/wre7w/remotely_download_video_from_cctv_dvr/,

At that time, there were not a whole lot of options for wireless, so the cameras were hardwired in. We live on a large property, and so we have a total of five, and everything is being run to a DVR/monitor in our mechanical room. It's not the most ideal situation, because it would be ideal to be able to see the video on the other TV screens in the home, but we've tried a lot of things, with no luck. The way the wiring is set up, and the way the cable is being run to the TV's, we get too much interference using channel modulators and what not. It works, and this is the best we can do for now.

However, we would like to be able to have a camera installed at the front door, so we can view it in the kitchen. This doesn't have to have recording capability, and doesn't need to be run to the DVR. Just a simple, camera that broadcasts an image to an external monitor, or our small 26 inch TV in the kitchen. Majority of our family's time is spent in the kitchen/family room and so it would be ideal to be able to view who's at the front door without walking up to it, since it's all glass. The distance from the front door to the kitchen/family room is probably about 20-30 feet if that matters.

Any ideas??

**Edit** I probably should've added this in the post title, but additionally - our home sits about 300 feet or so along the driveway, from the front entry gate. We currently have a dome camera hardwired in on the wall, which records who enters the gate. Again though, as I mentioned above, we have no way of seeing in real time, who's coming through the gate unless we're in the mechanical room, which is upstairs. Not exactly convenient to run upstairs and check each time someone is at the gate. The gate is operated by a call box, which the person calls in on, and rings to our home line, and we can open the gate. Sometimes though, I'll leave for work, and my wife or mom will be upstairs, and a UPS delivery, or pool cleaner calls at the gate. They'll open it for them, but only are able to go by what the person says on the other line. We've had a couple of instances where their voice will be muffled from the sound of their engine or our neighbors lawn mower, so this is a concern. It would be ideal to be able to see them at the gate before pressing *9 to open the gate. Is there any simple and easy way to broadcast an image similar to what I'm looking for above in the kitchen?

NetworX NX-6V2.  I never had it activated and to be honest i dont think they ever told me the codes.  I just let it sit there and beep whenever i opened a door or window.


So last night i decided in my brilliance that i would try to turn the door chime off, since my girlfriend was asleep on the couch.  Long story short i set the alarm off.  I had to disconnect the power and battery to stop the alarm since i do not know the codes (or apparently how to work the thing).


I have found the install manuals and user guides online, and am optimistic the default codes are in place.  However, what is going to happen when i power this back on?


Will the alarm go off?

Will the system be in some sort of tripped status?

Is it ok to unhook the alarm while i get it sorted out?


I just want my door/window chime back :(

I just need something solid and simple that works with multiple cameras, records motion, and is accessible from a web browser and from an iPhone (preferably with a custom iPhone app). 

Here are the ones I've tried:

- Active Webcam - ok. inexpensive. don't think it can be accessed from iPhone.
- Argus Surveillance DVR 4.0.exe - cheesy.
- SupervisionCam 3.2.2.2 - web server doesn't serve video? not many features.
- Watcher 2.34 - Can't figure it out.
- EyeSoft 2.3.12b - slow / cheesy.
- LuxRiot DVR 1.7.5 - confusing.  might be ok, couldn't figure it out.
- Willing Webcam 5.2 - $60 didn't use much, but seems cheesy / not very good.
- LiveStream Broadcaster 5.4 - specific to livestream, probably not what we need.
- Visionica 1 51 - cloud based?  
- H264 WebCam Pro - weird, cheesy.
- WebCam Looker 5.4 - didn't work. looks cheesy.
- Security Monitor Pro - $90/170.  IP or USB cameras only? has broadcast... for web browser? 
- WebCam Monitor 5.24 - good?  good frame rate.  couldn't get broadcast to work -&gt; windows media player only. $70. Only 1 camera at a time?
- i-Catcher Console - Fairly decent software but outrageously expensive. 
- SKJM iCam - Mostly a phone app with desktop component.  Didn't work well with our camera, seems to work best with directly connected USB cams.

Haven't tried yet:

- iSpy - Requires an expensive subscription for mobile access.  Haven't tried it yet.
- WebcamXP - haven't tried yet, Lifehacker recommends it.

Now, I have siamese BNC Video/Power cables pre-wired at a new residential home build at each location.  My question is: When I go to screw in the black/red power leads into the green camera connector, is it OK to ""shove"" the bundle of wires behind the camera and then mount it?  I guess I am a little worried about fire hazards and such.  

I do plan to flush mount 2 of them and I plan to cut into the truss above the garage, so the bundle of wires would essentially be dangling behind the camera into the attic.

Does that make sense?  Am I overly cautious here?  Any help or tips for first time CCTV installer would be greatly appreciated.

http://foscam.us/products/foscam-fi8608w-wireless-ip-camera.html


&gt;The Key differences between Foscam FI8608W and FI8910W

&gt;-The FI8608W features H.264 video compression as opposed to the
FI8910W which uses MJPEG video compression. H.264 compression
significantly reduces the file sizes of the images up to 10x
without sacrificing quality. This allows you to reduce bandwidth
consumption, increase FPS as well as save hard drive space for
video recordings and snapshots.

&gt;-The FI8608W features a Built-in DVR via onboard SD Card slot
allowing you to save video and images directly on the camera
itself. The SD Card slot supports upto 32gb SD cards. The FI8910W
has no onboard SD Card slot.

&gt;-The FI8608W uses improved G.711 audio compression to further
reduce bandwidth consumption, increase audio quality and reduce
interference/feedback. The FI8910W uses older ADPCM audio
compression technology

I'm interested mostly in IP cameras since they offer higher resolution recording. Although, since the cameras will be used mainly at the entrance points, an analog system may be sufficient.  But for now, I'm looking mostly for IP camera setups.

* I really only need max 4 cameras to cover the front and back entrances.  Three cameras would probably be sufficient as well.
* The areas are lighted but if night vision is available, it would be great in case someone decided to unscrew a light bulb.
* The environment the cameras will be in is unheated but they will not be directly exposed to the outside elements. (I'm around Chicago so it gets cold here)
* Preferred wired cameras 
* There is no access to a computer in the building so the system would need some sort of DVR that I could stash somewhere.  I see that a lot of the analog systems have a DVR that I could hook up a monitor to and access that way but I'm having trouble finding an equivalent kit that uses IP cameras.  Also, internet access to the DVR won't be required at all.


I'd prefer buying a kit since I don't really want to mix and match but if that is the only route, then so be it.  

As far as budget goes, lets try to keep it in the realm of reasonable with an absolute max of $1500.

We had a local security system company come out and wire a system up with basic door, window, motion and smoke sensors when we bought the house.  It was connected to a phone line.  A few years ago we canceled our monitoring service and phone line due to financial issues.  We would like to get another system set up.  Here is what I've been looking at.
The company that we bought it from is out of business.  I could contract with another local company to come out, reconfigure it and pay them a monthly monitoring service ~30-35/month.  I would have to also sign up for phone service, or probably purchase new equipment to use internet or cellular.  Most of these come with a multiple year contract.
I was on the phone with comcast for an unrelated issue and asked about their Home Security service.  In short it would be $99 install $39/month with 3yr contract.  They said they could probably utilize my sensors but would use their panel.  Connection would be internet with cell backup, so no phone line needed.
I'm also looking at companies like simplisafe and front point security which is basically buy the equipment, install yourself.  Everything is wireless.  I haven't gotten prices from these yet, but my guess is that I would need to buy all new equipment.
I was leaning to going with Comcast, because the install fee wasn't bad, they can (supposedly) use my sensors and wouldn't need to buy extras, no phone line, receive txt on any alarm, and I can monitor and control from an app.  However, I haven't seen great reviews online.  Most of the complaints are about customer service and the 3yr contract.  I have had internet with them for 10+ years and it has been outstanding and I have always had good customer service from them, unlike most.
What would you guys do?  Any thoughts or opinions are appreciated.

There is a hook up spot above some windows for glass breaking detection, but no detectors in place.  There is no control panel.

How hard would it be to install a non-monitored alarm system in my house?  And more importantly, how expensive?  I'd like to try it myself if there is money to be saved, as it's not vital or time critical that i install such a system, it is more of a ""would be nice"" type of thing.  The reason i don't want it monitored is because I have a lot of neighbors on all sides of my house who will probably look to see what's going on long before the monitoring company would even call the cops, also I'm cheap and don't want another monthly bill, and I live in a pretty safe area so it's really not necessary (also i don't have a land phone line activated).

So far as my background which would help with this project: I have worked as a non-licensed electronics technician at a theme park (mainly fixed games, outlets, audio, and lighting) a little over a decade ago, so I do have a decent understanding of electrical hook ups, etc.  I just don't have any experience hooking up alarms.

If anyone can point me where to buy a decent control panel for the system at a fair price and some other info it would be much appreciated!  Thanks.

Get ready for a long post that goes well beyond the usual home defense plan, but will hopefully give you a great deal of information. 

To those TL;DR types, shotgun and blades are the only home defense weapon I will use. Rifle and pistol rounds go too far if you miss. To the bird shot fans, I've been peppered with some idiots distant bird shot on 3 occasions, all 3 times it didn't even penetrate my winter wear. Alternate between 00 buck and slugs in your tube and keep it locked in a QR safe before you go to bed every night. If you have kids, get the idea of home defense with guns out of your mind unless you have a very thorough plan and weekly range time. Too many times people get their family killed/tortured/raped trying to play the role of hero because they bought a pistol and went to the range every 3-6 months. Now for the long part and my home security plan:

An overwhelming majority of break-ins occur during sleep hours by people with zero motivation to actually harm the people living in the home. Are you going to be able to wake up, grab your gun, find them, aim, shoot in the time the person breaking in can get to you or a member of your family? Really time yourself and practice things like this. Have someone unexpectedly wake you up from a dead sleep in the middle of the night and run the clock. If you can't handily beat the clock in a groggy state of mind hands down then having a home defense weapon is a waste that increases your chances of something awful happening to your family or you in the event of a B&amp;E.

Your best home defense is having a plan. Exiting the house is job 1. Contingency plans need to be hiding places that can be accessed quickly and silently with a GPS located cell phone dialed to 911. Confrontation should be your last ditch effort, with firearms behind that. 

In my family whether it was fire, tornadoes, break-ins, floods, there was always a plan we knew with any number of contingencies. We also practiced it monthly to make sure we knew what to do. My father would always quiz us, throwing the ever-present Mr. Murphy in to make us think fast and react fast. It's a trend I've continued, brought to the family I love now, and considered when setting up my home.

Here's my strategy and why:

I have a 1/5 acre lot in a closely built 1950s suburban neighborhood 1/4 mile to the downtown of my city. Police, fire and medical help are all within seconds of getting my address from a dispatcher. I've already limited my exposure by proximity to response. 

My home is a bungalow with a dormer on the back of the house. My main floor is easily accessible with a glass door wall in the back and multiple windows large enough for a person to get through in a hurry. Solution: privacy fence to hide the door wall from sight of people casing the neighborhood. I keep my shades at the front of the house drawn 95% of the time to prevent visibility to the floorplan and what I have inside.  The biggest advantage you have in a break in is that it’s your house and they don't know where they're going. Anyways the glass door walls are very inviting targets since their locks suck and you can typically derail the whole door portion with minimal noise. If my house ever got broken into that would be the most likely point of entry for that and its isolation from any neighbors seeing the act. I also have steel core doors and overbuilt frames around the additional entrances.

Final deterrent step, motion sensor security lights my security dog with ""WARNING SECURITY DOG"" sign the door wall warning of such. The sign is not gaudy or something people see when they're driving/walking through the neighborhood.  I don’t want to make people wonder what I feel the need to secure, however there's no way to miss it once you get to the back yard no matter how dark it is.

If someone ignores the sign, gets through the door without alerting me, I know my dog will wake me and there will be quite a commotion buying my family precious seconds. (to any experienced dog owners out there I’ve had about every breed you can think of GSD/Bel Mal, dobies, rotts, mastiffs, terriers, etc. and I'll only have a Rhodesian Ridgeback personal protection dog for the rest of my life. They’re definitely not for inexperienced owners though) Once alerted my lady knows exactly where to go hide, her phone is bedside fully charged and programmed to GPS trace with 911 and she takes the 9mm Mk24 P226. If you've never been in my house before, you could ransack the place and never find her.

So assume all this has failed, the perp really wants my stuff or is just a creep out for blood. Now comes my favorite part of my home renovation efforts - my Alamo master suite.  The small size of my place blocks any reasonable exit without confrontation in the event of a break in. The entire upper floor is the master suite, but it has a very unique twist. I renovated to wall off one entire side of the stairway exit and turned it into the walk in closet to the bedroom portion of the house. Around the stairwell are wooden pillared railing obstructing movement but allowing me to see clearly. Essentially said perp will have to run up a flight of 20+ steps with their back to me, make a 180* turn, run down another alleyway of 10+ yards on the opposite side of the bungalow portion, and then try and find us in the bedroom/bathroom/library area.

During that time if the perp is still coming for us he's hurt/killed my dog and I've probable cause that my family and I are imminently threatened.  It's like a shooting gallery and my PDW is a Rem 870 tac with a couple toys on it. If perps are still moving and get to me I prefer bladed weapons to handguns for CQB.

Now the most important part, the legal ramifications, I live in Michigan and we have castle doctrine where violent crime in your home is defendable with deadly force. All I need to tell the officer is the perp said they were going to kill me and I'm in the clear. It's critical to check with your local and state laws though so you know what to expect after the fact and don't end up sending yourself to jail because you said the wrong thing in heat of the moment. Even so, I'd rather be tried by twelve than carried by six.

If you bothered reading this you can tell I put a significant amount of thought and months of work into the setup of my home. I don't think someone should have to compromise on the subject of security and comfort. It is my castle, I hope I'll never have to defend it, but if I do I am confident we'll be all right.

What I don't know is how I'd react if the door alarm went off in the middle of the night.  I'm a pretty heavy sleeper, but there have been times where I've been woken up by something important and felt pretty wide-awake.

What I'd like to do is drill.  I want to practice being woken up in the middle of the night and reacting to a home invasion scenario.  A few ideas I've had, of varying levels of practicality:

1) Get an extra door alarm and rig up an Arduino-based device to randomly set it off in the middle of the night, and measure how long it takes me to come and press a button on the device.

2) Have a shooting-based video game paused on the TV, and when the alarm in (1) goes off, see how I do at it compared to when I'm wide-awake.

3) Have a sleepover at the local gun range, with an alarm clock that will wake me up (and having a friend set it so I won't know what it's set for).  Lets me test my actual shooting skills while half-awake.  

Thoughts?

They came through our front door. Apparently since our door is wood, they shoved something between where the lock meets the frame and worked it until it hit the lock. From what we can tell, they kicked the door a few times which caused the deadbolt to break and were able to just pull on the deadbolt with whatever they shoved between the frame and door to unlock it afterwards. There was not structural damage to the door frame and the door just had chips where they dug in. We were recommended to put a steel plate in the wall where the deadbolt slides in. This would prevent the door from giving in a little while kicking it. Additionally we put a wrap-around door plate so they couldn't jam anything between the door and frame. Finally, we switched alarm companies to Vivint since they had a pretty good offer at the time. Since doing all this, it appears someone has again tried to get in, but was unsuccessful.

I have a suspicion of who broke into the house, but no concrete proof. My family has seen this man a few times around the neighborhood which has set off several alarms in our heads, but no evidence that he was the one who broke in or attemped to break in again. So we are still very cautious and are in need of some advice. With vivint, we got 2 IP cameras. Niether have night vision and the quality is extremely lacking, but they are included at no cost in our package, so we have them. We have one pointing out at our driveway and we have a fairly old motion light out there as well. This light acts very funny in that it isn't consistently on or off and motion trigger doesn't work very well. It also doesn't obey any of the timings set on it and the fact that the settings are on the body of the camera is worrisome to me anyway. This light causes my camera to record many times throughout the night which has caused us to largely ignore the recording notifications which is the opposite of what I want.

I have considered replacing this vivint camera with a proper outdoor camera, but the problem I have seen with many outdoor cameras is that you can fairly easily unplug them or totally remove them and steal them. This is obviously not ideal. We would need a camera where the wires are not visible and the camera was not easily removed. As for the faulty light, I am going to replace it, but was wondering if there is a better all in one solution for light and camera. I've done a little searching online and found a few, but no ratings or customer feedback.

Can anyone recommend a good solution here? If not a good light/camera combo, can anyone recommend a good IP camera with nightvision on it. I don't want it to record all the time, but would rather it be motion activated (say with a 15-45 second buffer). With the vivint cameras, I can set a zone of the recordable area to record and a sensitivity threshold. Since mine is facing down my driveway which eventually hits the street, this is mandatory for a motion trigger. Ideally, I would like to record directly to a home server I have and have the ability to view these recordings online. If the second part doesn't exist, don't worry to much, I can write something in my spare time to do that.

It is probably worth noting that I do not currently have a DVR. Vivint's IP cameras record and store directly to their servers. I've been curious about intercepting that data since it goes through my router and storing it locally as well, but haven't attempted to do so yet.",,False,self,t5_2sagj,False,,,True,t3_wg2if,http://www.reddit.com/r/homedefense/comments/wg2if/looking_for_a_good_cameralight_solution/,

I need help with setting up a camera system.  I have an old factory which is being converted to a warehouse.  While I do have an alarm system, the camera systems the offer are, in my opinion, of low quality and cost quite a bit to instal.  I'd like to know what I would have to do to build a top notch setup.

Thing's I'd like:

- 8 outdoor cameras
- 720p resolution minimum (color/no color doesn't matter)
- high low light visibility (the land lord is being very difficult with regards to extra lighting)

Here is where I enter uncharted waters.  Obviously I need a computer and monitor to run everything which is easy enough, but what kind of hardware and software would I need to drive the cameras.  Also, I was wondering if there is any kind of motion tracking program that could be part of the system.  I have Witness for my home computer which automatically sends me alerts with stills and videos if there is any motion in front of the camera, but I'm not sure that software would be up to the task of outdoor video.  Also, about how much HDD space would I need to hold say, a weeks worth of footage?

Basically, I recently became a sales rep for Vivint, and i'm wondering what you all think of their equipment, their system, their business model, etc.

I see a lot of you here are into the DIY systems. For those of you that don't know, Vivint is a competitor to ADT. Our systems don't use the home phone line, have two way voice over the cell, and you can control everything with your phone. Honestly, I used to have ADT in my house, and now I have Vivint (how I got the job), and I see a huge improvement.

Feel free to ask questions, leave comments or criticisms, everything will help. Check out our website (vivint.com) and some of our videos if you want (http://www.youtube.com/vivinthome).

And I guess I might as well shamelessly plug myself. If you are looking for an alarm system, I'd be more than happy to help.

I'm looking to install a wireless system because I'm generally too lazy to hardwire all the sensors I'll need.  Plus, ground floor alone has 4 door entries and 12 window entries, so i'll need a LOT of sensors!

So what I'm looking for is a wireless system that has the following capabilities:

**Immediate needs:**

   - Wireless entry sensors 
       - 4 door
       - at least 6 window sensors initially
       - motion sensors are probably not a good idea as I have a cat and a dog (both &lt;30 lbs), but I've had experience in the past with false alarms due to animals.
   - cellular dialing
   - INSTEON/X10/Zwave type connectivity 
   - 2 control panels, each capable of operation if the other is disabled.
   - Glass breakage sensors would be nice

**Future Needs (gradual upgrading):**

   - 10 window sensors
   - keychain remotes
   - internet/app access/control
   - INSTEON/X10/Zwave or similar devices such as lighting and thermostatic controls

I'm on the fence with monitoring.  I think I'd be okay with self-monitoring - having the system set up to call me/my cell, etc, in lieu of professional monitoring, but for the right options I'd consider a service.

Attach a sharp blade to something that's long, and bam, you have a spear.

At home you're mostly confined to relatively long, narrow corridors. The weakness of the spear (people dodging and attacking you from the side) is eliminated. Spears are already (IMO) the most fearsome and deadly weapon in the open (see video below). Indoors (long narrow spaces) they are by far the melee weapon of choice.

Most people are quite naive on spears, and grossly overestimate their reflexes whilst underestimating the opponent. If you don't have one - IMO, buy/make one!
