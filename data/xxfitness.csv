EDIT:

I did not expect this thread to blow up. In all seriousness. I will try to answer questions / address the haters. But to be honest the hate is only motivating to make even more progress because I did not intend to make the photos look enhanced in any way. They were purely for my own use and I wanted to try out the poses the fitness models use to compare my body to that physique. So I did, hence the tilting. 

The reality is that most ""fitspiration"" and ""hardbodies"" type photos are tilted, use special lighting, are posed etc. I decided to post my pictures because I learned and got most of my inspiration from other redditors, so I thought I should return the favor. 

I can't be bothered at the moment to take another photo, but in my first pictures my boyfriend took the photo for me and that angle is hard to replicate. Also, the lighting situation is hard to replicate because it is summer now and my apartment has weird lighting. So, here are three pics side by side from the same times, just different leg pose. I assure you I was not holding my ass up with my hands either... which hopefully the second photo proves. The third photo was intended to be a back photo, and I am not ""tilting"" my pelvis. The fourth photo was intended as a pose. 

[ A different rear view] (http://imgur.com/6GwfWvY)


So, to start out my routine was purely - **learn the lifts**. I learned the big powerlifts, squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press. I would do split workouts and focus on a muscle group each day. In the beginning leg days looked like this:


*Squats 3 x 5* 

*Single leg split-squats BW + 15 lb dumbbells 3 x 5* 

*Leg press 3 x 8*

*Romanian deadlifts 3 x 8*

*Back extensions BW + holding 25lb plate*

My current squat 1RM is **165lb**

I did this for about the first 5 months, and now I am doing a modified PHAT workout that focuses on power days and hypertrophy days.

My cardio is sprinting on the treadmill in intervals one-two times per week, but really I do not focus any energy on cardio only lifting. I also really increased my protein intake. Now it is between 80-125 g on workout days.  I found that the biggest change I had to make was not buying an ice cream or cheeseballs as a reward for workouts. I am still occasionally guilty of this. My diet only changed in that way, I did not cut fat or calories intentionally. I do not count them either because I never can keep on top of it. 

Feel free to ask anything else, I would not have posted if I thought I would not receive both compliment and criticism. ",,True,,t5_2ryzy,1370726638.0,,,True,t3_1fxai1,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1fxai1/dont_lift_heavy_they_said_youll_get_bulky_they/,

So I started weightlifting almost one year after my brother tragically passed away from a heart attack. He was 29 at the time, we are/were barely a year apart. It was the most life changing event, ever. He meant the entire world to me, he was a king amongst men. Valhalla has him now, and I know he has a chair waiting for me. But it was a jolt, a realization. Your health is not only meaningful to you, but other people. Your livelihood and health are not only detrimental to you, but the ones you love. It made me feel like I was being selfish because I saw how his death affected not only me, my family, but so many others. Love yourself and others. Become and stay healthy. Please.

 I will be very honest when I say, I have not lost much weight at all. MAYBE 10 pounds. My waist was 30-31 when I started, now its 24.5. I have lost about 7 inches off my hips and my ass looks pretty damn good. Because now I have one! I cut out dairy and gluten, which was way easier than I thought. I started eating way more protein and lifted as heavy as I could. I never ever ran before. My thought was, unless the cops were chasing I wasnt running. Last month I finished my first 5k ever under 30 minutes. Yeah....I didnt know squatting could help that. I plan on another 5k next month. I started cardio within the past two months, never did it prior

edit2:
I am currently fluctuating between 116 and 119, 5'4 and I am not a huge calorie tracker but I would say over 2000 on work out days with a 60/20/20 split C/P/F and about 1600 on non workout out days with a 20/40/40 split.

Edit3:

I am so sorry first off for all the edits. And thank you guys so much for all your amazing comments and wow. I think I just had a little break down at work. Yes, y'all made me cry. Good cry!!!! Also I do want to mention something that I think is REALLY REALLY SUPER IMPORTANT. I did make a switch to the lean gains diet, but modified it to fit me. But when I started working out, I felt super bloated, I felt fatter, and it was like my jeans because sausage casings for my thighs. I looked at my diet, my workouts, and just about gave up. I didnt like my clothes feeling tighter and the scale didnt more. 

It was muscle. It was the muscle forming under my fat, it made me feel gross. So for about 2/3 months I felt like I was in constant Stay-Puft Marshmallow mode. As if I was on my period. Push through it, I know it sucks and I've been there. BUT your muscle WILL start burning that fat. You can be sitting on your ass and be burning more fat that if you didnt have the muscle. Don't stop because ""its not working"". It took how many years for your ass to get that way in the first place? It sure as hell wont change over night. Don't expect it, don't believe gimmicks, your overweight coworker, your crazy aunt that buys all that infomercial shit, or anyone else that can't physically prove it. 

Oh dear...edit 4:

My work out:

I had a severe case of fuckarounditis for the first year after my brother passed. I aimlessly wandered in and out of yoga classes. I was directed to [/r/fitness](/r/fitness) from a friend where I aptley stumpled upon /u/super_luminal's post and amazing ass transformation gif. [This post was my starting point](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/ux3jo/if_you_like_the_before_pictures_better_thats_too/) Also the FAQ, seriously...bookmark it. It answered EVERY QUESTION I HAD. It was gold for me starting off when I found my self googling ""power cage"", ""how much does an olympic bar weigh"", ""why does the smith machine suck so bad"", ""what the fuck is a macro"". All that stuff is there, waiting for you to absorb. 

Mostly I went for the SS routine except OHP's because lord knows I couldnt get the bar more north than my sternum. Bench, deadlift, squats 3x a week and then mixed in Jamie Easons Live fit trainer on other days. Super basic and quick to do. Thats it folks! With a couple yoga classes a week to keep the doms at bay. :)",,False,,t5_2ryzy,1366349211.0,,,True,t3_1c47yg,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1c47yg/this_is_my_one_transformation_after_starting/,

She was a loud mouth, kinda chubby, very hipster-ish girl who loved to say edgy things just to make everyone else notice her. While we were eating dinner, we somehow got onto the topic of going to the gym. Now I outweigh her by a good 30 pounds and was talking about going to the gym, and she says something along the lines of ""I have no qualms about making fun of people who are fatter than me because I'm so fat."" I was furious but didn't want to say anything to start a fight, so I let it go. Later she said that she doens't run outside and doesn't think fat people should because it's visually offensive and that ""I'll just make fun of them if I see them in the gym or out of their house. Just keep it in your own place.""

I couldn't keep my mouth closed, I said, ""Actually, when I'm at the gym and I see really heavy people I think they're so much more admirable than the thinner people there because they had to fight through a lot of emotional and physical bullshit to get there. I was super fat when I started going to work out and I was terrified of people judging me, but then I just started thinking 'Fuck them.'"" It didn't start a fight luckily, but I think I put her in her fucking place a bit. 

I was pretty proud of myself so I just wanted to share my victory over my own feminine sense of ""oh no, I'll just let it go to not cause a ruckus"" and instead labia-ed up and called her out on her bullshit.

As we edge towards 22,000 readers, it is my absolute pleasure to announce that the much-anticipated XXFitness FAQ is now ready. It has been written largely by myself, along with contributions to content from mods /u/tasteofglycerine and /u/DawgVet, with very helpful feedback and modifications from regulars /u/swolesister, /u/lonewolfx77, /u/tanglisha and /u/ashleygee. The total word count was... 16,747 WORDS! 

**[CLICK HERE TO READ THE BRAND NEW FAQ!](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/wiki/faq)**

You may also notice that **we have a new sidebar**. This has been changed to link to some sections of the FAQ which I think will be popular (though this may change as time goes on), as well as include a list of our weekly posts, which leads me to my next point...

**We have a new weekly thread!!** Instead of posting progress pics throughout the week, you now have TWO opportunities to show off - you can either post your pic as a success in Feats of Thorsday, or in... **Sunderwear Day**: The clothing-optional Sunday thread for progress pics, comparison pics, show-off pics, bicep pics, whatever you like! *Please comment below if you feel this is a good/bad move so we can gauge community response to this*

**Huge thanks to the other mods, the users and contributors who have helped me in fulfilling a lot of my goals with this sub since I was added back in January.** 

Here's what we've added to this sub so far in 2013:

- ALL the weekly threads
- User flair
- Post flair (please use this more!)
- Regular checking of the modqueue so posts get approved faster and trolls get deleted/banned (You should've seen how backed up it was!)
- Quicklinks to lifting programmes
- The FAQ
- Bear-lifting and cat-lifting posters in the sidebar
- More use of Fitocracy including the member thread

With your help we can hopefully keep improving it. Please [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fxxfitness) if you have ideas for making this sub better, if you think you'd be an awesome mod yourself, or if you notice any worrying trends you think draw away from the goal of this subreddit.

Can't say I have much insight into your individual situation (wot with not being a skinny chick), but from what I hear, non-overweight people sometimes get flack for going to the gym.

Every little thing now amazes me. I have a very steep driveway and dragged the trash bin up, my fiance is amazed I'm not even breathing heavy! I can run, jump, do roller coasters, no more seat belt extenders.

I'm a gym rat now! I can lift with the boys, everyone there knows me. I can not only keep up in my boot camp but can be the last one standing! I'm floored. 

It's been a really, really long journey. I won't lie, after two decades of failed diets and finally the diagnosis that I was insulin resistant and had dangerously high blood pressure, I had a gastric bypass. It's the best thing I've ever done, because it gave me the tool to be able to take care of myself. After the first 30 or 40 came off, I was able to exercise without hurting myself.

I went from being able to do only water aerobics and 20 minutes on a recumbent bike to now, where every other day I do an hour long boot camp followed by strength training, then the other days HIIT sprints and my other strength splits. I've done 2 obstacle runs so far, and doing my first Tough Mudder in November. This from the girl who hid in gym class, and couldn't even run 1/8 a mile when I was 12.

I literally wear smaller pants now than I did in 6th grade. And I'm more fit than I was at 10! That completely boggles my mind.

I'm working on building strength and endurance, I love tabata and heavy lifts, and I'm just gonna keep on trucking.

So, I guess the point of this is.. ladies, you're never ""done."" Your future is not set in stone. Believe me, 10 years ago I never in a million years thought my life would be what it is now. I was sure I was doomed to an early grave, years of sadness, and that was just the way it was going to be. It wasn't overnight, and it's taken a TON of work, but things can change. Day by day.

Thanks for reading :)

Edit: Thank you so much for all the nice comments! It really means a lot to me. I'm not kidding when I say that for the majority of my life so far I didn't think I would make it to 45 without a heart attack, so to be 33 and where I am now feels like such an amazing opportunity. This morning I deadlifted 10 more pounds than the amount I've lost, and it just hit me that I used to carry that around all day.

1372954436.0,296,self.xxfitness,1hn1ox,Thoughts from a bikini competitor on the recent posts.,vancetomakeyoudance,336,40,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1hn1ox/thoughts_from_a_bikini_competitor_on_the_recent/,"Hi all. =) 

First let me start off by saying this is nothing more than me giving my experience, thoughts, ect as a bikini competitor/fitness model on the recent posts of BF discussion, leanness, fitspo, ect. I am more than happy to answer questions the best I can and just be honest with you all because I think it is important to hear from someone who actually does it. I feel like bodybuilders/fitness models/ whatever else get a really bad wrap around here. 

I started my journey of competing about a year ago (three years total of weightlifting under my belt now) I went to the Arnold Classic in Columbus, saw a competitor and thought well damn, I am about to turn 25 and I want to look the best I physically can and try this. 

[This](http://imgur.com/gp2gx) was me when I started. I weighed 138 lbs and was 28% BF. I lifted three times a week with complex movements and basically ate whatever I wanted. I hired a coach and started competing last October. Since then I have had been successful in my competing, have been published in a magazine, have been to Nationals, and have been in a posing DVD. 

[First show](http://imgur.com/D8VO3) 

[Back shot bc this is prob what has changed more than anything haha](http://imgur.com/nryPd)

[Second show]( http://imgur.com/kKFMa) 

[Offically a ninja](http://imgur.com/FsXDw)

I fell in love with competing. I enjoyed the entire process from getting tan, my hair done, to stage time, to the life long friends that you make during this, the fact that you learn a lot about yourself and your capabilities, to overcoming your mental barriers, and yes I loved the intense training. 

I took a short time off, and competed in the Arnold Classic this year.  This was a show that was a personal goal of mine bc it is where my journey began.

[Front](http://imgur.com/cRgiPe7)

[I am on the right end with the long blonde hair](http://imgur.com/1kJ7oSA)

Between those two times I was doing a ton less cardio, and eating a lot more. I was eating about 1700 cals going into my Arnold show and doing three days of 20 min of HIIT. Not awful. Tolerable. I never felt run down, exhausted, ect. 

Why was I able to do this? Because I lowered my set rate. I stayed 5-7 lbs within my stage weight and my body adapted to that. It became more efficient and I had a higher metabolic set rate. I decided to try my luck at Nationals. 

[Nationals](http://imgur.com/xkSZj2n) 

[Photoshoot from Nationals](http://instagram.com/p/a0ovguhdPb/) 

At Nationals I was around 10% BF. I still had my period, was still eating 1800 cals, and I won't lie I was doing more cardio about 45 min four times a ~~day~~week (oops typo). 20 min in the AM then 20 min disbursed through my lifting.   It was tolerable, I only felt exhausted when I was working hours back to back as an ICU RN until midnight. Other than that I felt good. 

After this I officially went into my off season. I am up 7 lbs from my stage weight of 121 lbs. I am doing NO cardio. And I am in the gym five times a week for about an hour. I am eating around 2600+ calories average daily, and I have no idea where my bf is nor do I care. haha 

**A few things that I would like to address**

* You can get lean safely, and in a healthy manner. Me along with any of my teammates are a prime example of that, http://swolesister.com/ &lt;-- along with my girl Swoley., and my best bud WBFF pro http://instagram.com/hylaconrad. 

* Staying stage lean is difficult, and not realistic. Everyone should go into an offseason to recovery, eat a little more, make improvements, and most importantly get your metabolic rate as high as you can for the next time you cut. So many people do not do this, and this is where you get into problems later on. (If you are up to date on Layne Norton's things) 

* Having a solid foundation of muscle and knowledge of lifting will help you more than anything. I see so many girls who start competing or wanting to get lean who really don't have any muscle. If you take a year and get a foundation of muscle before you attempt to start cutting you will better off. 

* You can live a normal life and still do this shit. Most people I know many things before a competitor. They are mothers, wives,  co workers, whatever. We make TIME because this is important to us. I went to parties, holidays, whatever. Did I drink? No. I was okay with that my personal goals were. Did I bring my food? Yes. The people who love you will not care. It is a matter of determining what is important to you at that time. 

* Consistency is the vital to any success weather you want to be lean, get strong, or whatever. If you don't stay consistent then you will not see changes.

* If our off season many of us do a combo of IIFYM and 'clean'(stupid word) eating. I eat ice cream, poptarts, whateva. It is about balance and moderation. 

* Slow and steady wins the race. Don't rush into all this. Slow steady gains, or loses in BF is the best. Take time to change your set point. Be patient. Trust the process. 

* EAT YOUR FOOD. PLEASE. I beg you. Eat. &lt;3 Your body will thank you.

* Most fitness inspiration things are taken when people have prepped. But a lot of times people will give the model 2 weeks and sometimes more in advance so they can prep for them. Which is why so many of us stay 5-10 lbs within stage weight. 


**Take away point tl;dr** It is possible to make major changes to your body. It is possible to do reach your goals, you don't have to starve or kill yourself with three and four a days (seriously if a coach tells you to do that or eat so freaking little RUN THE OTHER WAY PLEASE!!!) It is also possible to make this a lifestyle and enjoy LIVING at the same time. We are not all unhealthy, insane, or stupid in our training and dieting. There is a reason for off season  &lt;3! 

Has it all been worth it to me? yes, and I will continue doing it bc this is an easily adopted lifestyle if you maintain a proper balance with it all and do things slowly and in a healthy manner.

Yesterday I was shown a diet a girl was given by her trainer. Here it is: http://i.imgur.com/fzI2vIX.jpg

I was immediately shocked and afraid for this girl's well-being. At most this diet consists of around 1000 calories if the protein the girl eats is beef...but closer to around 800 calories if the protein is chicken or fish. The trainer has her on a 6 day split with cardio and strength training. **This is scary.** This girl is going to drive herself into the ground and destroy her body along the way. 

It got me thinking about you all, and I really hope none of you are doing this to yourselves or are being told by a trainer to do so. Please take care of yourselves. I pray every day for ladies new to strength training, competing, or just fitness that they realize that **a fitness journey is not a sprint, it's a long-distance race.**

I'm competing in an NPC Bikini competition in 13.5 weeks and my diet is NOWHERE NEAR this extreme. I am still eating about 1900 calories a day! You can follow my journey **on Instagram @ohilyssa** or here: //http://ilyssagetsfit.blogspot.com/

If any of you feel pressured into this type of diet, or do not know where to start...do not hesitate to contact me.

**EDIT: I obviously advised her against this. Where are the fats? Where are the necessary carbs? This is more than just ketosis... this is complete glycogen depletion with risk of heart failure if she continues. Be careful, ladies!**

I've been doing a modified Starting Strength for a little over a month now, and I've been making some fantastic gains, especially considering how weak I was when I started out. I'm working out at the local YMCA, where there are two squat racks and an interesting mix of people - from college guys to ex-cons. (Pretty much no other women, at least not in the free weights area, but that's kind of to be expected.) I've been going there consistently enough now that I know a lot of the regulars by name, and they know I'm serious about lifting heavy and improving.

This guy, though, was curling in the squat rack when I got done with my warmup for like 5 minutes. (The other squat rack was being used by a guy doing squats.) He finally noticed me standing by and walked off without reracking his weights.

And then later, as I was doing dumbbell shoulder presses, he kept looking over at me. I have just managed to move up to 20 lbs on my shoulder presses - I started out only being able to do 10 lbs, and now 15 is too easy, so I've moved up to 20, but it's taking a lot of effort to finish my 5 reps. Finally he motioned to me to take out my headphones. ""You're lifting too heavy,"" he says. ""I know grown men who only press 30 pounds. You're lifting 20. You should try 10.""

""10 is too easy. So is 15. That's why I'm doing 20,"" I say, not adding *not that I have to explain myself to you, buddy* to the end.

""How many reps are you getting?"" he asks.

""Five,"" I say, and he makes a face.

""I've never seen a girl be satisfied with just five reps. They usually do like 15 or 20.""

I'm pretty sure the bitchy look on my face was probably enough to express how I felt about this guy trying to tell me how I should be working out, but nevertheless I said, ""Listen, my purse weighs more than some of those weights. Lifting 5 or 10 pounds 20 times isn't going to do jack shit to make me stronger. Which is my goal."" And then I put my headphones in, and did another five reps of 20. It was a struggle, but I did it.

Firstly, you all should know that MUCH of how we feel, think, act, and eat on a daily basis is regulated and modulated by our hormones. There's a fantastic graphic on this page of the fluctuations of your hormones that you should spend a few minutes studying: [Educate yourself!](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Hormones_estradiol%2C_progesterone%2C_LH_and_FSH_during_menstrual_cycle.png)

* The first **2 weeks** of your cycle (starting with day one of your period) is dominated by **estrogen.** Estrogen can make you gregarious, outgoing, energized, enthusiastic. It *can* make some people a little too high-strung.

* Ovulation happens approximately 12-16 days before your period. (So if you're like me and have a 32-35 day cycle, this happens on day 20 or so.) Otherwise, just count backwards 2 weeks from your period.

* After ovulation, your hormones switch it up and **progesterone** takes over. Progesterone increases your GABA. So you're much more relaxed, clear headed, and instead of maniacally running around, you're prone to want to stay in. You feel pretty good about life. *Some* few people may get too demotivated and interpret this as depression. But I LOVE progesterone. I feel like the world is A-OK during this time.

**A DROP IN HORMONES IS WHAT BRINGS THE CRAY**

Now, around the time when your period actually starts, AND just after ovulation (mid-cycle) within a day, both of your hormones plummet before one or the other takes over. And it's the sudden drop in hormones that actually makes us feel the worst. Grumpy as hell for no reason? Something you loved one day looks terrible today? It's probably your hormones. All wound up- is it a high estrogen time? Chillaxing to the max- is progesterone in the house? Raging/ Crying/ the world SUCKS: have both of your major hormones left the building? See, you're not as crazy or unpredictable as you've maybe been thinking. You just didn't know that it was the lack of hormones that made you a little crazy.

**[HOW THIS AFFECTS YOUR DIET:](http://www.thevenusweek.com/about-venus-week/big-three-hormones/)**


* ESTROGEN
So, what you really need to know is this. When Estrogen predominates during the first 2 weeks of your cycle, you [EAT 15% LESS](http://www.bewellliving.com/hot_topics_hormonology.html) naturally. That's right! Not only are you outgoing and energized but your hunger goes down, you're more sensitive to insulin, and you automatically assume a diet that will make you lose almost pound a week. Awesome! 

VS.

* PROGESTERONE
When progesterone dominates, you may automatically eat ~15% more. You might even [binge eat.](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/contemporary-psychoanalysis-in-action/201302/why-do-i-get-so-hungry-right-my-period) Bummer! That's because your body thinks you might be pregnant so has you go ahead and start eating for two, just in case. Combine that with the urge to sit around in your PJs, and, well...here come the love handles!


So! Our lesson here is this. **Start your diet in the first two weeks of your period.** 

You'll not only be feeling energized to work out and motivated and sharp, you will already be less hungry so starting a diet will be a snap, not a chore! In fact, you hopefully will have some success and enough momentum to make it through the tougher (dieting-wise) two weeks later in the month. ALSO now that we are more self-aware of the fact that it's just those pesky hormones, it should be a lot easier to recognize when they are making you reach for the brownies and put the brakes on it. You can do it! You can work WITH your body to lose weight. I hope you guys enjoyed this and that it was clear enough and had enough references. I'm pooped from the gym but can add more later if you want. &lt;3 xoxoxo!

Edit: this is 100% OC, but I forgot to tag the post, sorry!

Second Edit: Get the iphone/ ipad app **[""Period Horoscope""](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mood-horoscope-period-tracker/id498355157?mt=8).** Enter the first day of your period. It's awesome and will tell you where you are in your period. I used it and found out I have a really long cycle (32-36 days). Just reset it when you get your next period.

Push his [Dodge Charger](http://buriendodge.com/) 200 meters.  I took on that challenge on Tuesday.

The first 100 meters wasn't too bad as the road was very flat.  I was able to hold onto the bumper with my hands and push with my feet.  I ran at some points, and walked most of it.  The second half was a lot harder as the road has a slight incline.  At that point I had to turn around with my butt up against the bumper and push with my legs/quads.  At some points I put the bumper under my bent thigh and straightened my leg to push.  I thought I was going to die in those last 100 meters, especially the last 50.  If I stopped, the car would roll back on me, so I just kept pushing and pushing.  

I got odd stares from his neighbours (his gym is in his house), and someone stopped to see if the car had broken down.  This made me laugh because my trainer is a very buff guy who was sitting inside the car cheering me on, and playing Eye of the Tiger for encouragement.  Imagine if the car HAD broken down and he was inside the car making ME push it?  That made me laugh.  They were set straight, I was working out.

Out of the 4 clients who had taken on the challenge (it was told to us last week, so at that time only 3 others before me had attempted it, all female) I was the only one to make it to the finish line!!  I couldn't believe it!  Out of those other clients I've been with him the least amount of time, 10 months.  Some of the others have been with him for years!  

Today my mother, who also has him as a trainer, told me the two male clients who took on the challenge the next day finished it, but couldn't continue with their workouts afterwards like I did (I still had 40 minutes of my regular weight lifting to do)!  One left almost immediately afterwards, the other collapsed at the end, waited 20 minutes, then decided he couldn't continue with his session!

I lost 50 lbs in 2008 - 2009, but was still in the 200s.  My weight fluctuated between 208 - 235 over the next few years.  In April 2012 I was 225 lbs, single, unhappy, and ready to shed pounds....again.  

This time it worked!  I found a great diet that worked for me, found a personal trainer, and have slowly become fitter, healthier, leaner.  I'm not at my goal weight of 120 lbs just yet, I'm sitting at around 149 lbs, but I feel fantastic!  My cardio health has greatly improved, my cholesterol is at an amazing level, I'm no longer borderline diabetic, I'm also no longer single, and things are finally going my way!

At 36 years of age, and having dehydrated my body with excess amounts of diet colas, my skin isn't has elastic as it used to be.  Luckily I learned that in Canada, if you lose 100 lbs, medicare will pay for excess skin removal.  Come on 25 more lbs!  I have loose skin on my stomach, under my arms, all over my thighs, and....embarrassing as it is to admit...on my ""lady parts"".

The warm up includes 3 sets of jumping jacks, and you have to do them FAST.  Okay, I enjoy jumping jacks, no problem.  I couldn't do 10 jumping jacks even with a gun to my head 75 lbs ago, so being able to do them as fast as I can for a minute straight and 3 times at that is quite rewarding...except...

Okay, no problem, no one's around, just slap away.  THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING!  Mental note, DO NOT do jumping jacks in public with others around.  Will anyone know that sound is coming from me?

1376277684.0,193,self.xxfitness,1k6mvt,There is no correct way to grieve. There is no correct way to mourn. And so I ran.,darkhotaru,236,43,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1k6mvt/there_is_no_correct_way_to_grieve_there_is_no/,"My father-in-law passed away yesterday from a heart attack brought on by years of obesity, poor health/eating habits, etc. He lived across the country, and it was only a few weeks ago that we last saw him for my sister-in-law's wedding. Seven months ago he even flew out to see my husband and me get married. Add to the fact that he is extremely overweight and can not walk very far, it was so admirable that he was able to see both of his children married within a year of one another. It was an exhausting year, but he was strong, and we thought that he could make it.

My father-in-law suffered from obesity and poor health all his life, and had just recently switched to a paleo diet to get on track. He called a few days ago, extremely excited to tell me that he bought a gym pass and was going swimming the very next day (after years of inactivity). He was finally getting on the right track to fitness and good health! 

Yesterday morning we received a call from my mother-in-law, informing us that he had gone into cardiac arrest only a few hours ago and was unable to be resuscitated. He was gone. I loved him. 

His eagerness to be fit and healthy, ironically, killed him.

For some reason I took this news harder than my husband. I cried and cried. And then I was empty. I couldn't understand that someone I loved so much could die that way--trying so hard to be better. 

I don't know how to mourn. I still don't even know how to mourn the death of my own father 20 years later. I'm bad at facing emotions.

And so I run.

And I ran.

I ran for miles and miles the day of my father-in-law's death. I ran because I have the ability to be strong and healthy, I ran because I wanted him to come back so I could help him. I ran because I wanted to prove that I could beat death--be immortal. I was at the gym and I didn't care that I was pouring tears the whole ten+ miles that I ran. 

I cried because I loved my father-in-law, and it was so incredibly tragic that he died doing the very thing that he thought could help him. He died trying to be better.

I run for those who can't. I run because I can't face life without the strength that I know is inside of me--I am everything that I make myself out to be. 

I lifted heavier than I thought possible. I couldn't believe the strength that was emanating out of my body--the power that I never thought possible. I mourned through physical exhaustion. I mourned by completely obliterating my body until my mind was numb to mental clutter.

I run. 

I will always run. 

Edit: Thanks for the love and support girls/guys; this is why our subreddit thrives. We truly love each other. I think it's easy to get caught up in the overwhelming thought process of bulking/cutting, gains, squats, PRs--but in all honesty, I believe that stepping back and realizing how far each and every one of else has come since the beginning is miraculous.

1372075018.0,190,self.xxfitness,1gype9,[CONVERSATION] My top 10 beginners' tips for making healthier eating choices!,DugongOfJustice,224,34,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1gype9/conversation_my_top_10_beginners_tips_for_making/,"##What are some of your tips? Add them in the comments!

I'm going to link to this post from the sidebar as well! Don't forget that *simply being aware of what you are putting in your mouth is the first and most important step* regardless of your goals. 

**1. Remove the crap from your kitchen:** You know what I mean. Try to remove crisps, chocolate, softdrink, etc. from your kitchen and do NOT buy it at the supermarket. If you're in a situation where you can't chuck stuff out (e.g. living with people who aren't changing their lifestyle) then try tip 2...

**2. Hide any tempting snacks out of sight:** When snacks are visible you are so, so much more likely to eat them. It's a psychological fact. Hide the unhealthy choices at the back of the pantry and make them tough to get to.

**3. Use a shopping list and eat before grocery shopping:** Supermarkets and stores are quite literally designed to make you buy more. Ever noticed the chocolates near the checkouts? It's not an accident - my first job was as a checkout chick and our management called it the ""Impulse Bar"". Use a shopping list and stick to it to the letter. Eating a meal before you go will also reduce impulse buying!

**4. Prepare meals in bulk:** Not only are homecooked meals less likely to contain a whole range of chemicals and preservatives, but they also mean you save money and time, and you have all the control over what goes into them. Great meals for reheating include soups, stews, curry, stir-fry and sauces. If you like salads, why not prepare some diced beef or chicken with a sauce of your choice (e.g. Teriyaki chicken) to reheat and pour over fresh-bought veges throughout the week? It gives you a hot salad that will hit the spot and be much more beneficial than pairing them with rice. 

**5. Prepare healthy snacks in advance - make them visible and easy:** You can also pre-prepare snacks by buying a large packet of nuts, some mini-protein bars, and some canned fish/chicken/turkey - bulk buying these with some large sandwich bags means you can pack snacks for yourself in advance. Put the little bags in the fruit bowl or on the counter in an easy-to-grab location and keep one in your handbag for when you get a craving - you'll know you have an easy, convenient, and healthy option close by!

**6. Use smaller plates and dishes to control portion size:**  Here's an experiment for you... Get two bananas, put one on a small plate and put the other on a large plate. No matter how close to identical those two bananas are, your brain will tell you that the small plate has a bigger banana on it, and it will communicate that info to your stomach. This is a simple and terrific way of improving portion control.

**7. Use your calorie tracker as a meal planner:** If you don't have time/patience to enter your meals after you eat each mouthful, then take 5 minutes in the morning on the bus/train or at your desk to enter what you *think* you will eat that day. This will let you know if you need to cut back on any snacks you realise you can't afford, and also allow you to keep your meal plan in mind as you move through the day. It also lets you know when you have calories left over with which to enjoy a little bit more of something you love!

**8. Start tracking at your biggest meal of the day:** Although it takes some fiddling, you can change meal names on most calorie trackers. Make your first meal 'Dinner' if that's your largest meal, and track from 5pm to 5pm instead of midnight to midnight. This way, if you go overboard on dinner, you can dial back your breakfast and lunch the next day to compensate, since that will likely be more comfortable for you than scaling back dinner.

**9. Make one change at a time:** It can be tempting to turn around one day and think ""Right! I suck at this eating business - I'm going to eat salads for every meal and only drink water and track everything and it'll be wonderful!"". Bzzzzzt - wrong! This so rarely works, and is a recipe for disaster and feelings of disappointment in yourself when you fail. There are very, very few people in this world who can change everything at once (I'm not one of them!) that I always recommend trying to make one change (e.g. cut down to one can of soft drink a day) then *when you can maintain that change for a month*, moving onto the next goal. It's slow, but it will be effective. Other steps you can take (one by one!) to clean up your diet and/or portion sizes include: 

- add another serving of veges to whatever you eat now
- cutting down your 'empty' carb servings
- cutting down on alcohol intake
- drinking more water (instead of soft drink, fruit juice, etc.)
- drink green tea instead of milky/sugary coffee drinks
- track your protein intake and aim for at least 0.8x your body weight in lbs
- try to keep your sugar intake under 50g per day
- serve your meat with extra veges instead of rice/bread/pasta
- replace rice with cauliflower rice (grated cauliflower fried in a pan with some oil/onion)
- replace pasta with spaghetti squash
- reduce the amount of butter, mayonnaise and cheese on sandwiches or burgers
- substitute unhealthy snacks with protein bars, nuts, tuna, etc.

**10. Use the 90/10 or 80/20 guideline - also known as ""Don't sweat the small stuff!"":** The 90/10 guideline is basically that you eat good stuff for 90% of your calories, but 10% is whatever you want... even if it's just pure lard or beer or whatever your guilty vice of choice happens to be. If you're following a diet, it will be very very unlikely that you can stick to it 100% because we're all human and so many opportunities come up in day-to-day life to try to lead us astray from all the healthy options. Enjoy a little snack each day, or save up your 10% to have one or two meals each week which don't fit into your eating plan. Enjoy life and don't be disappointed if you have a crap day! 

##Health is a journey, not a race - so just make the healthiest choices you can, when you can, and don't beat yourself up when it's not quite working!

On a personal note: I've had mini holidays where I've eaten double my caloric needs for almost a week and gotten totally carried away. I enjoyed it, had fun on my holiday, and then came home and started cooking up my stir fry. 

Just do what you can - *every little change and every little healthy decision is an improvement on doing nothing at all* :-) You're heading in the right direction and we're here for you when/if you fuck up and fall off the bandwagon. HUGS WILL BE FORTHCOMING!

You saw me, my grandma, and my boyfriend riding our bikes today. You saw that I was overweight. You thought it would be funny if you and your friend yelled at us out the window a negative comment. I didn't hear exactly what was screamed, but I knew it wasn't positive because of your rude and condescending tone. Maybe I heard you wrong? No, because when I made eye contact with your pretty eyes and saw your perfect blonde hair, all I saw was the look of a smug bitch. You were judging me and my family, and I resent you for that.

Instead of cheering and smiling, you looked down upon me for trying to better my health with people I love. You never could have known that people like you are the exact reason why I avoided the gym and exercising in public like the plague. You never could have known that the first time my boyfriend and I went to the gym, I cried because the number of cars in the parking lot to me meant the number of people who will make fun of me. You will probably never know that comments like that stop people from trying to better themselves.

But you know what? Your comment didn't hurt me. Not like it would have a few months ago. I've lost 30 lb since the beginning of the summer, and it was thanks to the amazing support network I have to cheer me on and love me every step of the way. 

You know what else? Through exercise and eating right I will continue to loose weight and become beautiful with a loving personality. I feel bad that all you have is a pretty face, because no gym exercise or diet will make you any less of a horribly judgmental person.

Sincerely,

The girl you judged on her bike ride

But the victory here lies with a cookie. I work at a gym and take care of children while their parents work out. As such, I spend a lot of time with children, and then immediately leave to go work out. On Monday night, a little girl gave me a heart shaped cookie. My last day is Saturday, and she wanted to give me a little prize.

Before I started getting healthy, I would eat the cookie in a heartbeat. I would probably eat the cookie, then go get a milkshake and eat a burger. Since I've started trying to live a healthy life, I eat less, but I also control my food a little too much. I've put a lot of the food I love into the ""bad"" category.

Getting this cookie from the little girl gave me a bit of perspective. I don't need to eat this cookie and a dozen more, but absolutely refusing to eat a gift from a sweet three year old is also not quite right.

Suffice it to say that these three drunken frat boys followed me home, talking loudly about how badly they wanted to just gangbang a random girl and laughing with each other. Even when I managed to get in my apartment they stayed outside, shouting and banging at my door.

I've been sexually assaulted multiple times before, so I've developed a series of plans to defend myself and identify potential attackers. Except for some reason I never genuinely prepared for the possibility of multiple men, right at my apartment door, where I couldn't feasibly turn on my phone's voice record or anything of the sort without being noticed.

The past few weeks I've been browsing this subreddit for hours and hitting the gym, lifting heavy and astonishing myself with my strength. I wanted to grow strong for health reasons and because I didn't want to be that stereotypically physically inept female.

Because of xxfitness tonight I felt like I had enough strength and endurance to at least run away. Before I would have been frozen and incredibly helpless. I was obviously still not going to engage, but I was not frozen with fear that I couldn't defend myself in any way, shape, or form.

I know a lot of you girls on here want to be thinner, or be more fit aesthetically. Which is great, of course - that was part of the reason I started too. But I've realized that as women we've got our own set of problems with tackling this world. Being physically fit in the way you choose can help you get out of these unfortunate situations - or at the very least, give you enough faith in yourself to not be absolutely dead with fear.

I've not made mindblowing fitness progress but I've learnt to love being active and eating well, in a sustainable way for me.

My standard routine is simple, cycle is my main mode of transport and I cover around 6 miles a day. I go to a couple of yoga classes a week (I like Ashtanga) and I lift SL 5X5 3 times a week with added chin ups, pull ups and phrakture's Starting Stretching routine.

I'm currently cooking up giant batches of recipes from the Hairy Dieter's cookbook and having a lunch and dinner portion a day (currently on minestrone for lunch and jambalaya for dinner!), with oatmeal/milk/banana and coffee for breakfast and fruit and yoghurt for snacks.

About those stretch marks: I have done nothing special to get rid of them, time makes them fade and I barely think about them any more. Learn to love the tiger stripes and there's no need to worry about them anyway!

Perhaps the guys who go to my gym are just gentlemen or maybe it's because I work out in the morning with all of the old fogies (my boyfriend seems to think its because I have an excellent bitchface) but I have never been bugged at the gym. The only person who has ever corrected my form was my former PT and I have never been hit on. 

Well, there was this guy who threw his back out doing bicep curls when he realized I was lifting more than him-- but I'm pretty sure he was doing it to impress my (rather intimidating looking) boyfriend, not me.

I'm 43 years old, 5'6"" and weighed 256 lbs. back then.  I started with some cardio and dumbbells at first, then in September I started Jamie Eason's LiveFit (also from home so I had to modify some stuff) and made it six weeks with that before the time commitment became too much for me.

In November, I joined a gym.  I met with a trainer who set me up on a 3x6 program 3 days a week, which I've done religiously except for the 2 weeks over the holiday that the gym was closed.  As a result, I'm 60 lbs lighter than when I started and a buttload more confident and strong.

Tonight I had my first real gym victory.

There's another woman who works out when I'm there. She's very fit and does a lot of stuff that I hope someday to be able to do myself... pull ups, unassisted dips on the machine, hanging leg raises and jump squats on a bench. She's become a fitness role model in a way.

So tonight we ended up chatting a little and I said ""Not to sound weird, but I've watched you work out and it's so impressive. I really hope to be where you are someday."" She looked at me like I was nuts and said ""Seriously? Because I see you on the big bar every time you're in here and that to me is impressive. I stay away from that unless I'm supervised."" It shocked me to learn that someone I was semi in awe of was also impressed by what she saw me doing... me, who just six months ago couldn't walk across campus without breathing hard.

What an amazing feeling!  To anyone considering a strength training program, do it.  You won't be sorry.

I honestly didn't have much of an appetite after the breakup, but I made what I ate count (healthy). Once I regained my appetite, I started counting calories using MFP, and once my ankle (that I'd sprained right before the breakup) felt healed up I started doing C25k again, 2 weeks ago. I'm pretty active, as I work a very busy retail job. I never stand still or sit down for 8 hours, and then I walk to and from work (about 45-ish minutes total). 

Currently I'm still doing my C25k, but instead of just counting calories, I'm also trying to eat pure foods. I'm mostly eating raw, right now. I'm also trying to decide between yoga or sit-ups/crunches on my off days. Input?

A typical non-rest day:

**Breakfast**:

* 1 glass orange juice &amp; toast with avocado **or** 

* 1/2 cup 0% Greek yogurt with 1/4 tsp all natural raw whipped honey **or**

* 1/2 cup Vitamin D milk (haven't gone pure on that yet) with one of four whole grain all natural cereals in my cupboard

Work for 8 hours, standing/running/walking entire time except during 30m 

**Lunch**:

* Sandwich on nuts and seeds bread with 1T hummus, 1/4c radishes, 1/4 sunflower sprouts, 1/4c orange bell pepper, 1/4c spinach, and 1 1/4"" slice of heirloom tomato (all the above is organic and locally grown) **and**

* A piece of fruit from a produce stand near work **and**

* 1/2c whole sugar peas (hull and all) **or**

* 8oz chilled gazpacho soup with a little olive oil

**Exercise**: 

* warm up stretch for 30m

* run/walk in intervals according to C25k program; usually get about 2.5 miles in 30m

**Dinner**:

* More yogurt, cereal, or a sandwich. 

* Sometimes I'll fry up some tofu in a little olive oil with cooked spinach and an egg, but it's been really hot lately and I've been actively avoiding turning on the oven.

**And y'all, I look and feel fuckin' fantastic. The best revenge is living well, right ladies?**

I'd love critique. My diet isn't that great; I totally know that. I definitely need more protein. Also just any suggestions in general would rock, especially as far as the feasibility of my goals. I don't have a gym membership and have no money to get one, so keep that in mind.

**My goals:**

* I want to run a 5k by September (when our wedding was supposed to be), 10k by December, 15k by February, and a half marathon by April (our anniversary). 

* I want to get to 175lbs (my weight when I started college) by September, 150 by December (regardless of whether I've met my September goal), 150 by February, and 130 by April (100lbs down total!)

* Once I start school in September I'll have gym access and will start weight training; I'll worry about creating goals for that when I find out what I can do. For now: a fun thing I've been doing is making extra effort to lift heavy things at work, like 25lb truckles of cheese. [Progress](http://i.imgur.com/UK7FMgg.jpg)?

**TL;DR**: from May 9th 2013 - July 7th 2013, I've lost 27lbs (which puts me at the lightest I've been in 2.5 years), gone down a pant size, down two band sizes in my bra, and can now run/walk 2.5mi without issue.

Please welcome /u/lonewolfx77 as a new /r/xxfitness mod! She's shown some terrific initiative here and given great advice and support to our users.

After our thread yesterday, waiting for 24 hours to pass and then tallying the votes, the results are in! /r/XXFitness will be moving to text-only format. This basically means that **anyone can post progress pics/updates, however they must link to those pics from within a text post giving more details (e.g. the programme they're doing, their stats, any nutritional info, etc.)**. 

Posts which simply post a link to pics with no information about their fitness journey will be removed by the mods, redirected to post in the **now-renamed SNAPSHOT SUNDAY** threads (kudos to /u/this_racoon for the name!) and also directed to /r/progresspics if they can't wait. Or they can simply edit their post to include more details and have it approved that way :-)

For those who are worried that this will jeopardise the sub, or in some way diminish the great atmosphere we have here, this is the same policy that is used by a lot of the fitness/nutrition subs, including (but not limited to):

- /r/fitness
- /r/keto
- /r/loseit
- /r/gainit
- /r/bodyweightfitness

Speaking of /r/keto: We're nicking their terrific sidebar linking/post tagging system - since it's awesome, basically. **So please do add square-bracket tags when posting from now on.**

We will also be adding a line into the sub's description in the sidebar clarifying this stance, and also to **request that users keep disparaging comments about their bodies to a minimum**. It is one thing to say ""I've been working really hard on my [insert area here]"", it's another to say ""I just hate how gross my [insert area here] looks"". This is not only because we want to keep this place positive, but also because comments like those can be very triggering for other women, and we can't ignore the difficulties many women in our midst face with battling disordered eating.

The truth is most of you probably won't notice the change - but hopefully this will help keep this community on track as a place for a focus on fitness, rather than thinness, and a place for discussion/assistance/debate, rather than a body gallery. Though on that note, if you do want to see real women's bodies at different heights/weights/sizes/etc then feel free to visit http://www.mybodygallery.com, or keep an eye on our Snapshot Sunday threads! 

**Thank you everyone for your feedback yesterday. I know that not everyone will be happy with this change, but I hope that you continue to stay involved and look at the (hopefully more detailed) progress posts that arise now.**",,False,,t5_2ryzy,1371092675.0,,bear-lifting,True,t3_1g8fsf,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1g8fsf/mod_post_rxxfitness_will_now_be_text_only/,moderator

Today, I lifted that girl up. I walked into the squat rack with my new weight and muscles, and did working sets at 115lb. I put her on my shoulders and squatted her, and in some ways, I think it helped me move on from that. I'm at 130 now, working my way up based on strength goals (1x bw squat, 1.25xbw deadlift, 0.75xbw bench) and not by the number on the scale.

Previously she's been doing her gym's Silver Sneakers class, but my mother had been telling her about my progress with weight lifting and weight loss and she wanted to see what I was doing. 

It was such a blast! We went very light since neither of them has ever lifted a weight more than 5 lbs. in their life. We went over dumbbell basics and the different cable machines. My grandmother liked the cable row, she said it was her new favorite. :)

Afterwards since they'd asked, I showed them my deadlift (Not a move I tried to teach them), and their faces when I lifted 160 lbs. were pretty priceless. 

My mother had been skeptical about this from the beginning. She was raised to believe that women weren't meant to lift heavy weights and should just stick to cardio. This was my one chance to show her how good it could feel to lift (relatively) heavy things and how strong it can make you feel. 

I guess I was at least somewhat successful, because we're scheduled to go again next Sunday, and since we spent this time going all over the gym just learning about different moves, my mother wants me to give her a simple routine to do!

Here was the initial progress pic, Dec 2009/February 2012: [2] http://i.imgur.com/Vtc4h.png 

Updated photo! Left: Dec 2009 Right: Sept 2012 [3] http://imgur.com/kVzRY 

6 months ago I was 132 lbs and a size medium. I am now 133lbs and a size small.

Lifts that I have recorded so far:

    1RM Dead Lift: 180#
    2RM Front Squat: 125#
    2RM Back Squat: 120#
    2RM Push Press: 80#
    1RM Squat Snatch (most frustrating movement): 70#
    3RM Bench Press: 95 lbs

I find it odd my FS is heavier than my BS, but that might have just been a bad BS day, but it is my PR, nonetheless.

To give an example of progression, in January 2012 my 1RM Front Squat was 105#. 105# is now my 5RM as of September 14, with my 2RM being 125#. It should be noted that I do Crossfit and incorporate extra days of pure strength, so my progress may not be the most rapid, and I am okay with that.

Below are some more photos, all taken within the past month/2 months, my diet, workout regimen, and a little happy/sad story:

Obligatory gun show shot: [6] http://imgur.com/LFI9F 

And, my ass. [7] http://imgur.com/rpELZ  I don't even care if this appears to be vain, I wanted a nice ass. All ladies want a nice ass. Do you know how I got this ass? I squatted heavy weights. Back squats, front squats, squat cleans, squat snatches, and air squats. Squats. Squats. Squats. It might not be the prime pick of the crop in terms of asses, because, well, I'm white...not Brazilian. But it's a vast difference from where I was not even 6 months ago.

So what did I do to get to where I am now? Well, I worked my fucking ass off, got into a healthy regimen and, most importantly, kept my diet clean. I cannot stress the importance of nutrition enough.

My diet, save for this months challenge (doing a Whole30 Challenge which is basically strict Paleo), is very clean. My kryptonites are craft beer, wings, and dark chocolate. Personally, I am miserable with restriction. I allow myself some treats here and there because it makes me happy. I don't gorge on food - I savor it. That understanding, that relationship with food, took a long time to construct. If you're eating shit food and want to eat healthier, it's best to incorporate those changes slowly so that the replacement is long term rather than short term. It isn't a diet - it's a lifestyle change. Take a few things out per week and allow your body to acclimate to the healthier changes. When grocery shopping, stick to the perimeters of the store. Buy whole, fresh food and cook it yourself with spices that don't contain chemicals or sugars. I eat about 90% Paleo.

From the point that I made that post 6 months ago I ended up getting my heart broken to pieces, moving, and taking a 2 month hiatus from Crossfit for financial reasons (due to moving). From April to about August I was attending Crossfit about 3, maybe 4x a week. I stepped it up a notch in August and have been going 3-5 days a week. My box also offers pure strength training classes in the mornings which I have been attending as well. Lifting weights is the best thing to happen to me in a long time, maybe even my entire life!

And last, but not least, the ""little black dress"" pic. [8] http://imgur.com/CEgM0  There's a sad/happy story to this one. I had a little black dress I had purchased in the summer of 2011 to wear for a birthday celebration. I was excited to look cute for the guy I was dating. Unfortunately, he was going away for a car show and I ended up not going out for my birthday, never wearing the dress. To make a long story short, he was actually with another girl at that car show, a girl he was sleeping with for a large quantity of the time that I was with him, even sleeping with her the same day he spent time with me. I found out, he confessed, and we were over. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't heartbroken. So, a month ago I decided I wanted to go out for my birthday and finally wear the dress. The problem was, it didn't fit me anymore...it was too big! So, I bought a smaller, little black dress :) The end.

Okay, If you got this far then I am extremely appreciative. It took me almost 2 hours to put together because I wanted to make sure I covered all of the bases. If anyone has any constructive criticism or suggestions, please let me know! The only issue I am having now is the stubborn layer of fat that just wants to hang around. I seemed to have plateaued. I am perfectly fine with the # on the scale, just would like that stubborn last bit of fat to go away because I have worked hard to build muscle and would like that to show. I will be upping my cardio in the meantime to see if that helps.

All in all, it took me about a year from April 2012 - April 2013. I've fallen off the wagon many times, especially in dieting and eating clean. I was lifting on a 3 day split, Chest/Tri, Legs and Back/Biceps. But later on i discovered SS and continued on from there.

It was pretty hard to gain while eating at a deficit, and progress was pretty slow. I'm still a work in progress, but i'm happy with this lifestyle. This post will be a reminder of how far I've come.

--------------------------

I think I've hit a bit of a plateau, so I'm hoping that looking at my progress so far will keep me motivated.  Truth be told, although the scale, measuring tape, and pictures show a difference... I don't feel different *at all*.  Perhaps I will once I get below 200 pounds.

I'm not entirely certain what it is that finally galvinized me to change.  I've always been ""big,"" both horizontally and vertically.  I'm the black sheep of my extended family, in that regard (well, horizontally.  A lot of my relatives are tall).  But I have never identified myself by my body; always with my brain, actions, and bank account.  So while I haven't been *happy* with my body, it hasn't particularly been a source of anguish.  I have successfully lost weight in the past; I got down to a healthy BMI for a while in high school, but the weight crept back on through the years.

I've heard that lifestyle changes are easier to make when they happen in conjunction with other large life changes.  So when I moved and switched jobs, it seemed like the logical turning point for my corporeal self.  Add on my frustration with clothes shopping (so difficult when you are big and tall and small boobed), and a comment from my boyfriend (that he loved me, but if I continued to be so overweight he wasn't sure how physically attracted he would be to me years from now), and possibly other forgotten factors, and the result is where I am now.

Here's the lifestyle changes I've made:

**August, 2012**

Got a job in the city, rather than the suburbs.  Started walking ~1.5 miles a day for public transportation.  Started eating ungodly amounts of unhealthy snacks, provided free at work.

**September**

Got a bike mid-September.  Immediately became a full-time bike commuter.  10 miles round trip, flat ground.

**October**

Stopped eating the free unhealthy snacks at work, cold turkey.  That was 400+ calories a day.  Started being more organized about bringing healthier lunches.

**November**

Woke up at 5:30am three days a week for a 5 week kettlebell class that I got off of groupon.  Loved it, but the full fee is out of my price range, and I was only able to motivate myself to wake up so early because I knew it was temporary.

**December**

Joined a gym near work.  Did unorganized, self directed exercise.  Also took a couple of ""cardio sculpt"" classes.  Went on vacation.

**January**

Started the program laid out in ""New Rules of Lifting for Women"".  

-----------------------

My current exercise schedule (beyond the 55+ miles a week I get from riding my bike *everywhere*) is:

**Monday**: Lift.

**Tuesday**: Cardio kickboxing.

**Wednesday**: Rest.

**Thursday**: Lift during lunch.  Yoga after work.

**Friday**: Rest.

**Saturday**: Lift.

**Sunday**: Rest.

--------------------------------

Like I said, I feel like I've hit a bit of a plateau; my weight has hovered in the 220's since Christmas.  Part of it is that I feel out of shape because I've been biking slowly recently.  I'm hoping it is the ""sub zero after windchill"" weather that is responsible.

My workout schedule is pretty intense right now, and I'm a bit afraid of burn out.  But it hasn't happened yet.  Other things are slipping a bit; my room is much more of a disaster than usual, and there's a Microsoft certification that I *really* need to get around to studying for (I want to get a bonus at work), but I'm often tired in the evening and that the last thing on my mind is cracking open a text book.

The classes can be split up by level (beginner, intermediate, or advanced), skill focus (flexibility, balance, strength, or combo), and by time (15 mins, 30 mins, or 60 mins). The instructor and background music are so soothing and relaxing I found myself actually ENJOYING the stretches and poses (normally I just get really bored). 

The other cool features of this app are the Pose Blocks where you can choose common pose sequences and even put them together to create your own classes! It also accesses your calendar to schedule a class at a certain time of day so you don't forget to do your yoga :)

I got into resistance training senior year of high school, but I'd do lots of reps with very little weight rather than actually focusing on strength. That phase lasted briefly and then I lapsed into cardio-only mode. I stayed there on the elliptical for 5 full years, eating 1200 calories a day, wondering why at 5' 5"" and 125 lbs, I didn't look the way I wanted to. I was working out 2-3 hours a day and eating nothing just to maintain a body I wasn't happy with. My immune system was shot, I was moody and sad and miserable and sick all the time.

Eventually, I stopped caring. I stopped working out 7 days a week and I stopped keeping track of what I ingested. I went from gymrat to couch potato. I let go of the idea of being perfect, and it made me so much happier. However, within those 2 years I managed to put on 25 lbs of pure chunk (bringing me to about 150) and lost any semblance of fitness that I once had. My body hatred started to creep back when I'd see myself in photos or I'd have to put on a pair of shorts that fit the year before. Unhappy with myself, I reverted back to my old ways. 1200 calories a day, 5 hour long spinning classes a week, 3 or hour long elliptical sessions a week. I lost weight (went from 150 to 132), but I felt like shit. I was afraid to go out to dinner with my boyfriend, I would cancel plans with friends so I could make a spinning class, etc. I was falling right back into my unhealthy patterns (not to say that working out a lot is unhealthy, but it was consuming my entire life on a way that made me, personally, miserable. I think that's a good place to draw the line between a healthy and unhealthy amount of working out, rather than focusing on time).

I don't know when it happened or what triggered it, but sometime about 3 months ago, I had the epiphany that fitness doesn't have to be an all or nothing phenomena. I let go of this preconceived notion that you're either fit or you're not and there's no in between. I let go of the idea that exercise is exclusively about aesthetics. I started strength training 2 days a week. Recently I've added in 30 minutes of cardio (C25K) 3 times a week. I've started tracking my calories again, but I've given myself much more leeway (1600 on normal days, 2000 on weight days) and don't beat myself up when I go 50-100 calories over.  I don't keep myself from going out with friends for fear of going over my calorie goals, I just don't go out every night.

And I've seen serious results. I didn't expect much from a 2 day a week routine, but I have lost 2 inches from my chest, 2 inches from my waist, **4** inches from my lower stomach/hip area, and 2 inches from my butt. Note I'm counting in inches, because I've actually gained 8 lbs. 

**TL; DR:** I'm gaining weight, but losing inches. I'm still tracking my calories, but I'm eating closer to maintenance level. I'm working out 5 days a week, but spending less time on sessions. I don't go out every night, but I have a social life.

I'm in my early teens (think *super* early) and I've always been 'the fat kid'. I was always told, ""Don't worry, you'll grow out of it one day. You'll lose your baby fat."" Ever since I heard those words, I was unmotivated to do *anything* about my generally unhealthy state. I was waiting for the day when BAM, no more blubber! Just sitting around. Eating to pass the time. Waiting.

Until one day last year I realized, Jesus Christ. I look and feel hideous. This isn't right. I need to do something about this before I enter high school. And so, I did.

I ran several miles a day under the friggin' hot southern sun, ALL SUMMER LONG. When I wasn't doing that, I was sweating my butt off under hot white lights, acting in an outdoor drama. I lost thirty pounds in three months. I'm trying to fix my broken self-esteem. I'm trying to improve myself more and more every day. I'm working really hard to be healthy and comfortable in my own skin, at the same time. 

But then people that I haven't seen in a couple of years will come up to me and say, ""Hey! I told you you'd lose your baby fat! You look good! Heheh, didn't I tell ya?""

And then I want to scream.

I was living an unhealthy lifestyle, and I worked (and I'm still working) my butt off to be healthy. I WORKED FOR THIS DUDE. IT WASN'T A MAGICAL TRANSFORMATION. IT WAS NOT BABY FAT. IT WASN'T GOING ANYWHERE. I HAD TO GET UP AND *MAKE* IT LEAVE. It wasn't because I got taller, it wasn't because I got curves, it wasn't because I'm 'maturing'. It's because I put forth effort.

And you know, even the term 'baby fat' REALLY makes me mad. Baby fat does not exist unless you are, in fact, an infant - because they usually actually DO grow into their flub and extra skin. Otherwise - you are *probably* over weight, and you should at least be moderately motivated to do something about it.

First off, I want to be really clear that this is not intended as an attack on any group or individual. I love this sub. It's the one Chrome fills in as soon as I type in ""r"" (my account is new but I've been around for a while under a different name). I've cheered out loud for everyone's Feats and bragged about my own. I hesitated about whether to post anything, but finally decided to go ahead because I respect the hell out of all of you and want to take this conversation out of my head &amp; onto the page. If you disagree with me, I would still love to hear your opinion. 


In brief, it seems to me that XX has started to reflect the larger trend of ""strong is the new skinny"" to a disturbing degree. Women who looked completely average and healthy - as far as health can be extrapolated from appearance - decry their ""skinny-fat"" ""before"" bodies, and I'm sitting here thinking, damn, what is she talking about? The new aesthetic of impeccable leanness seems as tyrannical as that of perfect thinness that we're so proud of rejecting. 


I worry that this trend could prompt vulnerable girls and women to see flaws where there is beauty, or to feel like they've failed or are not fit enough if they don't look like fitness models. Certainly, a leaner, more muscular-looking body *can* be a sign of improved health. But what starts as dedication too often turns to unhealthy preoccupation with appearance. I don't want any woman to feel that she needs to achieve that look, or *any* particular look, and many of the new posters here seem to feel that they should. Fitness, IMO, is mainly about long-term health, mental well-being, self-confidence, and many other non-aesthetic benefits. You do not have to look a certain way to be beautiful, healthy, and confident. 


**Tl;dr**You're awesome and sexy and fit and beautiful. 

I really want to hear what others have to say about this, so I'll shut up now.

They were all very muscular and had outrageous spray tans. After I explained the purpose of the crazy looking tan to some people in my group, one of my friends said something like, ""You know what I hate? Female body builders.""

Everyone in the group laughed, and I said something like, ""Oh, you hate ALL female body builders. Okay. They ARE bad people."" It was a joke to try to get him to make less of a generalization. He went on to say that he didn't think anyone looked good that muscular, and I said that's fine that he doesn't like that look. I don't particularly like it either.

But then he said he doesn't like it on women because it's taking something beautiful and feminine and making it unnatural. That kinda' made my blood boil just a bit. I'm really tired of people judging other people's body choices. If you're being healthy about it, and you're super skinny, kinda chubby, really athletic, or a mass of muscle, then you should be able to be that way without judgement from others. 

I just said, ""Just throwing this out there, but some women don't care about that stuff [being ""feminine""], and they should be able to be however they want to be."" Everyone went kind of quiet, and that topic of conversation ended there. I felt weird after the silence, but I stuck to my guns and didn't apologize for what I said. 

I don't want to be a body builder or compete in a figure competition, but I totally respect the women that do. It takes an incredible amount of dedication, self-control, and just plain hard work to even compete in those things. 

On a related note, I saw a woman at the gym today that had some really legit guns. Her biceps looked incredible, and she was wearing workout ""tights,"" so I could tell her legs were probably amazing, too. And, SHOCKER, she had marks of ""traditional femininity"": pretty big breasts, makeup on, and even a french tip manicure that looked flawless.

What do you guys say when people say things like that? Do you just ignore it now because you're tired of responding to it, or do you still speak up? I have thought about what I'll say if someone ever advises me to stop lifting weights because it's dangerous or it'll make me look like a dude. I'll just say, ""I've been doing it since last August, and all it's done is make me feel good about myself and made my pants fit better."" 

**EDIT:** Since this post has received a good bit of attention on this sub, I just want to clear some things up that people are asking about. 

I definitely was not upset that my friend was saying he personally didn't like how super muscular (think body building women on steroids, or even really really muscular natural body builders) look. I was actually trying to get him to phrase his idea as an opinion, which he did after my first comment. It was when he started saying women body builders pervert their ""natural forms"" that I felt the need to defend ladies with muscles.

My group did rag on the male body builders in the restaurant for a minute, but it was mostly about their unnatural looking tans, not how their bodies looked. Then the conversation quickly switched to how unnatural women body builders were. 

My friend does not hate women, and he is not a terrible person. He just has the tendency (as do most people) to generalize and phrase their opinions as fact. I wouldn't have even made this post if he'd said, ""In my personal opinion, women body builders are taking their bodies, which are already beautiful and feminine, and making them something masculine and unattractive to me.

I could probably do more but as Mehdi suggests I started with just the bar on all my lifts simply because I'm new to lifting and figured it would be a good way to practice form. So I started last week--it took all the confidence I could muster (as well as having a buddy elsewhere in the room) to go up to the squat rack and just... start. I'm sure many of you can sympathize with this barbell nervousness. Doesn't help that I have severe social anxiety. Anyways, I've stuck to it despite feeling a little nervous about the people around me every time. But yesterday for various reasons I ended up having to go to a different gym.... talk about leaving my comfort zone. I'm always intimidated by all the muscly lifting guys around me especially since I'm always the only girl in there. Anyways at this gym there was only one other dude in the freeweight room at the time, but it's close quarters and I still felt very intimidated by him... until I noticed he wasn't very muscly at all, and wasn't lifting very big plates, and seemed unsure of himself and his form and he also kept glancing over nervously at me in the mirrors as I did him, and wouldn't lift if I was facing him just like me... and I even noticed he was actually doing five sets of five on his lift! I think he was on the same week of stronglifts I am! Anyways I didn't say anything to him or anything since I would be MORTIFIED if anyone spoke to me in the weight room, but it was just funny that amid all my performance anxiety I noticed that the other dude wasn't much of a beefcake either. Definitely feeling more confident about the weight room going forward; it's not just for super beefy dudes, it's for people at all levels of training and any gender. Just thought I'd share!! Also while I'm at it, I'd love to hear from other gals on Stronglifts, your experiences with it, etc. I'm pretty sore, haha.

**A bit of background**: I have been competing in powerlifting since I was very young, but only competed in bench press (that is a whole 'nother story in its own). After taking fitness and lifting into my own hands, I began my squat and deadlift journey with much gusto.

However, when I got to heavier weights...Feeling that much weight on my shoulders (figuratively and literally), would always make me hesitate and doubt myself. This would cause me to either chicken out, or do a half squat (not go to parallel). And today was no different in terms of my confidence. I wasn't even planning on maxing today!! My boyfriend/lifting partner is gone for the weekend so he wasn't there with me, and my other lifting buddy had to bail. So it was just me, the bar, and a rather nice gym employee who rallied me on. 

**My training program** is just something my parents had me do when I was younger, and over the years, I changed a few things to better suit me. It's most similar to 5/3/1 though. My first two or three sets of lifting really determine what kind of lifting I'll be doing that day. If everything is feeling heavier than normal, I settle for doing low weight and high rep sets (sets of 10-15 reps). If I'm feeling good, or feeling particularly naughty, I'll do heavy sets of 3 or 5 (also dependent on how the heavier weight is feeling to me). Whether I'm doing a light day or heavy day, I always do two or three warm up sets.

How it normally goes though is this:

**Light Day**

+ Warm up: 45lbs (naked bar) x 10 reps (just to limber up)

+ Warm up: 95lbs x 10 reps

+ Working Sets (repeat 4-5 times): 135lbs x 12-15 reps or 145lbs x 12-15reps

+ Kill yo 'self: 95lbs x failure

**Heavy Day:**

+ Warm up: 45lbs x 10 (limberin' up yo)

+ Warm up: 115lbs x 5

+ Warm up: 145lbs x 5

+ Working Set (repeat 4-5 times): 165lbs x 5 **or** 185 x 3 (unfortunately I can only really achieve 185lbs x 3 when I have a spotter...confidence issues haha)

+ Kill yo 'self: 135lbs x 8-10

**Today** this is what I did:

+ 45lbs x 10, 115x10, 155x4, 185x1, 200x1, 145x8, 145x8, 145x8, 135x10

+ Leg press and calf raises on leg press between each squat set, except between 185lbs and 200lbs. **Leg Press:** 200x10, 200x10, 200x10, 250x8, 250x8, 250x8, 200x10 **Calf raises:** same as weights as leg press, except 10 reps for every set.

Typically, I also alternate seated leg curls and seated leg extensions after I'm done squatting. But I got to the gym late and they were closing. :(

ANYWAY, I'm super stoked for myself and am now going to go stretch out my hip flexors because *god damn* they be tight now.

**TL;DR:** I squatted 200lbs at 134lb body weight, yo!

**EDIT:** Went and got a congratulatory beer with my gal pal. It felt so right. The beer...and me...but then I had to finish it. So depressing. Anyway, good night everyone. Hope to talk to you peeps later :D

Before I started working out, I was at my heaviest at 5'4"", 160lbs in 2011. At the tender age of 21, I had high cholesterol and was also in danger of developing diabetes, thanks to a combo of family historyand my horrible lifestyle (fried everything + sedentary student life + desk job).  

**The transformation from couch potato to athlete!**

I've been working out pretty consistently since Dec. of 2011, starting with a scaled down version of Starting Strength in Dec 2011 (lifting 2x a week) and switching over to CrossFit in Dec 2012 (3x a week).

In February of this year, something clicked and I became a fitness maniac, going to workouts 5x a week and pushing myself harder than I ever had before, and my results in the past 2 months have been far more impressive than anything I had accomplished before.

I mean, just the other week I ran 2.5 mi without stopping (after swearing off running forever in high school, ha) *and* I did a 100lb clean and jerk! I also started out doing SS with only a bare bar back squat, and now I'm doing a 135lb front squat!

Sure, I'm still no [Christmas Abbott](http://myathleticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Christmas-Abbott.jpg), but I'm sure as hell working on it. Hell, maybe next year I could even compete in some local weight lifting and CrossFit competitions! :D 

As a side note, I haven't been working on my aesthetics, so I've only lost 7 lbs so far, but I look and feel 100 times better, so I can't complain. My formerly tight skinny jeans are pretty baggy in the waist and legs now, so I have a feeling my actual fat loss has been a lot more than just 7 lbs.

**Dat NSV**

Anywho, yesterday I tried out my boyfriend's [""pulse oximeter""](http://www.clinicalguard.com/images/UserFiles/products/d_products/oximeter_finger.jpg), which tests for blood oxygen saturation and resting heart rate. 

It turns out that I now have a ~54 bpm and a blood oxygen saturation of 99%, which [gives me a female athlete's resting heart rate!](http://www.topendsports.com/testing/heart-rate-resting-chart.htm) Say waaaattt? 

I wish I knew what it was before I started working out, but just walking up hills used to wind me and make me sweat, so I imagine it was horribly high.

He turned 13 two weeks ago and so can go with me to the gym now. So far I was just letting him noodle around on the treadmill, but today, oh my dear ladies, TODAY  I began teaching him proper form for a deadlift.

Yeah he was embarrassed, and yeah a couple guys next to us were laughing, but we pushed through and by the time we were done he could pull the bar with an over-under grip, from just below his knees on the rack, properly. The rounded back and knock knees were gone and in their place was the sweet, sweet beginnings of his potential form.

I *know* he has no idea how much me teaching him proper form is gonna matter to him when he is *dominating* the weight room in highschool, but *I* know. This kid is gonna be pulling monster weight, that's just his personality. He's too big to be super fast, but he'll be big and hard, not big and soft. Mom's gonna make sure of it!

I'm not gonna push him, just keep taking him when its empty and working on deads till he's confident and his form is in place, then we'll move on to a new movement. i plan to keep layering like that one thing at a time.

I thought I'd pass this along since I've been doing it to my old t-shirts for quite some time. It's a great way to reuse shirts that you don't wear much any more or have pit stains etc. 

Couple of notes -

 I don't have a sewing machine, so I've just always used a narrow strip of the fabric and tied it around the back, knotting tightly each time (maybe four knots total - two front and two back, and just to be clear by ""knot"" I mean the crossover you do first to tie your shoes) and it seems to hold up to gym use and washing.

I also don't usually cut the front neckline of the shirt, so it might get a little revealing if you cut as much as is in the tutorial. 

The back pretty much follows the curve of a standard racerback style sports bra.

[August 2012 and July 2013.](http://imgur.com/iV53MuJ)
 
The body on the left here was about 103kg. It could and did walk about 3km in about 30 minutes, and at this point could swim 700m with a pause every lap or two. It was a pretty good body, and I liked it. 
 
But I thought that walking and swimming could be easier; and a little bit of simple physics suggested that if I were a bit lighter, it might be.
 
At the end of August 2012, I decided to change. I started mainly with my diet: exercise stayed the same, more or less. I chose a ketogenic diet after some reading. It worked really well for me - it was easy for me to stick to, and it worked. By early January, I had lost around 26-27kg, and walking and swimming were much easier.
 
But I decided I wanted to do something more. I wanted to be fitter. And so I joined a gym, found a personal trainer, and began strength training - weight lifting.
 
Since January, my weight on the scales has remained fairly constant. It's gone up and down by a couple of kilos. But my body shape has changed radically. I'm roughly the same dress size I was in January, but pants fit very differently now. A year ago, I was wearing size 20 (Australian) pants. Today, I mostly wear size 12.
 
The body on the right can walk and run 6km in 45 minutes, and can sprint for short distances at up to 14kmh. That body can deadlift 100kg, can leg press 240kg, and can squat with 80kg across her shoulders. That body can swim 2km without stopping. That body can bench press 42.5kg.

My whole life, I've been the chubby girl, hovering at around 155 pounds. Stress, overeating and lack of exercise made my weight spiral out of control in the summer of 2010. I injured my knee because of the extra weight I was carrying on it and was unable to keep up with the kids at the summer camp at which I was instructing.

When I got home in September, I decided that enough was enough. My routine at that time was about half an hour of cardio five days a week and vaguely cutting back on calories without tracking them or having a goal in mind. Of course, if I could start all over again I'd do it differently, but it did allow me to drop pounds dramatically. At the start of the summer of 2011, I was down 30 pounds to about 153, but hitting a plateau. Being a cardio bunny wasn't doing me any favours, and I was unwilling to restrict my food intake. Carbs have always been my favourites and I would binge on cookies and pasta.

A broken wrist and lack of motivation made it so that I hovered at my plateau of 150-155 for almost a full year. I was only able to start breaking through it starting September 2012, when I added weight lifting to my cardio days. I swallowed my pride and asked  a friend of mine how to do barbell lifts. I was intimidated, but that feeling of dragging a really heavy weight up and then putting it back down started an addiction.

The last step to my weight loss was joining myfitnesspal in November. It's been a lifesaver! As a data junkie, having all that information at my fingertips has allowed me to know myself and my body better. I learned that I was eating way too little protein, and that I always get cravings when I don't eat enough fat.

At the moment, I'm eating 1400 calories a day, with always at least 100g of protein. Cheat days happen about every three weeks, and although I try to keep them in check I do love my food. I lift three days a week, long sessions with a ton of accessory work. A next step is moving onto a split schedule, since right now my weights days include so much accessory work that I'm at the gym for at least an hour and a half. Here are my stats for lifting:

Bench: 3x5 at 85 lbs

Squat: 3x5 at 120 lbs

Deadlift: 3x5 at 135 lbs

I also do three days a week of cardio, which consists of running, HIIT, complexes, rowing or whatever my body is craving. 

Next steps: keep cutting until I lose the rest of my stomach and saddlebags, then start a bulk to get dat ass. I'd like to move to a split lifting schedule and would love your comments and advice on where to go from here.

A little backstory for context: I'm 4'10"" and I get carded all the time even though I'm 28. I weighed three pounds when I was born and had to stay in the hospital for a month and get fed through a tube up my nose. I wasn't even premature. My mom is 4'9"" and my mom's side of the family is quite small. I was ALWAYS the smallest person in my class, and I got teased relentlessly. The worst part is my bony chicken legs. 

So I posted on r/gainit a few days ago after having a revelation at my gym that I have been doing way too much cardio and it has been negating the weightlifting I do. So now I'm really trying to gain muscle weight. Now I don't stay at the gym for an extra hour to do cardio at the end of my workout, which is weird to me because I enjoy zoning out and running to top off my workout. I didn't feel like going straight home yesterday, so I decided to grab a beer at a sports bar close to my house. 

I looked at my legs and thought maybe I should go home to change so nobody would make fun of my bony legs. I decided to just go get a beer. I tied a sweatshirt around my waist. Well, as soon as I sat down this lady next to me started badgering me about my age, so I showed her my ID to shut her up. She went on to say I had lost 50 pounds, which is ridiculous and downright laughable. I was wearing a turtleneck in the driver's license picture, and my hair and makeup were done to perfection because you only get a new picture every eight years, so I wanted my photo to look good.

I told her I work out on the regular and have a high metabolism, and that my mother is extremely petite. She looked at my legs and said, ""Oh, you LIKE looking like that"" even though I am extremely self conscious and paranoid about it! I rolled my eyes and as she got up to leave she said, ""God bless you. I hope you make it through the year."" I really had to bite my tongue and hold back, and I was too shocked to really know what to say.

I told the manager, who I know, what happened because I was LIVID, and all of a sudden I started to CRY. So embarrassing. The lady straight up called me anorexic. My older sister had to get treatment for anorexia 10 years ago. It's a serious disease, and I have never starved myself. I thought back and remembered one time in 6th grade at the lunch table, a girl called me anorexic AS I WAS EATING MY LUNCH. And she was on my softball team, in which I was the starting pitcher.

I would NEVER have the audacity to berate someone I don't even know (or know) about their weight, appearance and age, whether they were thin or heavy. It blows my fucking mind that people feel like they have the right to do that to people who just happen to be really small and look young. I wish I would have clocked that lady in the face with a Unity ring. This happens to me way too often, and I feel like I will bitch slap the next person who does this to me, even if it means getting arrested.

And I thought, 'you go girl.' Because the girl was overweight, yet clearly wanted to make some positive change in her life. 

Later in the stretch room I saw the same pair going over the work they just did while the trainer let the girl through some cool down exercises. In their conversation the girl said this, ""I know, sometimes I don't work are hard as I could, I know I should be *working much harder* [at fitness or whatever]."" 

And at that moment the trainer got this look on her face. This exasperated look. Like she knew that something she'd just been trying to teach got lost along the way. 

I knew what the trainer was thinking because I've see this hardcore attitude a lot among my own female friends who start working out when they realize they're a bit chunkier than they wanted to be. It's the attitude that since they're now overweight, they have to work really hard at fitness to compensate for their 'bad' habits. Not only are they wanting to work out, they've also got something to prove. 

So they pile on with the dieting and the working out every single say of the week and usually one or two things happens, they get injured or they stop working out after a few months because they realize they're exhausted and they hate working out every day. 

I've read a lot of posts here going along the lines of 'I'm overweight and don't do anything, and I want to start running/lifting heavy/get on their serious athletic diet.' I see this attitude and wanted to comment on it as someone who has been pursuing fit for a number of years and did successfully manage to go from skinny-fat to decently athletic. 

***

I know going from 0-60 works for some people, maybe they really need the structure or their brains just work that way, but otherwise, I wonder if deciding you're going to take up some kind of hardcore cardio program from being completely sedentary isn't getting a little ahead of yourself, because in my personal experience the people who get the best results are **very carefully incremental about their fitness goals.**

Being unfit is a lot like starting at level one in a video game. It doesn't take much to get to level two, just kill a couple rats or something and BAM, level two. Subsequent levels get a lot harder, but before you break level ten all you really need to do is show up, get out, walk around a little, work on your form, and your progress will be exponential. It's a good time, you'll never get such good results for comparatively little work again. 

So if you're sedentary, make sure to take your 20 minute walk every day, and if you want to lose weight, first start by cooking your own balanced means more often. No need for the diets and the crazy training programs. It's good to learn and have goals for yourself but when you start fitness the real work is in trying to do these good little habits consistently, not forcing yourself to strive past all reasonable levels of endurance all the time. Maybe at some point you'll want to do that, but as a beginner is not the time. Always make fitness first something that you can enjoy as a part of your life, not a responsibility that saps all your vitality and joy. 

Being incremental is good for two reasons, it's far less stressful, and when you progress incrementally, you actually develop the body awareness that is going to help you to not get injured when you try harder things. Don't get injured, it sucks. And don't burn out.

I have been here, mostly lurking for some time now, but I felt like this was something that needed to be shared!

For several years I've been a pretty dedicated athlete. I workout 6 days a week and most days I do at least 45min of cardio + 25-45min of strength and weights, throw in my long run and long bike ride on the weekends and some yoga and it's clear that I really love working out and do it a lot. What I never accepted was... I need to eat.

I really believed that 1200 calories was supposed to be enough for me, then I joined MFP and thought that 1200 net would work, but I restricted (or tried) to 800-1000 net every day. 

Finally. I reached my limit. I was depressed, cold all of the time, exhausted, irritable, no sex drive, and not making any progress in my fitness. I was finding it harder and harder to maintain the 6 workout days, and I pulled out of 2 races this year. So, I started researching... I read, and read, and read any article I could get my hands on. I studied the science until my brain hurt and I FINALLY started eating more. I decided to believe the math and science instead of all of the diet dogma.

Today it's been 8 days of eating about 2000 calories a day. I'm sleeping better, running better, cycling better, thinking about food less, and feeling SO much happier. My body is sort of freaking out. I'm a little bloated, I've got some new fat around my middle, but apparently this is all part of the healing process and it could take months for me to lean out again. My weight has seemed to stabilize after an initial week of pretty gnarly bloating and whatnot. 

Right now my focus is on body recomposition.
http://gokaleo.com/2012/09/19/body-composition-that-last-five-pounds-and-how-to-deal-with-problem-areas/

I'm already noticing more definition in my abs, legs and arms. I'm really excited to get healthy. I don't have much patience so admittedly waiting for my body/metabolism/relationship with food to have enough time to really heal is effing hard. I keep telling myself to relax and enjoy eating at maintenance for a while and then when it comes time to shed a little fat I'm going to have the most kick ass six-pack ever. 

So, basically, don't sit around starving all day! It's not worth it, seriously, I did it for 5 years. It's not the only way. I hope :) This is all an experiment, and I'm documenting it all to hopefully give others hope that they can be fit and healthy and slim and lean and not starve.

I have gained weight very unevenly so I have a bit of a spare tire around my midsection that I'm self-conscious about. (It has caused no less than 3 people on the subway to offer me their seat because they thought I'm pregnant.) I used to swim competitively and by nature am on the athletic side, but due to depression and a smoking habit I picked up in college, I've gained a lot of weight in the past few years. I quit smoking almost 2 months ago and now that my lungs have cleared a little bit I've been getting back to cardio which is my ""bread and butter"" (figuratively speaking). 

Earlier this evening I was out for a jog by the beach, per my new nightly ritual (I look forward to it all day). I jog in an area very popular for recreation since it is near two large parks with sports fields and historic monuments, right by the water/local docks, and there's a wide sidewalk by a winding road. Well-lit, relatively safe area. People from Boston probably know exactly where I am talking about. You'll see all types and sizes of people out in this area. While my spare tire has made me a little self-conscious about being seen by the people down there who obviously run the marathon, I haven't let it get to me. 

So I jogged a few miles and my left leg shin splints kicked in. I'd felt them mildly a few times before but this time they were worse than I've ever felt (I think because I'm able to run faster/farther now), and I was pretty much just dragging myself home - jogging where I could to keep my split time reasonable (GPS app on my phone timing my pace). Up ahead there was a crowd of shitbags loitering, taking up half the sidewalk. Not that unusual, but as a rule I keep my distance from other people to be respectful and hopefully go unnoticed. I kept jogging to get by them without delay. As I jogged by the group, this teenage kid started jogging beside me, in pace with me, flailing his arms and imitating my sore gait. He followed me for a short ways then turned back to the rest of the group of shitbags, who laughed. 

Like yea, I know I need to lose weight. Thanks for being cruel about it. 

As an introvert this was a nightmare. As a native Bostonian I wanted to flip him off or tell him to go fuck himself (as I've been wont to do), but I didn't want to be harassed, so I completely ignored him. 

When I got back to my apartment, tired and sore, I cried a little bit. Just because of some shithead stranger on the street. 

If the world could just stop pointing out that I'm not the correct weight while I'm desperately trying to fix it, that would be great. 

It was so discouraging. It makes me want to never go jogging that way again, which is of course ridiculous because I love jogging with a sea breeze. This is the first time I've ever detected any hostility towards people who are out of shape jogging in that area - I've even seen joggers high-five each other as they cross paths. In my experience Boston is a friendly city (or at least more-so than other cities I've lived in), and this is one of the only negative interactions with a stranger on the street I've ever had.

I know I'm way too sensitive and I take things way too hard. When I see an overweight or obese person exercising I think ""hey good for him/her,"" if anything at all, so it was shitty to experience someone openly mocking me for being overweight while I was literally in the middle of trying to better myself. 

Sorry for the needlessly long explanation, and thanks for listening. I feel better after writing about it.

**Question**: How have you successfully prevented shin splints?

**Edit:** Thank you all so much for the encouraging words! Sometimes jerks are jerks. I won't be bullied off my jogging route! &lt;3

**Edit 2:** holy shiiiit, way more people responded to this than I thought. Again thank you all so much for the encouragement (it put tears in my eyes!) and shin splints advice.

I went from the photo on the left to the photo on the right in a span of two years. It took a whole lifestyle change, blood, sweat, tears and dedication to get to where I am now. Being called fat by people SUCKED, especially since I grew up thin, was thin in high school and only had gained the weight while in a tumultuous relationship after high school. I wasn't used to it. It was terrible.

I posted the below information in a comment on another redditor's post. He had inquired about what motivators could enable him to keep on working out. I just decided to tell a little story about how I got to where I am now and what kept me going:

My transformation came in stages, and it wasn't easy. I set mini goals and when I was able to reach them I set new ones. I feel like this allows you to stay motivated because the goals are attainable. My first goal was to just lose any sort of weight. I went to the track after work and would just jog until I couldn't anymore, then walk until my breath got back to a normal state and then I would do it all over again for anywhere between 3-4 miles a day.

I ended up losing 36 lbs this way around the end of the summer of 2011. I was also a vegetarian (although my eating choices still weren't the most informed as I was eating a lot of frozen vegetarian dishes). I started eating meat around October and then I then started to make some really smart food choices and actually researching nutrition.

I joined Crossfit in January of 2011 at 150 lbs and in 2 months I went down to 135 lbs. Crossfit is pretty expensive but I got the knowledge on proper form, lifting and nutrition. I also felt it was really easy for me to go because I had spent the money on a membership, didn't want to waste it and the comradery is so motivating! I now eat about 80/20 Paleo/Non Paleo.

I decided to start lifting at another gym with my boyfriend and that is where I am currently at. So far I have lost another 3 lbs this month. I can now do three consecutive pullups. I like to flex my muscles in the mirror and I check myself out. I love it when my clothes get smaller but I get STRONGER. I also had a girl e-mail me telling me I was her inspiration and she has lost 30 lbs already. I started crying. I came a fucking LONG WAY from where I used to be and I am still stunned about my entire transformation and even more stunned someone is using my transformation as their motivation.

I'm sorry if there's a specific subreddit for this - if there is please direct me to it and I will post it there instead. I feel like if I put this here, maybe someone will see it and be encouraged to run that extra mile, or maybe a girl will see this, not feel intimidated and start reading Starting Strength. All it takes is a goal and a desire to be fit!

**TL;DR - I lost 54 lbs in two years, changed my whole life around and I believe that if you want it - you can obtain it.**

Last night I got fired up and re-motivated from all the support from you ladies.  I didn't want to let one crappy experience ruin everything I have been working towards. I used google to find a real strength coach in my area, called him and gave him the run-down of my crappy day.  He trained me today for half an hour (for free!!) and it was AWESOME.  I felt STRONG!  

Thanks for all the support and encouragement ladies - it really helped, got me re-focused and made me realize I needed to invest in a legit coach to learn what I want to learn.  Before you know it, I'll be squatting like a pro.  

My advice to those who think like me and worry about starting a strength program - Don't be intimidated!  And don't let anyone tell you that you can't do it!  Start slow (I started with 10 pound dumbbells) and find a real strength coach if you are nervous.

I've seen posts in the past about people asking about what type of exercises they can do at home, with little space, or without any equipment. I thought I'd put together a post that has a list with explanations of some of the workouts that can be done at home without any equipment (well, besides stuff you probably already have at home such as a towel, low table, chair) and most can be done with little space. Please, please, please add your own workouts that fall into this category as I'm sure my list is exhaustive and I have failed to include someone's favorite workout or a variation that can be done. Also, unfortunately, I don't know that many upper body workouts that don't use weights, but share, share, share, and I can incorporate them into my workout too!

I tried to organize them based on what part of the body they work, but as you can imagine, this can be hard since some of the workouts incorporate numerous parts. I think there might be a limit on post lengths, so I'm going to do three separate posts: one for abs, arms, and back (this one); a second one for legs and glutes; and a final one for plyometrics/cardio. 

I've included links with pictures (when I could find them) for illustrative purposes that I found via Google. For those that don't have links with pictures, I tried to explain them as best as I could. If you don't understand, let me know, and hopefully I, or someone else, can explain it better. Perhaps if really, really necessary, I'll try to take a headless picture of myself doing it. (I don't love the idea of posting a picture of myself on reddit, but if it's to help someone... I might, if I can figure out how to do a self-shot of myself doing the move lol).

I hope you ladies find these posts helpful!

PS: I might not have the right terminology for all of them...sorry! Also, I apologize if there's any bad formatting!

***Abs***

-[**Mountain climbers**](http://dorkyhousewife.blogspot.com/2010/07/maximum-results-mountain-climber.html)

   -[**Cross body mountain climbers**](http://www.womenshealthsa.co.za/fitness/workouts/boost-your-metabolism-and-drop-a-size-workout?page=6) This will add a workout to your obliques.

-[**Plank**](http://www.cookinglight.com/healthy-living/fitness/5-core-moves-00400000041884/page2.html) You can also do it with your arms straight like you were doing a push up, but with your hands directly under your shoulders.

   -**Plank with one arm up** - lift an arm in front of you to make it harder to balance.

  -**Plank with one leg up** - lift a leg up to behind you to make it harder to balance.

   -**Around the world plank** - in the plank position slowly move your hands either clockwise or counter-clockwise while maintaining the plank position.

   -**Plank twist** - You're in plank and then you twist your hips so that one hip is closer to the floor, but your moves stay in the same place. This will work your obliques.

   -[**Walk out planks**](http://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/trainers-reveal-best-abs-exercises-all-time?page=20)

   -[**Towel planks**](http://www.shape.com/fitness/workouts/trainers-reveal-best-abs-exercises-all-time?page=4) The same idea as a mountain climber, but you keep your foot on the floor and slide it.

   -[**Side planks**](http://fictionalcorporeality.blogspot.com/2010/08/flatten-that-tum.html) You can do it on your elbow or like the picture. You can hold it for several seconds and go back to regular plank and then switch to the other side or you can lower your hip down and raise it up again. You can make it easier by bending the bottom leg so there’s more of your body in contact with the floor.

   -[**Side planks with “threading the needle”**](http://www.military.com/opinion/0,15202,210595,00.html) This adds more of a workout for your obliques. 

-**Standing crunch** – I couldn’t find a picture for this, but basically you stand up straight and as you bring one knee up you crunch forward making sure you keep your bellybutton to your spine. 

-**Standing oblique knee raise** – This isn’t the right name, but basically you’re standing with your legs a little further than hip width apart and you bring your knee up and bring the opposite elbow to the knee and try to get them to touch.

-[**Bicycles**](http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises.htm)

-[**Reverse crunch**](http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_7.htm) 

-[**Long arm crunch**](http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_6.htm) This is like adding a weight to your crunch

-[**Crunch with heel push**](http://exercise.about.com/od/abs/ss/abexercises_8.htm) 

-[**External oblique exercise**](http://trainingtipsfromelliot.tumblr.com/post/13363808923/external-oblique-exercise) You can also do this with your bottom leg down instead of just staying in the air, or you can have it extend down and out when your head goes down. 

***Arms***

-[**Pushups**](http://shahanastyle.blogspot.com/2012/02/push-up-power.html) By slightly varying where your hands are you can work different muscles. You can modify by putting your knees down, or increase the intensity by clapping at the top of each pushup.

-[**Triceps pushup**](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/fitness/tricep-pushup)

-[**Triceps dips**](http://www.realsimple.com/health/fitness-exercise/workouts/triceps-workout-00000000033062/page3.html) These can be done at the edge of a coffee table or chair. You can increase the intensity by extending one leg out straight or both legs (with your heels still on the floor) so less of your body is in contact with the floor.

***Back***

-**Back extensions** - I couldn’t find any pictures of just the back extension so I’m probably calling it the wrong thing, but you lie on the floor on your stomach with your arms by your side and lift your trunk as high as possible without straining your back and then you lower your trunk back down. You can do it with your arms out in front of you as well. And you can also lift your legs up, which works different muscles in your back. 

-[**Superman**](http://www.sparkpeople.com/resource/exercises.asp?exercise=191)

I've been going to see a personal trainer since August 20 to learn how to move properly and to get in shape.  I'd lost 20 pounds before going to see him, and tried to do some exercises at home when I started this journey at 223 pounds. 

When I started with the trainer upper body work always finished with shoulder presses.  My body was tired from lifting for almost an hour, and I could barely lift 2.5 pounds.  We'd do 3 sets of 15 reps, and after 2 reps I'd have to put the weights down and lift the rest with my own body weight.  I felt like such a failure!  But my trainer told me shoulders are one of the weakest parts of the body, and he's seen some very fit people fail shoulder presses.  He gave me a home routine to build my shoulder muscles.

Now we're starting to really lift weights.  The last session I had with him (Wednesday of last week) he made me grab two 15 pound weights and do shoulder presses.  I did 3 sets of 10 reps, and when I was done I just turned to my trainer and said ""DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I COULDN'T EVEN LIFT 2.5 POUNDS??!!""  Clearly, I was very excited about my progress, and so was he.

Then this weekend I was doing a home routine and was doing jumping jacks.  Now realize that anything with jumping at 223 pounds is hard and painful.  I remember being able to do 10 jumping jacks and nearly having a heart attack.  Last night I did 75 jumping jacks.  

I'm just purely amazed at the progress my body is making.  ",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,bench,True,t3_147ond,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/147ond/nsv_sometimes_my_body_amazes_me/,

I've had four or five times where I just walked by the weight room and used the other set of dumbbells instead. Getting over myself has been harder than normal.  Well yesterday I'd gone into work early so I made it to the gym before 5 and decided that I'd at least go use the dumbbells in the weight room (my gym has dumbbells like 4 different places) well there were only a couple guys in there and I decided it was as good of time as any. I did bench presses, barbell squats, and deadlifts. I also ended up doing more weight than I expected. My initial expectations were that I would be happy if I could bench and squat the bar (45 lbs) but without going to my max I beat that by at least 15-20lbs on each movement and was able to complete all my sets. I did not embarass myself, I didn't hurt myself. and I feel more like I actually worked out than I have in a long time. I'm sold. 

I'm basing my routines on Starting Strength, so FWIW here are my final sets for yesterday. I feel like I could have done more weight but I'm going to go slow so I don't hurt myself or get discouraged.

I've had it since I was a month old. I was so sick as a child I spent a lot of my childhood in a hospital (which is one of the reasons I became a nurse) and couldn't really play in any sports except dance and cheer because I needed my inhaler. As i got older and stopped doing as many activities my asthma got worse. Recently I was hospitalized for a week with a severe asthma attack and pneumonia. I was so sick they wanted to put me an ICU but luckily I was stabilized before they could get a bed! I made the decision to change the minute I walked out of the hospital.I lurked on xxfitness the whole time I was in the hospital and found great advice. I was cleared to start working out a week after being released. The first day was awful. I could barely walk briskly on the treadmill without needing my inhaler. Well its been 3 weeks now and I can jog at 4.5mph at a 4 incline for almost a mile without needing my inhaler! I've done Zumba twice without needing it as well! Which is something I could NEVER do!  I've started lifting and when my HR goes up I enjoy it and don't need my inhaler. I changed my diet completely and I feel great!  If you have severe asthma you understand what it is like and how great this feels! I'm just so happy I can breath!

I had a tummy, my arms were shapeless, and my ass was somewhat non-existent. I began running, cutting calories, eventually started lifting weights, bulking, cutting, bulking, cutting, trying anything to get my last few bf% points down.

Most recently I turned to keto, which, though a good diet choice for many, especially if they need to lose a lot of weight, was an extreme and hard diet for me, who doesn't NEED to lose any weight at all. It really just zapped my energy and made my lifts pitiful. 

So finally I realized: I don't want to LOOK better, I want to FEEL better. Which means SOME carbs. Which means NOT obsessing over the scale. Which means NOT freaking out about logging every single bite of food that goes into my mouth. Which means listening to my body. Am I ever going to stop counting calories in my head? Probably not. But I am going to count up to a higher number so my lifts don't suffer. And those calories are going to come from clean, natural foods. 

For those of you who are curious, I started exactly a year ago at 5'2"" and 126ish lbs. I am now 5'2"" and 111 lbs. I eat around 1500 calories a day, though I may up that to 1700 for a while to get my lifts back. 

Anyway, that's my mini speech. Hope you all have a wonderful day and get to hit the gym so you can FEEL good! =]

I have come across several in the past few years that I keep taped up where I can see them. :)

Some of my favorites:

1. **""Exercising and eating healthy is hard.  Being overweight and unhealthy is hard.  Pick your hard.""**  (source unknown)

2. **""Train to be awesome""** ~Nia Shanks

3. **""To get the body you want, you must love the body you have.""** 
 (source unknown, this drives home how we can never achieve the body we want if we're always beating it up with negative thoughts and actions)

4. **""...I never diet.  Instead, I focus on sustaining my weight and elevating my fitness level""**
  (~Sylwia Weisenberg- in relation to diets and ""get thin/fit quick"" promises)

5. **""Do what you feel to be right in your heart, for you will be criticized anyway.""** ~Eleanor Roosevelt  
(Can be applied to how you approach fitness.  That is, whether you love heavy weights or cardio without feeling the need to defend why you workout the way you do, but also other areas of life as well)

I used to like ""strong is the new skinny"" until I realized that the execution of it is such that it's really ""skinny with muscles"" that's being touted. :/

So for many years I stuck mainly to men's tennis shoes. 

Today I went to get new running shoes. I wear a size 9 in ladies, in a normal width. I don't remember the last time I could pick a shoe off the rack and have it fit. That's *really* cool. 

For you ladies who have looked in maternity -even though there is no baby in your oven- to find your size or had to go from one store to another because XL is a vanishing breed at malls and 2XL+ is almost impossible outside of a plus size store.

I was fairly prepared, and excited to go. I was doing it solo, and was looking forward to a good race, when the countdown started and with a bang we ran.

Suddenly, period.

WHAT?! A week early!! But there it was unmistakably, the feeling and oh my lord, so much. I wanted to cry. Barely 5 mins in! How could I run like this?!

First bathroom I go to, NO toilet paper! I am getting desperate, I continue an awkward run shuffle until I see a first aid van.

The nurse sees my pain and offers a smile, but when she hears my problem her face drops, no help from her! They have nothing to give me, not even a bandage (nice to know they're prepared). She says I can see how I go, or just drop out. 

But I can't leave the race, I have to finish. I would feel even worse... and it's only 5k right?

So I continued.

The whole 5k, mostly walking, but the occasional jog until I the motion is too much for my uterus. At one point I found a toilet with some toilet paper, and I rolled it up as a makeshift pad, but alas as I walked it slid down my leg and oh my god.

Mortifying.

I've been lurking here a while and figured I should contribute in hopes of inspiring someone else.
I've been weight lifting, eating clean and doing minimal cardio (walks and bike rides, bad knees = no running :( )) for close to 4 months now, and these are my results:

http://imgur.com/a/s06Zx

I was far from overweight to start with, at 145, but I felt lazy and dough-ey and could hardly lift myself off the couch without grunting. Not to mention I hated nearly everything about myself. Luckily, my job provides a free gym membership, so I had no excuse not to start going!!

Now I'm around 126 with a 27 inch waist at 5ft8in. My biggest issue with my body before was stubborn back fat/love handles that I thought would never go away. But hey, they're almost completely gone, along with almost everything else that bothered me. I also had zero core strength...and now abs are the best part of my workout! I'm still having trouble with my abs showing through, but I'm sure I'll get there in a couple more months :) (any advice would be super!)

I've been eating 1500 calories a day, (cept for cheat days) mostly fruit and protein and veggies.  Some sugars, because hey...no one is perfect.

If anyone is interested, I would happily go into more detail :) I just thought it would be nice to show that ""fat skinny"" girls can improve themselves and feel a lot better!




EDIT: 

So! My routine goes a bit along these lines...I'll list what I started with and what I have worked up to...apologies if I get some of the terms wrong. n00b sauce. 


WEIGHTS: 

- I start with a light warmup jog of about 5 min. It's all I can really handle at this point with my knee being all bent out of shape (hawhaw)
- After jogging I do about 5 minutes of stretching, just basic stuff, with pigeon pose at the end for my knees.  All stretches held for 30 seconds or more.
- After stretching I use the assisted bench press. I started with 10lbs on both sides and have worked up to about 25 on both sides. 10lbs x 1 rep of 15 to 25lbs x 3 reps of 15
- French press 15lbs x 1 rep of 15
- bar squats with 5lbs on either side, 3 reps of 10
- Standing Dumbbell Side Bends, I started with 10lbs and have worked up to 25. So 10lbs x 3 sets of 15 to 25lbs x 3 sets of 20 ((these are great for lovehandles and waist slimming!))
- Lat pull downs, 40lbs x 1 rep of 15. I've upped to 50 lbs

Some things change from day to day. I'm always aiming to push myself a little bit harder with reps.  Also, I try out new machines and techniques when I see them and determine whether or not I want to add them to my routine.

ABS:

- Russian twists with a 6lb ball. 15 twists for each oblique, so 30 total. I've worked up to an 8lb ball, 60 twists.
- V sits (also known as ""boat pose"") Hold the v pose for 5 seconds, 5 times.  I've worked up to 30 seconds, 4 times. 
- 90degree crunches.  I started with 1 rep of 15, and have worked up to 60.
- Planks. I started with 10 seconds x 10 reps. I've worked up to a full 1:30 plank. The MOST important part of a plank is having good form, so don't try to jump into it. It took me a while to work up to a minute while keeping proper form.

FLOOR:

- I do donkey kicks after abs because it's a floor exercise , and I'm already on the floor, so...
- 15 donkey kicks for both legs, 1 rep. 
- 15 side kicks for both legs, 1 rep. I added a leg weight and have upped my reps to 20. These are great for yer ass.

I am not by any means a professional, and this may not be the workout for everyone. I had a day with a personal trainer who showed me most of this routine, but I added and deleted a lot of stuff when my knee started hurting. So, it's important to talk to a professional so they can assess what's right for you.
Also, I take a day off from weights/abs the day after I workout.  This is when I do ""cardio,"" which generally consists of a 1-2 hour walk, a bike ride, etc.  The MOST important thing I've done is watch what I eat!!! You can burn calories by eating less, if you're not doing enough cardio.  Stay in the 1200-1500 range for weight loss and don't go under!!! At LEAST 1200 a day, or your body will go into starvation mode and you won't see any progress. Your muscles need food to grow. I eat at least 40g of protein a day ((""think thin"" bars are GREAT! No sugar and no gluten!!)) and lots of fruits and veggies and nuts and stuff.  Everyone has weak moments though,  and that's okay! Everything in moderation. 

I hope some of this helps :) I had a lot of stress when I first started and wanted to quit just about every day.

Today I hit my fitness/weight loss goal, and I want to share it with you all as you've been so helpful in motivating me.

Some background - up until a year or so ago, I suffered from SVT.  I think I'd had symptoms for six or seven years, but had always assumed it was normal.  My symptoms were so bad I'd been unable to exercise - not that I noticed much, leading a pretty sedentary life anyway.  After being unexpectedly hospitalised during my second year of university from flu complications relating to my heart, I suspected it might not be normal for my heart to randomly beat at 200bpm for several minutes at a time 20 times a day, so got referred to the cardiac department of my local hospital for diagnosis and eventually an ablation.  

I had the ablation in January 2012 and all went smoothly.  I made a resolution to exercise once I'd been given the all-clear, and finally develop some level of fitness.  I was pretty unhappy with my body - I'd packed on over a stone since getting to uni, through living in catered halls where the food was chips with everything and limited vegetables in my first year, and cooking with my (bigger than me, male) housemates in second and third year.  I managed to crash diet my way into a dress for a ball in second year through basically eating nothing for a couple of weeks, but I'm pretty certain that was all water weight.  So, along with resolving to get fit, I resolved to lose weight and get back to where I was before I came to university.  

I did this through a combination of the [NHS Couch to 5k podcasts](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/couch-to-5k-plan.aspx) with support from /r/c25k, the [Nike Training Club app](http://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/c/womens-training/apps/nike-training-club), [Fitocracy](https://www.fitocracy.com/track/) and tracking what I ate on [Cronometer](http://cronometer.com/) and later [MFP](http://myfitnesspal.com/).  I finished C25K by the end of the summer break, managing the full 5k in 45 minutes.  Since then, my PB for 5k has dropped to 33:25 (I'm aiming for sub-30 by the end of the summer break this year, hopefully before), I've moved up to the intermediate stage workouts on the NTC app, and I've lost quite a bit of weight - over a stone by the end of the summer.  

Getting back to uni I stagnated a bit - not focusing on what I ate as much as getting my assignments done, and not getting to the gym as often as I'd have liked.  However, my graduation ball is coming up, and I wanted to be able to wear a dress I wore to a wedding when I was 14 (I haven't grown height-wise since, and it's a really /really/ nice dress...).  In October, I couldn't even do the catch at the top, let alone doing the zip up.  After my January exams, I could just about zip it up if I stopped breathing.  

After a few days of a few too many Creme Eggs and delicious cookies that were on sale, I finally stepped guiltily onto the scales today.  I'm down 24lb from where I was a year ago, I can run 6k without stopping at a decent pace, and I feel a lot better about myself.  

I worked up the courage to try the dress.  

It zips all the way, and it's even a bit loose!

Now I'm onto maintenance mode - I'm on the lower half of healthy by BMI and fit clothes I haven't been able to wear in years, trying to maintain my fitness, but trying not to lose any more lest this beautiful dress not fit me!  

I'd post pics, but my friends are on reddit and have my username.  They haven't seen the dress, and I don't want to spoil the surprise!

So thank you, ladies and gents, for all your support and motivation in getting me to the gym when I can't be bothered, and stopping me snacking on chocolate when I don't need to.

I got married August 2010. I was 109 kg (240 lbs) and I couldn't stand the way I looked. I was embarassed on my wedding day actually. I decided that I was going to change and get things back in control, for real. I had attempted in the past but never very seriously. Everytime I started experiencing stress, the brownie mix and all sorts of food came out. 

I started jogging and walking more, and starting swimming casually a few times a week. I also started biking more. I learned to not eat my feelings. 

By December 2010 I was down to 100 kg. Then a long trip to the US sent me back 4kg. By May 2011 I was down to 97kg or so. In September 2011 I moved to Sweden and proceeded to lose 5kg through the rest of the year. In February 2012 I finally dipped right under 90kg or so during a skiing trip to Austria. That summer (2012) I reached 84kg through eating less, walking a lot, running some, and swimming some. In September 2012 I started a new job that required commuting and by the new year of 2013 I was back at almost 92kg. I moved to be closer to my job because I didn't want to sit on a train 3 hours everyday and get fat again. In February I signed up for the BTFC here on reddit and got real. I joined my swim team and started exercising heavily and eating better. The weight loss has gone excruciatingly slow and last month I found out that my thyroid wasn't functioning 100% but its not terrible. 

Right now Im sitting around 84.5kg. I've lost 25kg since I got married a little less than 3 years ago. It hasn't been easy but wow I feel great. I swim 4-6 times a week, I bike a lot, and I've been doing the 30 day ab challenge (more like 60 days for me!) which has really improved my swimming form actually. 

For those out there that feel like giving up because it's slow going or because they've slipped a few times: Don't. Everyone slips. Everyone has days where the world is falling apart and nothing feels better than a bowl of brownie mix. Focus on how good exercise makes you feel and how good you feel when you eat right and try to stick with it. Be as consistent as possible but forgive yourself when it goes wrong.

First, I'd like to say that I love the shit out of this community.  You are all awesome, incredible, amazing women, and every single one of you has the power to achieve your goals, whatever they are.  Whatever the fuck they are.  

That said, I'm seeing a lot of ridiculousness in many of the recent posts.  I'm seeing posts by women who are ""scared"" or ""embarrassed"" to go work out, as though either of these things are good reasons for not going to the gym.  I'm seeing posts by women completely refusing to take any responsibility for their own workout programs, women who want all of the work done for them and are unwilling to put any extra effort forth themselves.  I'm seeing posts by women who want to improve their diet but won't eat any healthful foods because they ""don't like them"".  I'm seeing posts completely ignoring the FAQ, although I admittedly can't blame those folks TOO much since it isn't posted particularly prominently on this subreddit.

This shit has to stop.

Making the choice to get in shape, improve your lifestyle, fix your diet, and become more active is a fantastic thing, but it does not stop there.  You have to take responsibility for it.  You have to be willing to put forth effort.  You cannot expect the rest of the world to award you a gold star and a complimentary personalized diet and workout program.  You need to do some of the work yourself.  You cannot make excuses as to why you are unwilling to do some or all of it.  You do not get a pass for being ""scared"" to go to the gym.  You do not get a pass for not liking healthy food.  If you want to make that lifestyle change badly enough, you will either ovary up and deal with your fear or you will find a different way to make the change.  If you don't want it badly enough, then you won't do it.  And that's fine, if that's what you want.  But if that's what you want, then you do not get a pass to complain about the results you did not get with the work you did not do.

So I went into the hotel and asked whether they limited the fitness services to hotel guests and they told me about this great deal! It's amazing, and not advertised anywhere -- you have to go in and ask.

-  The fitness center is basically part of the hotel spa, so there's soft meditation music playing instead of drum-and-bass or top-40 stuff.  

- It's mostly empty after work since the hotel guests that exercise seem to prefer working out early morning and afternoon.  

- There's good cardio equipment, a salt-water pool and jacuzzi, free weights, and a sauna.  I usually have the dumbbell rack to myself.

- There's a great shower with free soap, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion.  The spa attendants will give you a toothbrush, razor, and even lend you a hairdryer.

- There's no contract or initiation fee.  I paid for 6 months up front.

- There's lemon-infused water and free fruit.  Faaaancy!

- You get a discount on spa services!  There's nothing like booking a pedicure after you've had a great workout.

With women who lift, it's the women who only lift the light weights to tone and with people who love cardio it's just leisurely doing the motion without putting any real effort, usually while reading a fashion magazine. These women are usually the ones wearing super coordinated stylish too short or tight outfits and a the dreaded makeup. 

Why would someone wear makeup to the gym if you're there to work and it'll just get sweat off if you're working hard enough. I have a confession, I put on makeup to go to the gym. I don't do a whole face but I do put on fresh, dark eyeliner. It's not so I can be the cutest girl at the gym and I know I am going to sweat it off during my workout because I am a budding distance runner. I love to run and anything below 3 miles just isn't that satisfying. Lifting if ok but pounding out miles is where it's at for me.

Even thought i know the long run of the week will be ok, it's still intimidating when you're starting out. Every person has had the experience of starting out, the point where you know what you're doing but are still building up quickly and know that you have so much more potential that what you do now. You go to the gym, track, piece of equipment or trails and can put out your new personal record but compared to the person next to you, it's not much. 

I apply eyeliner before every run as war paint. It's to make me feel strong, powerful and maybe a bit intimidating. I don't want people to see the doubt as I start (or finish sometimes) a run, I want to pretend I'm a total bad ass already as I'm putting out the work to become one. My eyeliner might as well be a superhero mask which I can hide behind a little and go out and the bad ass I know I can be. 

One day I will get over the worry I feel before the workout because it'll be part of my routine, but I'm not there yet. For me, wearing makeup is an indicator of how hard I intend to work that day.

This was mainly because of portion size and an addiction to sweet foods...a growing girl needs to eat a whole lot more, right? (wrong)

At one point, when I was about 13, I pretty much gave up on trying to be thin or pretty. It was never going to happen, so why even bother? Eventually I found myself at 20 years old and a whopping 152 kg (336 lbs). I'm 5'10"" with a large frame so I 'carried it well' I guess, but still, that's...alarming.

I'm not sure what finally gave me that kick to get healthy, but I think it was a combination of not wanting to die young, lurking [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) and letting go of my long-held resentment against thin, pretty girls. 

I started just counting calories, using the [/r/loseit](/r/loseit) FAQ to figure out how many calories I needed to eat, then attempting various physical fitness regimes like c25k and swimming three times a week. Currently not doing much other than a daily walk, but I plan to get back to swimming once I get into the swing of uni after the holidays.

Since I started in August last year, I've gone from 152 kg to 125kg (336&gt;276 lbs) which is about 4.5 kg (10 lbs) per month. I've got a long way to go but I'm halfway to my first major goal of 100kg/220 lbs, and I couldn't be prouder of myself. My self-confidence is through the roof,  I'm fitter and healthier than ever, and I can't wait to see what I look and feel like at a healthy weight.

But it's the way I've been, for as long as the positive part of me has wanted a fitter me, so here goes, ladies!  I really really hope someone has felt similarly and can show me a real person who's conquered their own inner demons:

The hardest part about fitness is that I honestly feel like two different people in my goals and wants.

On good days, I'm really happy with myself.  I say  no to sodas and sugary drinks, I eat light and good portions, turn down cheese and other fatty yet delicious foods, happily eat vegetables, have light meals, eat overall more lean.  I feel hunger, and I'm glad because I know that means I haven't stuffed myself, and that everything I've eaten has been put to good use.  And it feels great and is so effortless, it's like this is the real me all along and I'm on the path to forever being a lean goddess who eats good food.  Even if I'm not as lean as I'd like, I let it go and focus on the future.

On bad days, though, I'm a fucking she-devil that gets a high from eating fattening, fried, sweet, and cheese-covered food.  I eat fast food, with a large sweet tea or coke.  I crave to eat, even after knowingly (gleefully!) eating 1,200 calories in one meal, that I don't even want to try and eat something light to satiate my ""hunger"".  I want to eat more.  I can even recite facts in my head, like: ""I want to lose weight, this will set me back.  I already ate so much.  That one slice of dessert was 500 calories.  You just drank 300 calories of soda,"" etc.  And I don't care!!  I WANT to eat bad, almost like I want to sabotage myself.  I want cake.  I eat cake.  I want brownies.  I eat them.  I want a burrito, I eat a burrito.  I eat three if I want.  I feel full, and I eat more.  Let's order a pizza!  That thought excites me.  I LOVE PIZZA.  I could go on about the whole process of ordering and waiting for it to come to my door, and then eating way, way more than a 24 year old female should.

I say I get hungry quickly on bad days, but it's a different hunger; good day hunger is an empty, happy feeling where I feel like, ""Good, I haven't over-eaten, this is the way my body is supposed to feel sometimes, I should eat to fix it, but this is a good sign.""  Sometimes, on good day hungers, I want to push how long it is between meals, to see how in control of my body I am.  I like to eat less, less, proud of how strong I'm being at resisting food.  And when I do eat, it's little and so satistfying...  Bad day hunger is like a child.  It doesn't feel empty; it just wants more, like it's pushing my limit, and I want to push my limit, and I want more food.  I know it's not 'real' hunger.  It's way, way more powerful than real hunger because I want to eat.  And when I do eat, it's ecstasy.  Every flavor feels so decadent, luxurious.  Of COURSE I want whipped cream on that.  Yes, butter.  Always, butter!  Ranch on my pizza?  YES!  Slice after slice!  

Of course, sometimes that very night, after a huge, unhealthy, fattening meal I feel endless amounts of guilt.  I've laid in bed, stressed, wiggling my toes at a cuththroat pace just to squeeze out even two more calories burned that day, tensing my tummy and legs hoping at least I'm helping tone something.  My biggest enemy is myself and she is winning.

I'm going to sound like a kid, but I really mean this:  where does my willpower go?  How can I be so fierce some days, and others it's like a totally different person had all those desires and wants, and now I just want food? I think I really, really, struggle with moderation.  I don't think ""Just this once"" exists to me, as I'll eat a bad meal ""just this once"" and then, I look back and every day that week I ate an ""Exception meal"" for a special occasion and my good days are shrinking, right under my nose.  On good days I look at pictures of skinny-fit girls, thinking, ""I'm on my way to that!"" On bad days I look at those pictures, and get a sinking feeling: ""I'm not that yet and I never will be her so long as I am me, and I don't know how to not be this way.  I will only get older and my metabolism will only slow down more.""  It's like the optimism I once had never was mine, and I never felt like achieving that was possible.


[edit:  I think I got a bit creative with the writing, sorry for all the drama hahah.  Every fact is true, I just wanted to convey the urgency and narrow-sightedness of both my good, healthy times and my falling off the bandwagon times]
[edit2:] I wanted to thank everyone who's commented so far!!  I think right now, I'm over-reacting because I didn't have a solution, so now I need a firmer plan for balance, so that I don't basically relapse into guilt-free crazy eating, having a bit of extra snacks that I like too!

Had to work late today, was quite stressed, couldn't look more forward to my workout. (For anyone familiar with playing the Sims, I definitely had those little lightning bolts sticking out of the top of my head)


Normally I go to the gym when it's fairly empty, around 4pm. But yea, had to work late. It was super super crowded. Bros as far as the eye could see, and then I walked into the cardio room for my warm up and there was a spin class going on. So pretty much every machine was taken up, providing a nice large audience for things to come. EXCEPT for my machine, my lovely treadmill, the one I love most. I saunter up to it and make the dreadful mistake of looking at the spin class instead of at my machine. 


Some douchenozzle had actually left the machine roaring at a speed of 8mph, and was nowhere in sight. Well there was the added benefit at least that I've never felt lighter, my body careening through the air straight at the damn spin class. 


I'm fine, have a few scrapes and my dignity is a little bruised but thank FSM, I didn't break or seriously injure anything.

I have been jogging every morning for 3 months and have become inspired by how much more I can run each morning. I started out running with a friend, but he stopped two weeks ago.

As soon as he stopped, I have been attacked every morning that I've been alone. I can see him/her waiting for me on the stop sign every morning, and as soon as I run past it, he/she swoops down and chases and pecks me for the next quarter mile. This continues on my way back.

One day, I asked another person to jog with me to see if it will stop the bird. Sure enough, the bird is waiting, but just stalks from a far. 

It's gotten to the point where it is deterring me from running. I tried scaring it, but I am just not scary. There are no other paths for me to take in my small town. Help, please?

The following commences on my facebook:

----------------------------

Guy: more reps and less weight. don't get into the numbers game. that's for muscleheads. you want lean muscle with definition. lots of variation, light weight, 15-20 reps, full extensions. make you look like a ripped goddess. and the mass will be functional outside the gym. all that grunting and groaning is silly. you should be sweating, not grunting. circuit training is good and fast, but using free weights in between each station really mixes it up. p90x type workouts aren't hype. it's just the basics of using tons of muscles instead of isolating your biceps on a bench press. &lt;gag&gt;

Me: Actually, lower weight higher rep is what bodybuilders do for hypertrophy: heavy 5x5's are for pure strength, and as a relatively testosterone-less female it'd be impossible for me to gain much mass either way. Definition comes more from lower body fat than it does from exercise, ""variation"" and ""mixing it up"" are nice words for ""no clear goal or linear progression,"" p90x doesn't build strength and bench press is actually a compound barbell movement that does a hell of a lot more than work your biceps, mostly because bench press is a pushing exercise and has absolutely nothing to *do* with biceps, which are used for pulling.

Me: *p90x doesn't build muscle, rather.

Him: i see you are working out with a body builder. 

Me: Nope. Bodybuilders work out for show, doing much isolation work and keep their reps within the 12-20 range. I want to be strong. It's much cooler.

---------------------------

(*Not to diss body builders, they're cool in their own right...hi super_luminal! Your bikini comp was awesome!)

Don't you love when people try to broscience all over you? *sigh*

**EDIT** As it's been pointed out, yes: I was off with the bodybuilder stats. I never intended to imply that bodybuilders were weak at all, or that they did not strength train, but was reacting to the ""higher rep!"" instruction, albeit improperly.

**My Story**

I decided in the end of July to take my fitness more seriously. My boyfriend at the time was really active, and I wanted to keep up with him. I wasn't dissatisfied with my body, but I was dissatisfied with what it couldn't do. Earlier in the year, I had completed Couch to 5K, so I knew I had the willpower to become more active. I decided to challenge myself to see if I could: (1) become more active/healthy/fit and (2) lose weight and meet a goal.

For cardio, I cycle. I go everywhere by bike: to school (12 miles roundtrip with hills), to work (7 miles roundtrip), to friends' houses (5-7 miles rountrip). It's a great workout, and it's made my quads super strong and hard.

In the beginning, I also did Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred. I enjoyed the strength training she incorporated, and moving forward I'd like to focus on building my upper body strength. I signed up for a climbing gym membership this month.

I also take long walks on the weekend, and occasionally I'll go for a 2-3 mile run.

I also dieted. I used the MyFitnessPal app to track my calories. At first it was really tedious to track everything I consumed, but it was a really great guide. Without tracking my calories, I would not have lost the weight I did. I didn't realize how much I was overeating (especially in booze)—I didn't consume a lot of junk food, but my portions were way too big. 

I set a goal of 1 lb loss per week, which was surprisingly maintainable for me. I eat less meat now, and I rarely have red meat or pork. I don't go for fried food often. This Thanksgiving, I realized that my stomach gets full a lot quicker now. I am accustomed to smaller, healthier portions.

I am happy with my new body, but I need to replace/alter a lot of my clothing. Most importantly, I am proud of what my body can do.

Future goals? I'd like to sign up for a 5K run soonish and do AIDS Life Cycle in 2014.

I have been attending my university's gym for the four years I've been here. For the first three years, I never had any problems. I never had any problems because for these three years, I have stuck to the track a cardio machines.

For the past few months, I have been spending more time in the weight room. I love it. I love that I can squat more than I weigh. I love that my biceps are bigger. I LOVE seeing myself make progress, and I love pushing myself as far as I can even more.

I have noticed however, that some guys at my gym aren't super stoked on having to share the weight room with someone who owns a vagina. If I go in the morning, everyone is super friendly and is just interested in getting their work out done, so I haven't had any problems then. During this time of the day I sometimes see one or two other girls, which is encouraging. For the last few weeks, every time I go to the weight room in the afternoon or night, someone in a fraternity shirt has to comment. I have only ever seen one other girl in the weight room at night, and she is a sexy she-hulk that guys are obviously very intimidated by. (I sort of secretly wish she was my BFF. I could be her side kick, and we could fight misogyny everywhere!) 

The first time, I was doing bench presses. Sure, I was only benching the bar, but everyone has to start somewhere, not to mention I had never bench pressed anything a week earlier. Some guy comes up and says ""Shouldn't you be in the dumbbell section?"" Maybe its because I was having a shitty day, or really just because I'm not as much as a lady as I think I am, but I told him to fuck off.

About a week later, I'm squatting. As I have 120 pounds on my shoulders, a guy comes up behind me and lifts the bar off of me. I ask him what he's doing and he said I ""looked like I needed help."" Alright, so maybe he really thought I wasn't capable of finishing the rep, and was just trying to be nice. But still, I feel like if I had been a dude squatting, he wouldn't have ""helped"" me. I told him I was fine and started my set again.

Last Tuesday I was once again squatting. I set the bar back down, and instantly a guy comes and starts taking weights off of it. I tell him I'm not done yet and he looks sort of offended. ""I'm just trying to speed things up."" What the hell does that mean? I had been using the bar for maybe five minutes. I add more weight and he leaves.


EDIT: Alright, so it seems the consensus is just to continue telling guys that disrupt my workout to fuck off. It was this response that I have been itching to give, but didn't know if I was over reacting or being and utter bitch. Thank you.
I guess what I'm asking is, has this kind of stuff ever happened to you, and what do you do to combat it/how do you respond? I have been pretty nice about it so far (other than the first incident) but I have a feeling if it happens again I might let my mouth fly.

This worked for a while, but it wasn't what I really wanted. I *really, really* wanted to touch a barbell. But I was so scared to venture out. Terrified.

Then I posted here a few days ago about being worn down and hungry all the time. That's when I got the validation I needed to hear: STOP cutting and start lifting (I'm eating more now, too!). I secretly knew this is what I needed to do for a while now, but I had been ignoring it.

So I told my sister (my gym partner) about my real urge to join the weight room and to my surprise, she was just as interested as I was to learn. She promised that if we looked like fools, at least we'd look like it together. 

And...we definitely did at first (pleasestopstaringeveryone oh god why) but I made myself get in the squat rack and go for it, and when my sister started getting really discouraged/feeling weak, I asked her to try one, *just one*, and go from there next time.

It was worth it- she was super excited afterwards and thanked me for encouraging her, and I'm just happy I'm finally progressing.

All of my weight is carried in my lower hips and especially in my upper thighs, while relatively little is stored in my upper hips/waist area. This creates the look of what I refer to as a [""hip dip""](http://imgur.com/NUDz5NN). 

For a very long time, I was extremely self-conscious about this. In high school I remember I drew a nude woman based on myself (hey, they don't let teens into nude figure drawing sessions) for an AP art class and during critique, all the other girls wanted to know why ""her hips looked wrong."" Needless to say, it made me feel like some sort of 1 in a million freak (sob story over).

Anyway, after many years of maturing, I've come to accept the hip dip, but I still don't like it. I've come to terms with the fact that losing weight doesn't make it go away, it's a phenomena of my bone structure and genetics. However, I AM wondering if for all these years I've been approaching this the wrong way. Rather than trying to diet hip dip away (which has only made it more prominent), maybe I should be trying to fill it in with muscle? 

Does anyone else in here have this hip structure? Do you know of any weight bearing exercises that help build up muscle in that area? Should I just give up and accept my child bearing hips?

TL/DR: Hip dip. Can I get rid of it by building muscle between my upper and lower hip bones?

EDIT: Perhaps I should also specify, I have a 32 inch upper hip and a 41 inch lower hip/upper thigh region, so for me the dip is much more pronounced than the picture indicates (I just grabbed something off Google).

I've seen a couple people just starting out on New Rules of Lifting for Women, and since I finished the first stage last week I figured I'd share my progress :)

I'm 23, 5'8"", currently 144lbs, and I started NROLW after losing 30 pounds in 4 months of pure cardio/caloric restriction. At the end of losing all that weight, I just felt weak- certainly better than I did at my start weight of 170, but I wasn't the fit person full of energy that I had imaged when I set out to lose the weight. Cue lifting!

Within a week of starting to lift heavy things, I could already feel a difference in my body. I was constantly sore and everything hurt, but that diminished as I kept at it. It was addicting being able to lift more and more each week, and lifting honestly just made me feel like a badass!

My progress on the lifts of the program was...

* Squats: 18lb body bar -&gt; 145lbs
* Deadlifts: Empty bar -&gt; 145lbs
* Lat pull downs: 40lbs -&gt; 80lbs
* Seated rows: 30lbs -&gt; 80lbs
* Dumbbell overhead presses: 25lbs (12.5 in each hand) -&gt; 50 lbs (25 each)
* Push-Ups: 10 standard -&gt; 15 T push-ups with 10lb weights (At the top of the push-up, you lift one arm holding on to a dumbbell up in the air, forming a T with your body... sorry I'm terrible at describing this!!)
* Lunges: 30lbs -&gt; 50lbs (25lb dumbbell in each hand)
* Step ups: 30lbs (low step) -&gt; 50lbs (high step, 25lb dumbbell in each hand)

Andddd the good part: [Pictures! NSFW](http://imgur.com/a/7O82S)

The first picture is at 170lbs before I started losing weight. The second picture is after I had lost 30lbs through cardio/calorie counting. The third picture is me currently, I've actually gained 4 pounds but I think I can see a positive difference in my body- my stomach looks flatter, and I think my butt looks tighter too. Even though my thighs look ""bigger"", I can promise you that they are SO much more firm and muscular.

The last few pictures are bonus pictures- I don't have any to compare with from before, but I am so so happy with how my arms and back look now. I had no muscle definition and was all squishy fat before I started lifting- that has changed considerably!

Nutrition has been hard for me- after spending so long cutting down to a silly amount of calories (1200-1500 a day, not considering that I have an active job on my feet all day and would do cardio on top of that), I was scared to eat more to support my lifting. I actually don't count calories anymore because it was just too stressful for me, and instead I just try to be very mindful of my body's needs. I eat a lot of fruit and veggies, but I'm not shy around the peanut butter or almonds or greek yogurt either! I try to get most of my protein through lean meats, but I do have a protein shake on lifting days because I find it really helps my recovery. Every week, I buy one thing at the grocery store that isn't ""ideal"" and I enjoy every bite of it- this week it's a box of girl scout cookies! I also generally have a ""cheat"" meal over the weekend. This keeps me sane.

So that's my progress so far! I plan to keep on lifting because I like what it's doing for my body :) Thank you so much for your support ladies, without you I wouldn't have found the courage to start this journey!",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_1czich,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1czich/wanted_to_share_some_progress_stage_1_of_nrolw/,

Very much. So I always put off doing it **as long as possible**. And ""doing laundry"" for me means dropping it off at the wash dry fold place, since that only ends up costing $2 more per load than my outrageously overpriced building washer and dryer. Plus, they fold way better than I can.

So because I always put off doing my laundry forever and ever, I always have a *ton*. On average, about 35lb at a time. And I live on the top floor. And I navigate some pretty treacherous, steep, rickety stairs ([here's a picture](http://i.imgur.com/1u9rewv.jpg) -- I live even a bit up from where this picture is taken!) that are scary and tiring first thing in the morning when I've just eaten a protein bar and downed an energy drink, let alone after a long day of work and carrying a bunch of stuff.

So it usually takes me two trips, both to bring my laundry down and to haul it back up. Sometimes, hauling it upstairs takes me three trips.

But I've been working out since November, regularly, and I started doing some moderate strength training at the beginning of January (Body Pump and TRX classes).

Hi all,

So there's been a bit of talk about the sub getting overly, well, picture-y. I've thought up three different ways we can go on this, and I'd like everyone to **please leave a comment saying which option you prefer and why:**

**A.** Mods remove all threads that are purely based on pictures (i.e. ""Wow look how far my [insert body part] has come along!"") and leave a comment instructing OP to post in the weekly thread instead.

**B.**  We disable link/image posts altogether. Only text-based posts will be allowed, but we will not remove text-based posts with progress pics (as long as they talk a bit about their routine, diet, etc.). Posts which are still just ""Check out my [insert body part]"" would be removed and directed to the weekly thread.

**C.** We leave things as they are.

It's also been brought up that the name of the Sunday pic thread (""Sunderwear Day"") may not be the best, so any suggestions for another name (or perhaps moving it to Wednesday - ""Where-you're-at Wednesday""?) are welcome.

**Also**, and this might be getting a bit too restrictive for you, but I had the idea that we put something in the sidebar (or even make it a rule) that disparaging comments about one's own photos shouldn't be allowed. It was pointed out that some people who are posting about their progress make a habit of disparaging their 'before' photo, when often that before photo is a goal of others reading this sub, or is a very healthy body. 

**The last thing we want is for this to become a sub just about being lean. This place is about fitness as a whole: what our bodies can *do*, not just what they look like.**

Obviously, we all love and celebrate each other's successes of any sort - however it's important that in doing so, we don't alienate women who are a different size/shape, or who are at different stages of fitness, or who don't aspire to the lean aesthetic. 

**EDIT:** Since some have asked - I will be counting comments *only*, not upvotes/downvotes. This is to avoid 'doubling up' where people just upvote everyone who agrees with them. If people say ""A or B"" or ""B or C"", I will count that as 1 for each of those things.

Just a quick reminder that for those of us in the northern hemisphere summer is approaching which means now is a good time to start protecting yourself against melanoma.

As someone basically counting down the days until I have to get some sort of skin cancer removed (thanks Scandinavian forebearers) I have become vigilant against sun damage. 

Many of you will be exercising outdoors more than you were over the past 6 months and generally outdoors in the sun more. Wear sunscreen every day and go out and buy new stuff, not the same bottle you've had in your bathroom for the last 3 years. The chemical compounds that help to protect you from UV-A and UV-B do breakdown over time reducing their effectiveness. Even if you're just sitting at your desk all day, if you are sitting next to a window put it on in the morning. Use at least SPF30 and reapply; particularly make sure you reapply before you go out for your run/swim/bike ride/hike, etc. Wear sunglasses that protect against UV-A and UV-B when you're out and consider wearing a hat if you're out for a really long time. While this is perhaps most obvious to those with a fairer complexion, folks with darker skin are also at risk, so everyone protect yourselves while you're out enjoying the lovely weather.",CONVERSATION,False,,t5_2ryzy,1367844744.0,,running,True,t3_1ds8nn,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1ds8nn/summer_sun_reminder/,

He knows her as sensible, but she’s going without her favorite shoes because she spent $200 on anti-wrinkle cream and another $200 on appetite suppressant/fat burners “guaranteed’ to work. He knows her as fun and engaging, but she won’t go with him to the coast this weekend till that “cleanse” is over and works as promised and she can fit in her spring dress. He knows her to be hospitable, but her diet compelled her to ‘rudely’ refuse a piece of birthday cake to celebrate a dear friend’s birthday – only to later that day binge alone on all the food left over from the party. He knows the woman she ‘could’ be, the woman she ‘wants’ to be - because that is who she lets him see. – But she ‘lives’ the woman she allows herself to be. And if he does find the insight to see her battle, he can’t help. There is no rationality to an irrational struggle. Everything he says is wrong. Everything he says just seems to hurt her more. If he says none of this stuff matters – well then it proves he doesn’t understand – and who is he to trivialize her struggle with her demons. That doesn’t comfort her. But if he agrees with her that the issue is serious – well that makes it worse, because now it must be ‘so’ obvious. She interprets and filters his attempts at comfort through her battle’s emotional defenses. How could he possibly love her – he ‘must’ think she’s fat, and ugly, and now, getting older too. But if he says he loves her just the way she is – well that only reinforces that she is ALL these things she’s feared and been battling against. That statement only proves he couldn’t think she’s beautiful. But if he tells her she is ‘beautiful’ well that is worse of all – because how can she be something she can’t feel. And now she feels alone and isolated – and can’t talk about this with anyone. All the things she rationally would want to hear for her own comfort – she filters through the battle – and the words just ring hollow now – and she feels unloved and alone.

Anyway, I've been seeing a personal trainer since August 20 and going to the gym regularly and doing some home workouts too.  Since joining the gym and seeing my PT twice a week I wasn't doing a whole lot at home, and only just started getting back on my treadmill now that it's too cold to be outside. (NOTE: I only use the treadmill to do interval running as a warm up to my weight lifting).

When I plugged the treadmill in the computer had saved all my information.  I had to adjust my weight for what felt like forever to go from 223 to 185 (at that time, I'm now at 180) and I looked at my last go on the machine.  Now, mind you, I knew from using the treadmill at the gym and at the PT's place that I was making improvements, but I thought maybe my treadmill was different and ran faster or something.

Anyway, when I was at 223 lbs these were my numbers:

Walk: 2.6 mph
Fast walk: 2.8 mph
Jog: 3 mph
Fast jog: 3.2 mph
Holy-crap-I'm-going-to-fall-off-this-damn-machine run: 3.4 mph.

Now at 180 (again, I was 185 when I started to use my treadmill again) my numbers are:

walk: 3 mph
Fast walk: 4 mph
Run: 6 - 6.5 mph (depends on the time of day and how much activity I was doing prior to my work out)
Fast jog: 7 - 7.5 mph
Holy-crap-I'm-going-to-fall-off-this-damn-machine run: 8 mph.

What I accomplished in 30 days:

* Day 1 I couldn't do down dog (my knees had to be bent, and on my toes [like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=rbJaj0Aqw5k#t=20s) ) and now I can do full down dog with feet flat on the floor.  

* Day 1 I could barely touch my toes standing up and now I can put my hands flat on the floor in front of me.  

* Day 1 I had to modify a lot of things because my wrists weren't flexible enough for my arms to be under me in plank position, and now I have much less pain in my wrists.

* My back, shoulders and neck hurt a lot less now when I play cello.

Overall I am so incredibly happy I did the 30 days challenge, and you know what, I've continued to do it every day even though the challenge ended!  I look forward to it every day and I always feel better after even a short yoga session.

It was always that her thighs were fat, she needed to lose weight, she hates her gut, etc.  Her mother was the same way, placing an extensive amount of importance on outward appearance and hating yourself.

I am not sure if this is related, but I suffered from a lot of body dysmorphia in college (vomiting as many as 5 times a day while subsisting on a 900 calorie diet).  I never sought help, because I was afraid I wouldn't receive support (emotional or otherwise) from my mother, since the only time she ever complimented my body was when I was 2 lbs away from qualifying as clinically anorexic.  To this day, I'm a little confused how I managed to escape from my unhealthy behavior, but that is besides the point.

A year and a half ago, my boyfriend (now fiance) took me to the gym and taught me how to lift.  I really love it.  While I have put on about 15 lbs since then (the heaviest I have ever been), my body image is almost unbelievably positive.  Sure, my guns don't fit into a lot of my old clothes.  My mother refuses to let me donate or get rid of any of them, just in case ""I get skinny again.""  I usually just ignored it, because I love my body and my strength.  And, of course, she hated that I expressed interest in physique shows.

Today, I had an AMAZING workout.  PRed deadlift (250) and squat (200), even though I'm in the midst of shark week.  After talking with an acquaintance at my gym, he suggested that I try power lifting competitively.   I'm not sure if I will, but I found it immensely flattering.  When I got home, I briefly mentioned this, she freaked out and said I was going to end up looking like a man and a bunch of things about how I won't have time to do it and general body shaming stuff.  It was the last straw.  It was so hurtful.

I move cross country in 10 days, living with my parents between leases.  I can hardly handle all the body shaming and snide comments any more.  It's as if she's jealous or angry that I have a positive body image and maintain a healthy weight/lifestyle.  Sometimes I think she wants me to go back to hating my body like she does, and I just can't do that.

Has anyone had experience with people hating on your self confidence or, you know, not obsessing over every flaw you have?  I need some advice on how to deflect this (at least while I finish out my time in her house) or an internet hug (periods= crazy emotions)

I've been a long time lurker and just started the New Rules of Lifting for Women. I have to admit that I was a little intimidated to start lifting because I literally had no idea how to even start. I was also nervous because at my old gym there were NO women in the lifting area, just a bunch of jacked brahhhs with shaker cups. In fact, I often heard personal trainers insist women do more cardio and less/lighter weights!  

So, after getting seriously fed up with cardio and going through 3 rounds of the 30 day shred, I decided I needed a new gym and new plan! I had to ask a male personal trainer to help me set up my first deadlift and I was nervous he'd send me to the machines or tell me to get a 5 pound weight. Instead, the dude looked at me and said ""You want to do freeweights? Awesome! I think the bar will be too light, let's start off with 70 pounds"". Fuck yes!

So I've been working out for almost a year now, and have seen a great improval in terms of stamina, strength, etc. My body has changed and I fucking loved watching muscles make their appearance and feeling progressively stronger.

As a result I've been reading this sub a lot and others like /r/fitness or /r/progresspics /r/running, etc.
Lately I've watched a lot of progress pics cause I find them really inspiring. Also reading about abs, which are made in the kitchen, etc.

And just like that, because of all of these pics of really skinny girls with perfect abs, and because I now know it's possible to have this body if you put in enough work, I started thinking I was fat.
I'm not, really. I carry a little fat around the hips but really not a lot. And even if I was, I shouldn't care that much. Cause I've never ever been self-conscious about my weight, even when I was bigger. I feel like watching my body change made me lose the confidence I had in it. I don't understand it cause I'm doing something so empowering and amazing and at the same time it leaves me in that state of ""I'm not doing enough, my body isn't perfect I need to improve it"".

So my question is, how do you ladies find the balance between 1- having a goal and working to change your body into something you want it to be, and 2- still being able to love your body for what it is, and not being constantly worrying about being too fat, not strong enough, etc.

I'd love your input on this, cause I'm finding it really difficult to find a balance between the two.



**EDIT:**

Thank you so much for these answers. I went to bed last night (european) after writing this and didn't expect to have that many answers this morning.
I think clarifications are needed about my goals: my main goals are to run faster and do more reps of strength exercises. The ""looking better"" thing comes after. What worried me was the fact that I felt I've shifted my priorities, going from a ""I'm so strong and I love how my body is improving week after week"" attitude  to a ""I'm not strong enough, not fit enough, if I was I'd be slim like those girls"" attitude. I might have to add that I'm struggling with anxiety right now so that might explain my new found insecurity.


Thank you SO MUCH for putting things into perspective. I thought that I might not be the only one struggling with these kind of dilemmas. It's a relief knowing I'm not alone in this. Your words are very inspirational to me. 
Anyway, thanks again, I'll come back and read this everytime I'm feeling down about myself :)

To me, muscle shaming is when another person says something to undermine your hard work and make you feel bad or guilty about being muscular, defined, fit or for just setting foot in the gym.

I've experienced this twice in 24 hours and it has really riled me!

Last night I went to the gym and indulged in a really intense core and abs workout. I was finishing up with 30 minutes of cardio and this amazing lady walked in. I'm not sure if she was a competitive bodybuilder, but she certainly had the figure for it (*pun fully intended*). Her body was just fantastic and you could tell she'd dedicated a lot of time, energy and motivation to getting into shape and staying that way. I was honestly in awe! She hopped on to the cross-trainer to my right and I heard the two bros on my left start talking about her, one of them even going as far as saying ""she looks disgusting, fucking lesbian."" I was in absolute shock! In my eyes, she didn't look disgusting at all and her sexuality has nothing to do with it! I gave them a filthy look, but was too speechless (and breathless) to voice my utter frustration at what they had said. I should've stuck up for her and given them a piece of my mind, but I didn't, because I was a coward. I feel terrible about not saying anything, and wish I could let that lady know that I actually think she's phenomenal. 

So I left the gym, feeling guilty and offended on behalf of the fit, healthy and happy woman next to me. I'm pretty sure she didn't hear what they said, but these ignorant people need to realise they can't get away with that kind of stuff, whether the person you're talking about can hear it or not.

This morning, I woke up and the second bout of muscle shaming occured. I'd added a friend-of-a-friend on Facebook and I'd noticed that his wall mostly contained posts about working out, lifting weights, wrestling and bodybuilding. I'd sent him a message asking him about his training and in only his second message to me, he wrote the words: ""I actually find it really unattractive that you know so much about lifting."" Wow. Just wow. Now I know muscular/fit women aren't to everyones tastes, but YOU requested my friendship and now you're being a dick because I have an interest in something that YOU don't consider appropriate for a woman to know about? I simply replied with ""If a woman being knowledgable about weightlifting intimidates you then you must live a very sad and shallow existence."" Then I blocked and deleted him.

This happened before I went to work and it made me so annoyed! This, on top of what had happened in the gym, just made me realise that people can be so rude, ignorant, judgemental and down-right offensive about women who are fit or trying to get fit. 

I let myself seethe for a while and then I decided to do something positive instead. I've promised myself that the next time I'm in the gym and the lady is there, I'm going to let her know that I admire her and ask her if she'd be interested in training together some time. I've also made a promise to myself that I will **not** let other people get away with muscle shaming. It is just as bad as bullying someone for any other aspect of their appearence. Finally, I've decided to work out even harder! I will not let idiots and their ill-informed opinions deter me from achieving the body I want, whether it is to their liking or not.

Ladies, please don't stand for muscle shaming. Don't put yourself in a dangerous position by calling someone out on it, but if it is safe and appropriate to do so, please let the person doing the shaming know that what they are doing is wrong.

**TL;DR**: Fit woman in the gym gets insulted by douchebags. Then I get insulted by an epic asshat for having an interest in bodybuilding. Then I decide to start kicking ass and taking names, and not let people get away with muscle shaming.

I was a competitive dancer in my adolescence which kept me in decent shape, and stuck with a personal trainer and sports in high school which got me into the best shape I've ever been in.

But when I started college I gave it all up to focus on my studies, and put on about 100lb in around only 18 months. It sucked. A LOT.

I graduated from high school, junior college, and with a dual degree from university in the few years that followed, and I didn't make a point of keeping any photos of those milestones. While I can accept that my priorities were what they were and for good reason, I just got embarrassed by how quickly I ""let myself go."" 

I've come to terms with my weight by now and have gotten healthier (though not lighter) in the past couple of years. I'd hit the gym occasionally and usually walk to work and school. I'm dressing better for my size rather than looking like crap in denial, and the improvement to my self confidence has helped motivate me to do better with what I eat and make time to do activities that make me happy and healthy.

**This June I will be finishing my Master's degree, and I want to keep these photos.**

I decided tonight that I wanted to shoot for a 60 minute ""run"" on the elliptical rather than my usual 30. I geared up, took my allergy and asthma meds, filled the water bottle, and got Pandora spinning.

I put in my weight, I put in the 60 minute duration, and then I even chose a varied elevation cross country course over my usual flat routine. Off I went, and to my own surprise I kind of kicked its ass :) I did more work in the first 35 minutes of my work out than I normally do in a 30+5, and managed to keep going through the entire thing albeit a bit slower towards the end.

I got home from the gym an hour ago and haven't gotten up off my couch since I sat on it, and as sweaty as I am and as much soreness and stiffness are already setting in to my legs, I feel pretty damn good.

Also my happy face!,cAtdraco,79,10,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1jsjjw/nsv_deadlift_5x100kg_also_my_happy_face/,"So after participating in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1jnr65/am_i_the_only_person_who_sees_a_problem_with_this/), I thought I might make a post about my latest achievement.

I see myself as an intermediate lifter. I've been lifting long enough and heavy enough that I don't feel like a beginner any more, and my programming is significantly different than when I started in terms of rep ranges, splits, and frequency. But I still haven't been lifting very long (only about 6 months), and my numbers are decent but not exceptional.

So I hit a big milestone yesterday. I deadlifted 5x100kg. I first lifted 100kg about four weeks ago - one very slow rep that left me feeling exhilarated. I literally danced around the gym. I first pulled three reps three weeks ago, and I danced again. Yesterday, I was trying for four - and I got five out. [I laughed at the top of the last rep, it felt so good.](http://imgur.com/xqIBE1K)

So that's my big achievement for the week. My next deadlift goal is to hit 120kg (just 1 rep to start with). 120kg will be 1.5x my body weight. :)

**EDIT: As requested, more details about my training:**

For context, I'm 171cm and 80kg (around 5'7"" and 175lb, near enough).

I started lifting in February with a personal trainer, which means I started deadlifting some time in March I think. He started me on a simple program with mostly cable machines - I know we all hate them here, but in retrospect I see what he was doing and it turned out to be a good approach for me. I went in there with hypermobile joints and very low muscle tone particularly in my shoulders (I could pop my shoulder out of joint and tear my rotator cuff *while sleeping*, seriously). I couldn't do a single body weight squat when he first tested me in February! Seriously underdeveloped glutes. He moved me off the machines and onto free weights as soon as he felt I had enough strength to learn movements without injuring myself.

I started out with two personal training sessions each week, and I'd go in to the gym a couple of times on my own - once to do my resistance program, and once to do a cardio day with some core exercises.

Things have changed a bit since then!

I'm currently training 5-6 days a week. I try for 6, but the realities of work and family mean that more often than not I only get in 5 times. I work with a personal trainer, and I have two sessions with him each week, and aim for four more on my own.

When I work with him, the program varies - generally we have a more cardio-based session (mostly boxing), and the other session at the moment is a volume session based on a four way split. We just did legs, the week before that was back, and before that was shoulders. That cardio is pretty much the only cardio I do at the moment - and I do it mostly because a little bit of cardio is good for my lifting. But only a little bit. ;)

My four solo sessions are based on an upper/lower split, each done twice. The upper routine involves bench, deadlifts, dumbbell shoulder presses, bench pull, and supersets of cable hammer curls and overhead tricep extensions. The lower routine is basically squat day - back squats, leg press, front squats, leg curls, and goblet squats. ALL OF THE SQUATS. It's intense, but I love it. Rep ranges vary from 4-10 depending on the exercise - I aim for 4 rep work sets on bench, deadlift, and back squats, with at least 3-4 minutes between sets. Leg press is 6 reps, with 2-3 minute rests. Everything else is 10, with only 1-2 minute rests between sets. Lately I've also thrown in some volume work on bench days after my work sets - been doing 10x10 at 60%, because my bench sucks compared to my other lifts. Seems to be working - my 1RM has jumped 5kg in 3 weeks, which is much faster progress than I've managed previously.

My trainer works in six week increments, and he's already indicated that my next program will involve a four way split. Chest/tri, back/bi, shoulder, leg. For each six week program, we set goals, and mine are purely strength based.

Right now (as of this week) a typical leg day would end up with work sets that look like this:

* Back squats: 2x4 at 75kg, plus 1-2 reps at 80kg, whatever I can squeeze out
* Leg press: 3x6 at 240kg (that is not a typo! I own that machine.)
* Front squats: 3x10 at 40kg
* Leg curls: 3x10 at 40kg, 35kg if I'm tired
* Goblet squats: 3x10 at 32kg (kettlebell, they come in ridiculous weights don't they?)

A typical upper body day would end up with work sets that look a bit like this:

* Bench: 2x4 at 40kg, plus whatever I can squeeze out at 42.5kg or (as of this week) 45kg
* Deadlifts: 2x4 at 100kg
* Dumbbell shoulder press: 3x10 at 10kg (each hand, so 20kg in total)
* Bench pull: 3x10 at 20kg
* Hammer curls/OH tricep extensions SS 3x10 at 12.5kg, more or less

I'm currently bulking - eating pretty much whatever I like, and trying to get more calories in general. With my appetite and level of activity, overeating is not an issue. The more I eat, the more muscle I build, and I'm still quietly losing body fat. I'm seeing gradually increasing vascularity and some more prominent bones, though the scales are creeping up. I have my body fat measured with calipers every 6 weeks, and I have been losing about 1% fat each time.

",crapshack,77,3,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/19s6y7/xxfitness_i_am_29_years_old_today_i_want_to_feel/,"Hi ladies, this is a bit of an introduction post, I hope that's allowed.  I'm going to try and keep it short, but I have some things I want to put out into the universe.  

My 20's were shit, for various reasons.  Recently I've gotten my act together.  Unfortunately, as a result of having a full-time desk job, man who loves me (and cheese, lol), and not taking care of myself, I've gotten soft and overweight.  

I've always been kind of big, but it wasn't until I started working full time sitting on my butt - a kind of job I've never had before - my health has really deteriorated.  I've been diagnosed with asthma, tore my ACL in a mosh pit, and have managed to balloon up to 215 lbs.  I'm 5'7"", and my hips measure 50"" around.  I get winded so easily. 

I hope this isn't a fleeting feeling, but this week I've decided that I'm going to start taking care of myself. Not for any man (I think mine would love me if I had two heads anyhow), not for fashion, not for bikini season, not for money, and not for pride, but because I want my whole self to be healthy and feel good. It's a foreign concept for me - to do something simply to take care of myself, with no external motivation, but I am hopeful that this time, things will be different. 

I refuse to go into my 30's overweight, injured, stressed out, and asthmatic.  I've made a commitment to myself to do a fitnessblender video on youtube every day.  If I'm super tired, even just a 5 minute ab workout, or stretching exercises.  Yesterday I tried a 22 minute ""recovery"" low impact cardio work out and could only get to 16 minutes.  It felt so good though.  Finishing that video is my mini goal for now.  I don't even care what the scale says, I just want to feel better.  

I've been subbed here pretty well since I've joined reddit, and I'm going to make an effort to be inspired by your posts, rather than self-loathing.

1374765115.0,71,self.xxfitness,1j14n2,[NSV] Me and my Frankenbelly,square--one,78,7,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1j14n2/nsv_me_and_my_frankenbelly/,"I originally posted this as a comment in a post I made in /r/gore, of all places. Looking back at it, it's not the usual kind of progress story, but it's one that I am proud of.


Two weeks ago I was at work minding my own business when suddenly I felt a cramping pain in my guts. Most people would assume this was food poisoning but I knew that this was the feeling of a blocked small intestine. This had happened to me once before...it took over 24 hours of cramping pain and being diagnosed wrongly with appendicitis and gallstones before someone figured out what was up - scar tissue from an operation to remove ovarian cancer tumours from 2 years ago had gotten all up in my business and was strangling my guts. Nothing got through, including gas, and I couldn't eat, drink or poop for the 2 weeks it took in hospital to get sorted out. But back in May it did sort itself out and I went on my merry way. Now I had it again.


After a week in hospital nothing was changing in the slightest. The non-surgical route wasn't going to work this time and now a second operation to fix me was my only hope. So I went back under the knife.  


[This photo album shows my scar at different times [NSFW]](http://imgur.com/a/fOJra). I wasn't in shape at all before I got the first scar. You can see in the second picture in this album I posted. I was bloated and stretch marked, I weighed 183lb at my heaviest and I had very little lean mass. I don't hesitate to say I was and still am proud of my body at that time all the same - it had done a decent job of pulling through 4 rounds of chemo and now a 9 hour surgery and I was just happy to be alive and have all my inside bits still on the inside (before the op I was terrified of waking up to find I had a colostomy bag).


It took 11 days to recover from the first operation enough to leave hospital. I was only unable to eat from the date of surgery until about 4 days later when my digestive system kicked back in again. I took 4 days to stand up without help from physio, at least a week before I was walking with a zimmer frame and left the hospital using a cane for support.


After that first surgery I decided to get fit. I started with pilates and swimming and then did the Couch to 5k. I switched to astanga yoga and after discovering places like /r/fitness and this subreddit, I started to strength train following Stronglifts 5x5 and trying to build up to full push ups and unassisted chin ups. This summer I ran my first proper 5k and I was riding my bike 16 miles every day to get to work, 5 days a week.


As a result, the second time round having surgery I recovered so much faster. I starved for a week before going under the knife because again the scar tissue blocked anything from passing through, even water or gas. I had to have IV fluids. 3 days afterwards I got myself out of bed with no assistance. The next day I was able to walk unaided and have a shower by myself. I was out of hospital 6 days after I was operated on and yesterday (day 7) I took my dog on a 10 minute walk.


I lost 13lb during the past 2 weeks bringing my total weight loss in 2 years down to around 45lb. This is not good weight loss! I inevitably lost muscle during this time because I was starving but at least the extra muscle I had on me means that I am now a much smaller 138lb person than I was the last time I was this weight (when I was 14!). Despite the fact my belly is swollen right now from the surgery.


I am 100% determined to get my strength back as soon as possible, to replace the muscle I lost. I'm going to start yoga again when I hit the 2 week mark, and get running again at the 4 week mark. I fully intend on going camping in a couple of weeks and I want to finish off my internship next week as well. When I go back to uni I'm hitting the gym (yay for free gym!). For major abdominal surgery, I'm not doing too bad! The experience I've had is exactly why fitness is so important, it gives your body the ability to put up a good fight and I know that it will always be a part of my life from now on.


Also when I can swim again nothing is going to stop me from breaking out the bikini, because I am proud of my Frankenbelly!

I'm not new to fitness, but I am new to weight lifting and serious fitness.  I've been semi-active for about 3 years, learned how to run way back in 1999 but stopped when life got hectic and I got lazy.  My weight has fluctuated to 174 at its lowest and a staggering 265 at its peak.  This time around I started at 223 and I'm now down to 191 by dieting and exercising.

Joined a gym about 8 weeks ago and got a personal trainer 4 weeks ago.  My personal trainer is great, he's motivating, inspirational, and always makes me feel like there is room for improvement.  One of his main points is that you need to get out of your comfort zone because the action starts outside of it.  This has been going through my mind for a couple of weeks now, and when I'm working out with him I'm definitely pushed out of my comfort zone (or shoved however you want to look at it), but when I work out alone I seem to just step slightly out of my comfort zone.  Today I definitely jumped out of my comfort zone.

So my city is separated by a large hill.  I'd say on an average treadmill it's about a 12 - 15 percent incline.  I've been climbing this beast of a hill for 3 years but always walked up it.  Today I had my personal trainer's voice in my head that said ""do you want results or do you want results quickly?""  So for parts of that hill (takes me about 15 - 20 minutes to walk it) I ran.  I actually RAN.  Fat, 191 pound, short legged Sarah actually ran for parts of that hill!  Butt jiggling as car drove past, face red and sweaty, felt like I was going to puke after each burst of energy RAN up that hill!  Then I came back to my office and there's a set of stairs that run up the side of a hill that I normally climb 10 times.  Every odd climb I ran up those stairs.  

I'm a bit proud of myself today.  I don't normally run in public because I hate for people to see all my fat rolling around like a bowl full of jelly, but today I didn't care.  Today I pushed myself more than I ever have in the past while working out alone.  My new goal is in the summer of 2013 I run up that entire hill non-stop!  It will be challenging since I can't run up it in the winter time (too damn cold here) but I can train on the treadmill, and I will attain my goal!

I was a captain on the school wrestling team (for boys) and had torn my meniscus during a match. I always had knee problems, but was told it was growing pains repeatedly throughout my life. My knees would swell and ache so bad I had to stop what I was doing on most days. The tear in my meniscus led to the discovery of my flat feet. Because my feet fell inward, my muscles pulled on my joints in a weird way and the tear was a result. My doctor told me my lifting days were over and I never should've been doing high impact activities, such as wrestling, judo, or lifting. These were activities which dominated my life at the time and I loved every minute of each of them.

Fast forward four years. While I had gained only a small amount of weight, my muscles had become gelatinous. I was still petite, but now curvy (and not in all the right places). I was seriously depressed and here I was on Reddit giving other people advice about being comfortable with your body and going to the gym to improve self-image. I was living a lie. A few months ago I had a breakdown and decided that was it, I had to end the lies. Doctor be damned, I wasn't going to wallow in misery any more.

I drove straight to my dad's friend's house and got a membership to his scrappy little attic gym. It's a no frills kind of place with no restroom and not more than five members, including me. But, he had bought equipment from the gym my family owned (we had gone out of business when a chain moved into the area). It was equipment I knew and loved when I was lifting in high school.

Well, today I was curling and looked over and there they were: my beautiful biceps in all their glory. I almost have my triceps horseshoe back, my legs are gorgeous, and the back fat I was seeing under my shirt has been toned away. I've never been so in love with my body. And my boyfriend digs it, too. I still have curves, but now they're in all the right places.

You're a troupe of massively inspirational, badass ladies who help so many people, myself included, lose their fears and inhibitions toward fitness, weight-loss, and general gains in swoleness. You're a huge part of what keeps me going at this level.

PREFACE/BACKGROUND: It's been about 8 months into my lifestyle change. I've lost almost 30 lbs-- a lot on a 5'4"" frame. With that, I've become stronger and better able to last carrying heavier weights over longer periods of time.  Little did I know this would get me in trouble: 

Saturday, I was taking a bus to move home from college. I had shipped most of my stuff, but what remained were the heaviest/bulkiest items I figured I could manage myself in a rolling suitcase (some kitchen accoutrements, a bike lock, my boxing gear). The bag was very full, but I could get it down the stairs, down the street, and onto a city bus just fine.  I get to the bus stop and the baggage handler takes one look at my bag and asks me to step aside, as he thinks it might be too heavy.  He pulls out a handheld scale-- 79 lbs!!!!

Half of me panics because I might not be allowed on this bus due to the 50 lb weight limit, half of me is whooping and hollering my ""FUCK YEAH""s for making it to this point.  It ended up okay, as I just took an Amtrak instead, but I spent the afternoon feeling like a fucking amazon.

At the risk of someone figuring out who I am...

http://therelentlesstransformation.com/watch_live/go/melissa

SW: 130ish (the website says starting 127, but I actually started the Primal diet about 3 weeks before the first measurements were taken at the gym, and I think I was around 133 when I first changed my diet.) 
EW: 126
Lost approximately 3% body fat

I've always been a ""thin"" person (skinny fat?) and have done A LOT of cardio in the past, but never got into weights until I started a ""transformation"" program this past September with a local trainer. 

Diet-wise, for the past 3 or so years I was a vegetarian, so the transition to Primal eating (meaning Paleo plus some dairy, such as full fat greek yogurt, grass-fed butter, and occasionally cheese) was rough at first.  However, I feel great and I'm going to keep eating this way into the foreseeable future.  I was taking daily iron supplements before, but no longer need them.  I also lost all of the IBS-like digestion problems that I was having eating vegetarian (I was never diagnosed as gluten-intolerant, but I feel so much better not eating gluten that I have to question whether I am intolerant to some degree.) 

Work-out wise, I've been seeing my trainer 3x week for 45 minutes, learning various weight training exercises using body weight, TRX bands, kettlebells and free weights.  For perspective, I couldn't even do 1 ""real"" pushup when I started, and now I can do 10 in a row.  I also accomplished 2 full body-weight chin ups in a row!  The program is over now, and I can't afford to keep seeing my trainer that often, so I'm mostly on my own now (luckily my building has a pretty decent gym.)  I'm seriously considering starting Cross Fit in January.

I know that in comparison I'm a complete novice, but I think we always see and hear from women who are on the level of professional body building on here that I wanted to share some words of encouragement for the women who are just starting or who have been scared of trying it out. However, the thread which was originally meant to just share a happy moment turned into something suddenly intimidating and rather distracting for me personally.

I initially posted progress pictures because I have been so inspired by the ones I've seen on her in the past. I've gotten significantly stronger than I ever have and when I decided to finally document my progress, I found a three week old picture and was surprised by the difference and decided to juxtapose it for you to see. 

Correction: Yes, I have lost 4 inches around my waist but I think I need to clarify that I had been bulking for a month prior and was able to cut the inches pretty easily. In terms of weight gain, I had been 110 my entire college life and when I measured myself this past week, I noticed the drastic change of having gained 10 pounds for which I was really proud. 

I wasn't trying to brag, if that's how it came off. I have been made fun of in the past for having been underweight all my life, but it got particularly bad this past year. It really got to the core of me and made me feel disgusting. Wanting to become stronger and healthier, I went all out and dedicated every piece of my energy in my workouts and in gaining weight. 

Call me a wimp, but I guess I thought I could share my progress here because of the way this subreddit has been such a source of encouragement and positive energy. But I think I might have shared too soon because what should have been (and sometimes were) constructive criticisms led me feeling defensive about my recent gains and suddenly ashamed of it. 

Thank you to those of you who have been kind and constructive with your comments. I wish you all the best of luck as you continue building on your strengths and I hope that everyone can continue to share to the world that strong is beautiful.

I do four sets of 12 with just the barbell. I'm doing higher reps with whatever weight I can handle for the first few weeks so I can work on my form as per the advice of my old personal trainer who I love but i can't afford to see regularly anymore. 

Anyways, I'm doing my 11th rep of my 4th set and I fail and start to prepare for the roll of shame when this guy comes and helps me out.

He asks to see my workout plan and I show him what I had been doing. And then he says that it is too advanced. I should be doing dumbbells and machines for 3 - 4 months before I do barbells. That the 45lb bar was too heavy for me to lift and the movements I had planned were too advanced. He pointed out which machines I should be doing. Anyways, he made me feel like shit, but he ended off with a ""let me know if you need any help!"". So after this I moved on to do my Press, and then my deadlift but I could see him watching me between his sets. I'm not super confident about my power clean form so I ended up leaving the gym without doing my power cleans.

I don't know anyone else at my own gym (I used a guest pass at my friend's gym to do the form lessons), so I briefly interact with employees in passing and just go get to work. Because I usually come in on the same days at the same time, I'm used to who is working those hours. Today, while shaking out my legs a bit between sets of squats, one of the employees walked past and asked ""Getting ready to do another?"" I just smiled and said ""yep!"", to which he responded ""Keep it up! You're awesome!"" and continued on his business. I powered through that last set with gusto.

I'm trying to follow SS and I'm working in some running as well (C25K).

My family tells me I'm going to get too muscular, my friends don't get it at all, other people at the gym don't understand what a low bar squat is, my boyfriend criticizes my eating AND the program... I know I need to just ignore them, but it gets really hard when no one is there being supportive. 

I live with my boyfriend and all I ever hear about is that I'm eating too much and not doing enough cardio and not working my core enough... I just want to scream. He even laughs at me when I tell him how much I'm lifting (when he asks). He always says that he's proud of me for joining a gym, but then he turns around and doesn't support WHAT I do at the gym at all. He then says that I should join HIS gym where all of our coworkers go. Yeah, sounds great. Now I can be criticized MORE by the people I know.

I'm not just angry.. I'm tired. I'm so tired of defending myself. 

**Edit: Thanks so much, ladies. I knew I could count on you. I would like to clarify that my boyfriend isn't doing this menacingly. He was raised to be a very opinionated and confident person (even when he knows nothing about a subject). His personality tends to gravitate towards his Italian heritage, which isn't always easy to put up with. We're working on this together to help set boundaries between being witty and just plain rude. Also, the fact that I'm eating a lot and working out differently from any woman he has ever been with, I think, has been overwhelming. I've had major body issues in the past and he often worries that this type of behavior will have harmful side effects on me.  I guess my point is that he is a very caring, passionate person, but doesn't always communicate himself very well.**",,False,,t5_2ryzy,1365176709.0,,bench,True,t3_1bqf92,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1bqf92/ladies_im_getting_so_frustrated_please_help_me/,

I started getting serious about fitness last summer and have lost 38 lbs so far.  I am doing c25k right now (I'm on week 9) and do mostly high rep/low weight or body weight strength training on my non-running days.  My goal is to get to 129.2 lbs.  

As I've spent time exploring online fitness communities (like this one) I have really become impressed with results people get from lifting.  And I have a really flat butt that I really want to add serious mass to so I think that squats will be a necessity for me.  I do not want to be skinny fat...I don't even really want to be skinny.  I want to be fit and look fit.

For some reason, I have been apprehensive about starting lifting heavy until I get to my weight goal.  I guess I have been thinking that I should just focus on getting small and then worry about getting sculpted.  Also, I know that in order to perform well physically (both with lifting as well as other activities, like running) I can't be too restrictive with my calories.  This makes me nervous...I feel like if I eat more than 1200cal a day I will never get fit.  I know this is mostly just a mental thing. 

I know this is a bit of a nonsensical rant, but I just want to know what you ladies think.  Should I start lifting heavy now or is there reason to wait?

I have a gym membership and a workout buddy who is willing to start lifting with me (she is in similar physical condition).  So if I want to start lifting, there's nothing really getting in my way.

However every now and then I'd feel soreness or pain in my left hip for a few days after the workout. Also, my right side, which is my stronger side, kept wanting to fail on me on squats and it's very common for my right knee to cave on squats but my left leg was solid as a rock. It started to really hamper my progress so I finally made an appointment with a physical therapist.

Today I went in and had a great experience! I accidentally found a guy who spent a year working with Swedish top lifters and is very at home with problems lifters have. He asked me thorough questions, had me do a few movements while checking my hips and legs and then started adjusting the plethora of issues he found. Turns out I had a slightly misaligned pelvis, tightness in my right knee, some flexibility issues in the right calf due to tension and several other small things in my right side. He was very friendly, explained what he was doing, told me about how he lifts, etc. 

At the end of the session he gave me some pointers on how to train until I see him again (go for heavy short sets not lighter volume ones for my first workout, then try volume, then business as usual), said we still have some work with the knee and he'd like to see me again to figure out what is causing my issues (since there are a few possibilities).

Though I'm not magically 'healed' I'm very glad I found a knowledgeable physical therapist who seems to know what he's doing. Oh, and apparently I have hypermobile hips and knees and a freakishly high pain tolerance, so that's cool to know.

If any of you ladies have issues you've been putting off getting checked out I have to wholeheartedly recommend finding a physical therapist who's at home with heavy lifting or whatever sport you do and go to them! I'm really glad I did.

Which is why situations like this make me so hurt and angry.

I went out with a few of my girlfriends last night for some shopping and eating and gossiping and I started to realize, there is a lot of body shaming going on in our little group of women. 

There were a few, ""eugh, you're getting so/too skinny"", ""god, I wish I could eat that and lose weight"", ""I wish I had your genes"". It was funny at first but as the night progressed, it really started to piss me off.

Bitch! Please! I have worked too damn hard for you to tell me that my body is due to genetics. I have dragged my brown ass through 106F heat (dumb) and freezing rain when I wanted nothing more than to curl up and eat some red velvet cookie dough.

I put too much work into myself for you to tell me that the only reason I can eat this goddamned cheeseburger is because I scored in the genetic gene pool.

/rant

Sorry, had to get it out. I was pretty proud of my self control...I didn't punch anyone in the face. I was tactful in my response and waited until I got home to rant to my boyfriend about it (who then patted me on the head and was an absolute angel about it).

But this brings me to my question for anyone who has gone through a dramatic body transformation. How do you deal with friends or family who shame you for losing weight or getting fit? What do you do when they tell you that you're ""too skinny"" or ""genetically blessed""? 

I played the situation out in my head dozens of times and couldn't really come up with much that didn't minimize the amount of work I've put in or came off insulting. Those girls are generally good people and I still like them but all of the comments seriously upset me and I guess I just don't know how to deal with it or talk to them about it.

Thanks in advance!

Hey ladies, I'm swolesister. Some of you may have seen me posting around here before, or perhaps you've seen my [blog](http://www.swolesister.com). Just wanted to share this post with you that I wrote recently about some of the dangers of contest prep diets, and how I'm going about avoiding them as I prepare for my first ever figure competition!

Even though I might not be in the same situation as most women are with their bodies due to my strength training background, I think the message about changing your lifestyle vs. ""dieting"" might still find relevance with y'all. 

Also, if I can do it, so can you! I hope you'll follow me on my journey to the stage - so far it's been pretty fun!. Please feel free to follow me on [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/renee.dean.5623) and ask questions, too.

I had never used a weight machine or lifted a free weight. Running for more than five minutes consecutively was a real challenge. 

Now I work out five times a week, I have a regular strength training routine and have tripled my reps on almost every item, and I regularly run for 50 minutes at a time. I have dropped a dress size and for the first time since puberty I actually feel positive about my own body (hyperbolic but true). I am already fitter than I have ever been before in my life.

All of this feels amazing. But what actually feels the most wonderful of all is the knowledge that I delivered on a goal and did myself proud. I set myself a task to start getting fit and to improve as much as possible in ten weeks, and I actually achieved that without giving up or flaking out when it got hard. I have learned a lot about persistence and discipline, and that is an extremely valuable thing.

I can't wait to see where the next ten weeks take me (hopefully somewhere with more muscles). For now, I'm off to Italy for a week of wearing bikinis and shorts with confidence.

Reddit played a huge part in convincing me that I could start this in the first place, and in educating me along the way, so thank you to everyone who posts in fitness subreddits. And thank you for letting me make this rather self-indulgent post!

I'm studying psychology and exercise science in school and study nutrition on my own. I gained my freshman 15, met my current boyfriend (who is a saint and helped me learn the importance of my health), lost it, and feel better than I ever have in my life. 

One of my best friends on the other hand, has been gaining more weight each year. She constantly complains to me that she feels 'fat' and wishes she was lean and muscular like me. She asks me what to do and I tell her the same thing I tell everyone that asks my advice: start cutting back on soda/sweet tea, no 1am Jimmy John's trips, choose more veggies, start doing 30-60 mins of cardio 3x a week, weightlifting, etc etc. 

She tells me she can't do it, it's too hard, there must be a way to lose weight without giving up the foods she loves or spending more time at the gym. I desperately want to help her reach her goals as I'm worried about her health. She's gained at least 40-50 lbs since freshman year and at the rate she's going it's only a matter of time before she develops a weight-related disease.  I know it's impossible to motivate someone who can't/won't motivate themselves but are there any baby steps I can take to try and guide her towards healthier living? She's like a sister to me and I just want to keep her healthy and around as long as I can. 

EDIT: She also thinks lifting heavy will just make her look even bigger overall so she won't bother with weights. How do I convey to her that lifting will help her look smaller over time?

It was a freak accident and due to malpractice was not diagnosed for two months. My elbow underwent osteonecrosis and I had to have two extensive surgeries and pins/plates put in to try and cobble together some sort of joint. The doctors said I might never have normal use of that arm again. After a year of PT I got back to about 80% use (pretty much a miracle.) 

Fast forward to last summer: I took up yoga. My yoga teacher was really into having the class do headstands, but I just couldn't take that kind of pressure on my elbow (planks were not happening either.) I would sit dejectedly by the wall while everyone else worked on their headstand. Sad. :(

Well today after my core workout, I was feeling pumped (held a plank for 50 s!) and decided to try a tripod headstand. AND I DID IT! AND HELD IT! So so so excited.

I just moved into a subdivision behind a gym, and so I signed up for two months of personal training. I have worked out at home, but I wanted someone to evaluate my form and give me a routine blueprint.

Anyway, it was awful. I got there a few minutes early, and my trainer tells me to start warming up on the treadmill, and he'll come get me at 6:15. My time slot started at 6. Okay, so he's running a bit behind, no big deal.

I end up alternating jogging and walking for 20 minutes. I didn't want to push too hard, as I figured he would have a killer workout in store for me, and I didn't want to wear myself out. He comes over with a 5 lb disc weight and tells me to do bicep curls into shoulder presses for 6 minutes, then just shoulder presses for 6 minutes, then hold the weight above my head for 6 minutes. All while walking at a 12.0 incline at 2 mph. He says to do two sets of that and then disappears.

By the time I'm holding the weight over my head, my chest feels like it's in a vise. I take a few 10 second breaks, but I finish the first set. Right now I'm thinking 1) I could have thought of this myself and 2) This is boring. He comes back to check on me. I tell him that I can't breathe when I hold the weight over my head. I ask why we're not doing more work on the machines; that's kind of what I expected to be using at the gym. He tells me we need to build up my endurance first.

Then he takes me to the elliptical. Now, I've tried this machine, and I cannot for the life of me figure it out. I know I must be doing something wrong, but every time I try, my quads are on fire after about a minute. It feels like I'm running full speed up a flight of stairs. I tell him this. He tells me that it's a cardio exercise, my legs shouldn't be burning that much. I ask him to teach me how to use it properly. He says that there is no way to use it improperly. I stop after a minute because my legs are shaking.

He takes me back to the treadmill, saying that he just can't figure me out. He asks me to do a light jog for 15 minutes, then he's going to put me in the sauna for 20 minutes. I hate the sauna. I don't believe that losing water weight like that is healthy; I tell him this. He says it's very healthy, that it will tighten up my skin so it doesn't sag when I lose weight.

At this point, his 6:30 client is warmed up and ready. He asks how late I can stay. I tell him as late at it takes to get the full 30 minutes worth. He goes over to talk to a female trainer.

The next thing I know, the female trainer comes up and introduces herself as my new personal trainer. She asks if I'm doing my assessment. I tell her that I have no idea what the hell is going on. She starts to give me the disc weight. I tell her I've already done that. So she tells me to walk at a 12.0 incline at 3.5 mph for 15 minutes and then come find her.

I finish this and go looking for her. She's sitting at a table talking to another client. I wait for about 10 minutes, in her line of sight, before asking to speak to a manager. The trainer sees this and takes her client to a different part of the gym.

I have a meeting with the manager tomorrow to discuss refund options. Here's hoping I can get my money back.

I'm just so disappointed and frustrated. I had put money aside to do this, and I was so excited and committed. It took a lot of willpower not to just get dinner from the Taco Bell in the same parking lot on my way home.

This was mostly a rant, but if anyone has any suggestions on how to find the motivation to go back to the gym despite this awful experience, I would really welcome the advice!

People are always giving me different things to think about (""But don't you feel accomplished?"", ""... energized?"", ""... a mood boost?"") and I just can't seem to enjoy it. I've tried loads of different workouts too. Zumba, weight lifting, a couple of different martial arts, yoga, etc. but over the last few years, nothing has broken through my hatred of having to actually exercise. 

I'm wondering if the connection from exercise to endorphins is broken in my brain because I just plain don't understand what any of you are talking about. From the moment I begin to the moment I stop, I wish I was laying in my bed playing Sims 2. The only thing I can force myself through consistently is the Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred plan because at least it's less than 30 minutes long. It's become the worst part of my day because as much as I hate it, I really don't have a choice if I want to lose weight.

So to those of you who felt like me - what changed your mind? Or are you still like me - putting on your big girl panties and doing what's necessary?

**TL;DR:** What kind of workout made you actually enjoy doing it? Because I've got a big fat goose egg

**Edit:** I've been involved in tennis, basketball, cheerleading, softball, swim teams and soccer before, as well as a few others; I'm so uncoordinated that I usually end up sucking and then I feel bad for the other people who depended on my performance. I also may have mild scoptophobia (fear of being seen or stared at) which makes things like dancing in public really difficult. I'm going to be seeking help for that last bit soon.

**Edit II:** A few people have mentioned diet; just want to mention that I did the ""diet alone"" thing for a good long time before starting to exercise simply because I didn't want to exercise.

I do it with everything. 

Last week I got the message that my squat form was bad and I should feel bad, so over the weekend I started looking into ways and means for improving my squat.  First thing was lowering my working weight, which I did and I wont be increasing it till I'm solid on my form.  

The second thing, was looking at how the powerlifters manage to squat so heavy without bending over from the weight on their shoulders. I was watching [this guy's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UnQKGvl-CE) video he posted for that day's lifts, and noticed he takes a deep breath just before going down for every squat.  Not just a deep breath, but he holds it deep at the bottom of his lungs and pushes against his closed throat with his breath.  So I asked him ""how does holding your breath help with your squat?""  He said ""[Valsalva Maneuver](http://www.liftbigeatbig.com/2012/04/valsalva-maneuver.html).  It gives you more core stability and helps you tense your abdominal wall.""  

Holy crap, that's what I neeeed. 

So today, I did it.  It was weird, trying to get over that instinct to breathe through my movement, but once I did, my warm up sets felt like bodyweight squats.  I actually kept my chest lifted for most of my working squats &amp; the best part was I felt absolutely no lower back strain.  I felt that squat where you're supposed to feel it: in my legs and hips.  

Maybe these are things everyone else knows about how to squat, but it was definitely new for me.  I'm so excited to get better at them!

This post is a celebration of both my physical and mental transformations over the last few years.

**Looooong post. TL;DR – scroll down for photo links, in bold.**

Compared to other progress posts here and in /r/fitness, my changes in appearance may be relatively subtle, and my numbers unimpressive, but for me lifting has been life-changing.

Lifting has given me a huge confidence boost that translates into all aspects of life. I wish I had started at least 10 years ago. I’m not really a shy person, but throughout my teens and early 20s I struggled a lot with self-esteem and confidence. I have a history of depression, and for years, I was insecure and lonely, and couldn’t bear to spend time alone. I came to grips with a lot of these issues in my mid-20s, but lifting weights has been really pivotal for helping me feel like “hey, I’m awesome, I can kick some ass!”

Entering the weight room alone the first time was a bit intimidating, but now I feel like I belong, and even taught another female friend how to lift! Developing from a skinny-fat weakling has changed the way I carry myself. I just feel more confident, autonomous, and capable overall. Recently, my boyfriend and I helped a friend move, including an assembled [5-shelf IKEA Expedit bookcase] (http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/60208648/), up and down a few stairs and on and off a truck! My new-found strength has also opened up a new world of possibilities in terms of things to do for fun – most recently, indoor rock-climbing and bouldering!

**One of my goals with this post is to demonstrate to other women who are thinking of starting to lift that you don’t have to do things perfectly to see positive changes.** I did not follow Starting Strength properly. I read the book (twice) and studied form, and browsed this subreddit, /r/fitness, and /r/weightroom, etc. daily. But, I started the major lifts at different times because I was too chicken ([see my lifting graph](http://imgur.com/AILJaFL)). Doesn’t matter – I still did *something*, and I still made progress. I truly enjoy lifting, and I don’t have motivational issues with getting to the gym 3x/week (whereas spending ½ hour on the elliptical always felt like a chore for me). However, life happens, and sometimes even when I really want to go lift, other obligations get in the way. I’ve had setbacks and bumps in the road, both in terms of strength gains and my aesthetic goals. But I view lifting as a lifelong pursuit, and I’m trying to think in terms of the big picture and long run. In a few decades, I still want to be fit and active, not in pain and falling apart.

* Phase 1: I was your typical skinny-fat in my teens and early 20s – hovering ~123-128 lbs, wearing US size 4 (~ 33/28/35”). I looked slim, but was squishy and un-athletic. Pants were usually too baggy in the butt and thighs, but tight in the waist. I was a complete dunce in PE in high school. After college (thanks to a steady income), I dabbled in yoga, surfing, and horseback-riding, but could never stick with jogging or a gym program. My diet was nearly-vegetarian (except the vegetables part): primarily carbs (pasta or pizza nearly every day), tofu, fake-meat, and dairy.

* Phase 2: Put on pounds in my late 20s, when I started grad school, had a really wonky sleep schedule, stopped exercising (except commuting by bike 5 miles roundtrip, 5x/week), and ate ramen daily at 2AM. Stopped weighing myself, guessing ~135 lbs - not particularly heavy for my 5’5” frame (still squeezing into US size 4-6, ~35.5/ 30.5/37.5”), but because I carry weight pretty much only in my midsection instead of all over, I looked boxy. I regret not taking better “before” photos, but I was too ashamed to document myself in underwear or swimwear during this time, so here are a couple [**candid photos of Phases 1 and 2**](http://imgur.com/DBBTrba) (NSFW)

* Phase 3: Starting in March 2012, I counted calories (not easy!) and did cardio (Zumba 2-3x/week, horseback riding 1x/week, bike commuting) to lose weight. Combined with getting really sick (GI issue, not an advisable weight-loss strategy!), I got down to 119 lbs by June-July. But, I was still dissatisfied with my appearance – I had skinny arms and legs, but even with my waist the smallest it had ever been, I had no butt or boobs, and a visibly bony sternum (~32/26/34”). 

* Phase 4: Late Aug 2012, began bastardized version of Starting Strength in order to build a butt. Well, I did, along with unexpected improvements in other areas: well-defined and firm legs, arms, and back; plus, pecs gave me some boobage back. (Also, started frequenting /r/aBraThatFits recently – having a well-fitting bra has also been transformative!) I did not experience the dramatic waistline-whittling from lifting that many other girls do, but I think that’s just my body type. I still carry fat on my belly, but at least I no longer get muffin top or love handles in pants with tight waistbands (perhaps actually having abs underneath the fat helps reduce the squish). Now 126-127 lbs, still US size 4 (33/27/36”), but filling out the seat and thighs much better. **Photos of Phase 3 vs. 4 [front view](http://imgur.com/igPKIhF) and [back view](http://imgur.com/9GuVMnL), both relaxed** (NSFW)

**Lifting details:**
In late Aug, I started with only squat, bench/push-ups, and assisted chin-ups (finally got my first real chin-up in late Jan). I had done bench a little bit in high school, so I was comfortable starting with it, but I didn’t have a spotter so for a couple months I quit and did push-ups instead (went from knee and incline-pushups to 15+ real ones!). I ended up teaching a female friend to lift, and also joined my boyfriend’s gym, so I have spotters now. I didn’t start deadlift or OHP right away, which I regret. For DL, it can be an ordeal getting all the extra plates in position to raise the bar to the proper height during warmups (neither of my gyms has a platform or bumper plates). Turns out, I LOVE deadlifting so much, it’s worth the hassle to me (OMG I love deadlifting! Dat feel = so visceral &amp; triumphant!). I have been working with both conventional stance and sumo (more natural for me). For OHP, I feel guilty hogging the power rack at my very busy university gym right after squatting, so I don’t do it as often, and have made very little progress thus far. I also have not yet done powercleans (the shame!). I made strength gains until late March, but since returning from my most recent vacation, have just been working to return to the level I was at pre-break. [Here is my lifting graph again, all 5RM.](http://imgur.com/AILJaFL) **Also: [Flexing photos!](http://imgur.com/0z1eBCa)**(NSFW)

My PRs (lbs):

* Low-bar squat (3 x 5): Aug = 60^1 --&gt; 135 

* Bench (3 x 5): Nov = 65 --&gt; 82.5 (3 x 3 = 85)

* OHP (3 x 5): Dec = 45 --&gt; 55

* DL (conventional, 1 x 5): Nov = 85 --&gt; 170

* DL (sumo, 1 x 5): Nov = 105 --&gt; 190

(^1 My first time squatting, I felt pinching in my shoulders, so I used dumbbells instead for the first few workouts; when I tried the bar again I could do 60 lbs.)

I also do a 4-min Tabata sprint on the elliptical 1-2x/week after lifting. Still riding horses 1x/week and bike commuting, but I don’t “count” those as exercise anymore. With my increased fitness level, I’ve also tried more fun things like learning to play tennis, taking an aerial silks class, indoor rock-climbing and bouldering (which I think I’ll keep doing), and hiking more.

**About my diet:**
I’m not very good in this area, but I am *NOT* looking for advice – I know where I can improve, but I’m a former picky eater; working on it, but I still struggle to eat enough vegetables. My major accomplishment has been no longer relying so heavily on carbs like pasta and pizza, and not buying things like chips, crackers, or cookies. Also, gave up alcohol – now drinking plain water, unsweetened coconut water, or flavored sparkling water instead. Still working on not pigging-out at social events, including being ok with leaving food on my plate if I’m not enjoying it. 

Aiming for ~110 g protein daily. Basic routine: only black coffee until 11AM; jumbo hard-boiled egg; Gallo lite salami; ½ fuji apple with raw chunky almond butter (Trader Joe’s); ½ fuji apple with Knudsen cottage cheese (Costco); weight watchers smoked mozzarella string cheese; sometimes raw almonds &amp; walnuts, or roasted seaweed. Typical dinner: mixed green salad with olive oil &amp; balsamic, goat cheese, raisins, sliced almonds; or Brussels sprouts with bacon and shallots; some kind of meat, e.g. turkey sausage patty with shredded cheese and jumbo fried egg; lean ground beef, mushrooms, pasta sauce, quinoa; Costco rotisserrie chicken w/hot sauce; baked wild salmon, etc. Dessert: chocolate (e.g. Lindt 90) or ice cream (recently started making at home!). 

Lifting days: More carbs, e.g. ½ bag Trader Joe’s country potatoes w/mushrooms &amp; green beans with an egg scrambled in; or, oatmeal (made w/milk) with crumbled bacon, balsamic vinegar, goat cheese, and sprinkle of basil. Protein shake! Add in this order to Magic Bullet: frozen berries (Costco 3-berries), 2% milk (or almond milk + greek yogurt, depending on what I have around), ground flax, natural chunky PB, unsweetened coconut flakes, chocolate Designer Whey (which is sweetened w/stevia instead of sucralose).

**Acknowledgement:** I am extremely lucky to have a super-supportive boyfriend. A lifting-buddy gave him Starting Strength a few years ago. He never pushed me to try lifting, but when I expressed interest, he demonstrated the main lifts for me. I went to my university gym on my own for a few months, but got sick of the crowds, so I joined his gym too and we lift together regularly. He’s always been really active, so sometimes I’m amazed that he put up with my years of couch-potato laziness. In addition to lifting, we do more active things together now, and sharing more interests has only benefited our relationship. He’s been nothing but supportive and encouraging through the years, regardless of my physical and psychological ups and downs.

Here's to 30 being the best year yet!

All of these people were online, discussing fitness, trading tips on being healthy and trying to rid themselves of health industry bs.

But after a few weeks, I started to notice the negative side of things. There were the obvious ones, like ignoring any type of fitness outside of lifting heavy. But there was also such a short lived sense of accomplishment. If you were a woman or a man with greater than a certain body fat percentage, you needed to keep going. And even if you resembled the media prescribed ideal body, there was always an area you had to improve on. I've seen so many posts, especially ones surrounding female progress, that put down the OP because she simply wasn't their ideal shape. And if that individual said they were happy with their body now, it wasn't uncommon to see a post saying they were just being lazy. Obviously I'm generalizing here, and not all of it is like that, but those that are really get to me.

It wasn't necessarily the comments beneath the posts, either. The OP would often openly suggest that their accomplishments weren't enough. Titles like ""Oh I lost 100 lbs but I still have 15 more to go so I'm just a work in progress"" seem to pop up all the time. I just want to shout to the rooftops that these people are awesome and that they should celebrate their accomplishments and not worry about some number.

Probably the thing that bothers me the most is the fact that they proclaim not to obsess over numbers. They say it's about getting healthy, but really it's about looking a certain way, doing certain exercises and lifting certain numbers. They want men to lift as much as the Wolverine and women to have barbie bodies (especially b00bz). And when women do post progress pictures, they get oggled and blatantly harassed. Comments like ""oohh such good progress, and your tits are good too"". Awesome, thanks for complimenting a part of my body that probably has NOTHING to do with my fitness progress.

I'm not saying that bettering yourself throughout your life isn't healthy. But this constant attempt at doing more, more, more seems obsessive. There comes a point at the gym where I put away the weights and say ""Okay, time to go live my life"". I certainly don't want to put down people who treat fitness as their hobby. I think that's an entirely different scenario. But I feel like people like myself, who just want to be healthy and active, get pushed to the side a lot in these subreddits. Or even worse, put down. We're just the lazy population bringing down humanity.

So I quit. I don't quit fitness, but I quit those subreddits. They made me feel depressed and alone. It was like I was in a junior high fitness class where everyone made progress except me. Sure, I could probably accomplish what they did in that time if I worked harder in the gym and ate what they did. But I don't want to, it isn't my thing. I enjoy food too much, I enjoy drinking with my friends and I love just living my life.

I don't need their approval and I just want to say that neither does anyone, not on this subreddit or anywhere else.

I have been cutting and making some serious efforts to eat better as of late. I know for me a big part of why I ended up in a fitness slump is because I love eating bad food... consuming huge amounts of sweets at a time and craving sweet food almost every day.

So while it was possible to cut this stuff out, I still craved it. I have been trying to eat fewer carbs and more proteins since I started focusing on lifting. I make all my meals from scratch and I love baking, but all the things I love to bake are pretty much out at this point. My husband is also big into fitness and kind of lazy in the mornings so we had been buying Clif bars for him to take to work. (Grocery store has a 10 for $10 deal) I like clif bars but they're full of carbs with lots of sugar and expensive to boot. I knew there had to be a better way so I started looking around the interwebs with a divine idea to make my own protein bars for healthy, cheap, easy snacking.

I have made three batches so far and we go through about 1 batch/week. I've tweaked the recipe each time and this is the best I've been able to come up with. These are mega tasty, pretty nutritious, and convenient.

Made with my ingredients, here at the nutrition facts for the skeptical/scrupulous:
    * **200 calories**
    * **22g Carbs**
    * **9g Fat**
    * **11g Protein**
    * **2g Fiber**
    * **8g Sugar**

Ingredients:
    * 1 Tablespoon Honey
    * 1 Cup peanut butter
    * 2/3 Cup milk
    * 1 1/2 cups protein powder (4 scoops with my particular protein. I use the Optimum Nutrition double chocolate kind)
    * 2 cups old fashioned oats
    * 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (optional, I'm a chocolate fiend)

1.) In a saucepan over low heat melt honey, peanut butter, and milk. Stir until melted nicely together.
2.) Remove from heat, stir in protein powder until combined. If needed, add an extra splash of milk to dissolve it. Add chocolate chips and stir until melted.
3.) Add oats and stir until combined.
4.) In a 9x13 pan, pour sauce pan contents. Press firmly and evenly into the bottom of the pan. I use a rubber spatula to do this.
5.) put bars in fridge to harden/set. Only needs an hour or two but longer is fine. Cut into 16 equal pieces and nom nom!

Other tips: I trace the outline for cutting up the bars w/ the tip of the spatula before putting them in the fridge. This makes it easier to cut them up, which I usually do with a metal spatula. The consistency of these guys is like that of a Clif bar... mushy, but still solidly held together. Since they have milk in them I leave mine in the fridge for storage, but if I take one out to put in the gym bag I don't worry about it.

1326606265.0,57,self.xxfitness,ohp0t,How I was wrong about my bra size and body proportions after weight loss,boomerzoomer,66,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/ohp0t/how_i_was_wrong_about_my_bra_size_and_body/,"Let's talk about boobs (again).

After I lost excess weight, I despaired that I went from a 36B to a 34A.

I've always been flat-chested, but when my weight ballooned up I was a B-cup ""for the first time in my life.""  I even considered quitting getting fit for a brief moment when it seemed like my chest was getting smaller, but powered through the doubt and decided that numbers and cleavage weren't as important as the other benefits of fitness.

Flash forward to today, and I'm trying to find a new bra to fit my more petite body size.  I slowly started realizing that my 36A bras were super loose on me, and that I've been constantly wearing the 34A bra that I bought as an experiment.

But bra fitting utterly perplexes me.  Online calculators kept giving me different sizes (36A, 36AA, 38CC?!, and ""no bra is needed"". Sigh).  I couldn't decipher how the hell bra companies categorize their titties.

Then, while reading [r/ABraThatFits](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/), I stumbled upon [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syiA4yelmYk&amp;feature=player_embedded).  And after that video, I went and tried some things on.

Long story short, I just figured out that **I'm actually a 30B, and that my body shrank proportionally.**  Holy crap.

I admit to being a bit dismissive of the XX FAQ's point that weight loss usually doesn't affect the boobage, because the bra size should be proportional.  Fat goes, but actual breast tissue should remain.  I just thought - nah.  Not in my case, stupid genetics.  I lost a cup size!  Oh well.

Nope, I was wrong.  And now I'm actually thinking seriously about boobies.  Because I realize that I have always been timid about wondering if I might need a bigger cup/smaller band, like it was wishful thinking or vanity. Honestly, I'm still in disbelief, but sure enough I can stretch all of my current bra bands about 4+ inches away from my body.  Before this, I actually thought I had a monstrously large ribcage!

All along, I've been subtly sabotaging my body image by mis-measuring.  What the hell, self?

Note:  Not that having different body proportions would be bad or unattractive.  My point is that I was definitely estimating my size wrong and mentally skewing my body proportions in my head toward something that didn't make sense or reflect reality.  I'm wondering if other gals on here have done the same.  In my experience, losing a cup size through exercise is a fear that's almost as common as ""getting bulky"" for women in fitness, so I thought I'd share. :)

1370086115.0,56,self.xxfitness,1fgkg7,"I want to lose weight, but I'm afraid that all of the restrictiveness of dieting and calorie-counting is starting to literally drive me insane. Please help!",TawnyLioness,69,13,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1fgkg7/i_want_to_lose_weight_but_im_afraid_that_all_of/,"Hey ladies, I'm posting here because it seems like a safe space where health (physical AND mental) is the overall goal rather than where the solution is just ""becoming more determined and bucking up"" like it sometimes seems to be at r/loseit. I know this is a long post, sorry. There's a TL;DR at the bottom if you want to skip to it.

For the past 3 years, I've been attempting to lose fat with only small periods of success followed by an overall gain of weight. I'm 20, 5'10 and 176 lbs, which is 10 lbs up from where I started 3 years ago. That whole time, I've tried to use calorie counting as my primary means of fat loss, which did work well when I was able to stick to it.

Unfortunately, the longer I went on, the harder it was to stick to my daily limit, and the more obsessive and miserable about food I got. I would have periods of several weeks where I would stick to my goal more or less, but I would feel hungry and restless and constantly focusing on when my next meal would be and wondering whether I would be satisfied with it and just wishing I could eat a big bowl of ice cream or potato chips. Eventually, my willpower would break and I would do just that, binge on junk food and then hate myself after. And then the cycle would repeat. By trying to control myself I ended up feeling like I had NO control whatsoever.

I am just so sick of living that way. It's no way to live!

Earlier in May I went on a vacation and decided to just completely ditch the diet. No calorie counting, just eating whatever I wanted whenever I was hungry. It. Felt. Wonderful. I had a peace of mind that I hadn't felt in ages, not caring how much I weighed in that particular moment, because really, it didn't matter in the grand scheme of things; I just wanted to enjoy the vacation that I had worked for. I knew I would probably gain weight, and I did, about 5 lbs. But I felt so free without the constant background chatter going in my head about how I was hungry and what should I eat and can I eat this, no it has too many calories etc. etc.

The thing is, now that I'm back in the real world I do still want to lose weight, but the idea of going back to dieting is kind of scary. I don't know how I can possibly do it without going back to the way I was before. For the past few days I've been trying to just eat when I'm hungry and stop when I'm full but I'm afraid that won't create enough of a deficit for weight loss.

I also want to start weight lifting again (I tried briefly last summer, but gave up because I wasn't eating enough and quickly started stalling, not to mention it just exacerbated my hunger... I realize retrospectively) but from what I've seen it's important to keep track of your macros if you want to gain muscle, but to do that I'll have to start tracking all of my food again (which is hardly different from calorie counting).

I guess I just want to know, how do you guys do it? How do you keep track of all of your calories without going insane and becoming unhealthily obsessed with food? What can I do to keep working towards my goals, but at the same time not making the rest of my life miserable for it? I've spent 3 years going around in dieting circles, I just want to stop.

This is my first post here; I've lurked for a while at r/fitness, and just come to xxfitness. I wanted to share my non-scale victory with you guys. . . For the first time in two years, I ran 3 miles. It was not a consistent run, but it was still under 40 minutes and I'm proud of myself. 

This is a huge deal for me, because even though I've been (admittedly intermittently) back in the game since January, I've been struggling with my running lately. I have had problems with my hips since my sophomore year of high school; I don't have enough cartilage, so overuse results in sharp pain in my joints. On top of that, I bought new running shoes, but the arches are too high, so I ended up with a blister on each foot. 

In addition, I just started cutting carbs, and I'm on my period, so the first week of the new diet has been super screwy. I noticed a huge decline in my performance, but I told myself that if I had to crawl to finish my 3 miles, I would. And I did.

Some background and stats: I'm 23, 5'3"", and about 175lbs. My current goal is 140. I'm afraid if I go lower than that, I'll be all hip. 

I started last summer at 185, dropped the first 5 pounds easily by watching what I ate, but have been stuck between 174 and 178 since then. I'm very lazy when it comes to portions and calorie counting, even though I know it would probably be the easiest way to drop the weight. (That's actually why I decided to cut most carbs; I think it will be easier for me to stay under a calorie goal if I'm not eating as many sandwiches.) I'm a huge fan of cardio; I love to run. I've also picked up some weight lifting for a little variety, but I've slacked a lot more on the lifting lately.

Last night, I was doing my normal routine at the gym. I had finished my standard 30-minutes of cardio (trying to lose weight), and I was moving onto my lifting, aka the fun part. Things were going good, and I even noticed some positive progress with my squats!

That is, until I started my warm-up for my bench press. It was a relatively low weight, and definitely something I've done before and am confident doing. But last night, something went wrong. I got 2 reps in, and suddenly, my left arm just caved. Went dead. Wouldn't work. Just flaccid. It was a lower weight, so I was able to compensate with my right arm and slowly lower the bar down. At this point, I'm in disbelief and kind of freaking out. But the worst part was the dudebro with his t-shirt without sleeves and little bottle of protein shake standing next to me. He was staring the entire time, and just started shaking his head and said in the most patronizing tone, ""better luck next time honey"", emphasizing the ""honey"" part.

I was so embarrassed, I ended up just leaving the gym. I've never had muscles fatigue like that on me before, but it's not what hurts the most. What hurt was that I like to project the strong woman image, and the patronizing dudebro just shattered my pride. And now I'm feeling scared about even trying bench presses again.

So ladies, have any of you experienced something like this before? How did you get over the hurt feelings so you could go back to lifting like a beast?


**Edit** I wanted to thank everyone for all the pep talks and advice. Come Monday, I'm getting back into that gym, lifting heavy, grunting, and not taking shit from anyone.

And apparently the squat fairy blessed me in infancy, because I have perfect freaking form. HELL. YEAH. Surprised the heck out of my sister, who finds deadlifting very intuitive but struggles with squatting form. Go figure. While my legs could have handled a ton more weight, we capped that one at 65 as well, because my shoulders were a little pissed with the new arrangement. ""What, you want us to put that bar WHERE?"" I hope they quit complaining soon, because I'm certainly not going to stop. 

Next week I'm going to learn to clean and overhead press as well. I know it doesn't sound like a lot, but for a newbie who resembles a 110 pound noodle, it feels like a big step forward.

I'm stuck on Week 3 of Zombies, Run! (1 min running, 1 min walking). I get a side stitch every time and feel exhausted. Today I started crying in the last minute of my run/walk drills, so I didn't do the free form runs, and walked them instead. I don't know if I should keep repeating it 'til it's easier or move on. The next drill is a 5 min run. I can barely do 1.

I don't really know what I'm doing with weight training. I made a workout buddy in the gym and I'm going to take notes. But I'm pretty weak. I can only deadlift about 50 lbs and I can't curl 10. And sometimes, I struggle but then I'm not even sore the next day and I don't know why.

I'm pretty inflexible. I started doing [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1iO31O41vk) power yoga video, which I like because it's faster so I don't get as impatient. I'm super tight and can barely get close to what the dude is doing.

I know I have to keep going and that it will get better. I've been eating less than before. I don't count so don't really know by how much, but I get about 60g of protein, what my nutrition major workout buddy said was good, so I was on track with that. I lost 9 lbs, so I'm about 13 lbs away from my goal. 

But oh God. It gets discouraging, you know? The struggle to keep running or start running. How sometimes I'm not sore at all from the gym, even the time I couldn't get the bar off me while benching (20 lbs, no less). How I can't get into position and I feel like an old man trying to stretch.

At what point did you stop sucking? I mean those fellow Slow Pokes who used to never exercise. My girlfriend has done sports since she was a little girl so it's hard to compare myself to her, I try not to, but you know. It gets kind of discouraging. I still go, don't get me wrong. But shit. It's confusing and it's hard and I feel really weak, both physically and mentally. Does it get easier? I don't know how I'm going to get swole as fuck. It seems like such a far off goal, and I'm scared I'll never get there.

Some backstory: About 4 years ago I was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and couldn't do anything without having to take a nap. I slept almost 24/7. When I got sick my weight plummeted and I was the most out of shape I've ever been. I lost what little muscle I had before. During this whole period my resting heart rate was over 100bpm. (May have partially been caused by some medication I was on)

Since then I have slowly recovered from the extreme fatigue. In the past 4 years I have gone from not being about to walk up the stairs without laying down to enjoying exercise! Now I'm on a mission to become stronger and improve my health even more. I just started exercising about 3 weeks ago. It began with really low intensity stuff like going on nightly walks. Then I stepped it up to cardio at the gym and even running a little! I can honestly say that even 2 years ago I could never picture myself doing what I have done the past month.

VICTORY: Today I took my pulse and it was 70bpm! Oh my gosh! I couldn't believe it so I kept re-doing it, and sure enough... :)

I know that there is still room for improvement, but this was the first big result I've gotten from my new active lifestyle! I'm over the moon :)",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_xcg2z,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/xcg2z/my_first_fitness_victory/,

Tracking for a week let me lose one pound, which I suppose is a good start.  Tracking my water intake has also been making a good change.  This week I'm altering my diet a little bit, and am going to start walking some more and seeing if that will make a change.  

How many of you have started up this week?  Any advice?  As stated previously.. I'm 23, five foot seven, and 260 pounds.  Hoping to lose around 120 pounds.

They say that you just have to find the type of exercise that works for you: dance, running, swimming, group classes, etc. Well, I'd tried all of them, but for one reason or another I'd stop going. On average, I'd exercise 1-2x/month.

This week, I was inspired by someone on 2x who posted about Insanity. I downloaded a bunch of workout videos and started doing them at home. Now all I have to do is hit play and walk three steps from my desk chair. I usually grab water and shorts as well. Sometimes I follow the video, sometimes I make up my own moves, but I keep on moving. 

So far it's working for me! It has a low enough barrier to entry that I actually start, and it's fun enough that I keep coming back. 5 times this week is huge for me, and I'm excited to keep going!

http://www.xojane.com/issues/the-whole-concept-of-the-beach-body-bikini-body-is-ridiculous-and-this-is-why 

First let me say that I 100% agree that anyone, no matter the level of fitness or body shape, should never feel that they can't get out and enjoy the beach, pool or any other activity that requires a swim suit or minimal attire.  As humans, we should just respect each other enough to enjoy the beach without judging or being judged.

So here is where I might sound a tad bitchy.  My problem comes with what the author describes as ""Problem #2.""  Damn right, I think that having a toned body is a personal achievement.  I've worked really hard for it but I sure as heck didn't do it at the expense of someone else.  And the idea that people who have achieved a fit body have done so by doing ""a bazillion miserable crunches whilst subsisting on juice made from rocks and dirt"" is just uneducated.  I'm sure that's an exaggeration but it perpetrates the myth of - starve, do crunches and you'll look great. UGH.  

I lift weights 4 times a week and do kickboxing at least two additional days.  I eat clean probably 75% of the time (1800 cals a day) and not once have I been tempted to eat rock and dirt juice to drop a few lbs.  It's about being healthy and strong first and foremost.  A great side effect is feeling (and looking) good in a bikini. 

So that's mostly a rant but I feel like yes, everyone who wants to...please get out and enjoy the beach but also, please don't think that anyone in ""beach body"" shape is being prideful at others expense or only doing crunches and drinking mud juice.",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_1d1bus,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1d1bus/the_concept_of_a_beach_body/,

If I just eat less, I'll have no energy to recover from the things I'm doing. So that 80% is really not about eating less but about finding a sweet spot based on your activities, what you need to recover, and still losing fat.

I know everyone is different, based on size, activities, cutting or bulking, etc., but I still find one of the most reassuring things to see while trying achieve my goal, is the amount that other people eat. While counting calories and tracking, I feel it becomes all to easy to fall into a trap of eating too little, thinking results will be faster.

Background: joined a brand new gym in Dec. 2012 after being frustrated with cleanliness and repair issues at my former gym.  New gym had promise, charged $39/month, had a nice staff, and had a solid weights setup.  I was pretty firm on joining that I was looking primarily for barbell training.  

Things were great for 4 months.  I lifted 3-4x per week, saw progress, all that happy stuff.  I walk in to lift the first week of April (2013) to see the weight room half empty with the squat rack and bench shoved into a corner smack on top of one another.  WTF!?

I speak with one of the owners to find they're installing a large, functional fitness rack 20'x30' that will have bars/bumpers, TRX hook ups, pull up bars, and other doo-dads.  Okay, fair enough.  I will deal with your cramped-ass weight room for now.

May 2013: no rack.  No bumper plates.  They have stuck a bunch of aerobic steps and small dumbbells in the open space.  

June 2013: same deal.  My membership increases to $59/month.  Hmm, can we not pay our bills at this facility?

July 2013:  again, same bullshit.  I speak to the ""general manager"" about what's going on.  He wants to offer powerlifting classes and wants to expand into the adjacent building.   Oooookay.  Sounds like a bunch of pipe dreams with zero financial backing.

August 2013:  I saw 2 45-lb bumper plates.  Not to be an ass but that doesn't cut it when you're deadlifting over 200 lb.  Still a bunch of empty space, otherwise.  Now I'm pissed.

So, should I cut my ties (and lose my deposit) or hold out for this magical fitness rack to arrive?

I've noticed lately as I've become a bit more fit and less squishy (down to an AUS size 10, from 14-16) she's been increasingly less friendly to me, to the point where I noticed today she avoided even making eye contact with me when we walked past each other. In general once it became clear I was putting in more effort than is the norm, I started to feel ostracised by the bigger girls at work. Nothing in my demeanour has changed.

Also I'm helping my friend lose weight, she is currently about 2 sizes bigger than I am, and we're a team supporting and encouraging each other - sharing failures and victories, but her in-laws with whom she lives don't support her and are giving her a lot of flak. Apparently when she did her gorceries recently they complained that she was buying separate food and her father in law said ""Next you'll be doing slut squats and end up like Nighneve - is that what you want?!""

Can you answer:

* age

* height

* weight

* body shape or measurements

* maybe how long you've been working out/what you do to work out

**edit** thanks to everyone who replied. i'll give you my story too...

January 2010 (19) : 180 and never measured. size 14 jeans. 

Now (21) : 130. 33 inch bust (36 leaning over as I saw on /r/bestof). 28 inch waist. (at the thinnest part right?) 39 inch hips. 

I went down to 150 by an extreme reduction in stress. I was small though weak and not toned, as a kid. 16-20 was spent in a terrible LTR that messed me up bad. 

My boyfriend is a roofer and very fit. He always thought I looked good but my hips and bum are quite big. It doesn't look good either - all stretch marks and cellulite. (some girls look very hot with my measurements or bigger. Just not me.) I've tried to go to the gym but I get fatigued easily and go home. He also encourages me to eat more of a variety than Ramen and spaghetti. Salad is so good. I never had it until a month ago. I just have cucumbers, real bacon bits, lettuce and chicken. I could eat just that every day. 

My dad's new wife has a treadmill and they both work all day. I have access to it and a completely empty house (save my sister in the summer) and shower so I do that sometimes. I bought Brazil Butt Lift by Beachbody (the guys who make Insanity) and it is amaaazing. I am falling out of the size sixes (American Eagle for comparison) I bought at a yardsale 18 days ago. I've drank 30 oz of soda a day and eaten fast food 3-4 times and I have lost four inches total off my body in TWO WEEKS. Sorry for advertising but I am very very pleased with the product. 

I see many of you have lost a lot and that is awesome! If you guys upvote this and get enough replies (50 maybe?) I can chart it and we can save it. It can be discouraging to feel like you don't look good enough even after working hard - it's good to break it down and see we are all the same.

In the media it's always, ""Lose 10 lbs.! Shrink your arms! Change your body! Grow your hair longer! Build a Kardashian booty!""

But when's the last time you read a magazine and it encouraged you to REALLY sit down and pick out the things you LOVE about yourself? I think it's so important, no matter WHAT part of your fitness journey you are on, to project positivity and love your body the way it is NOW,  instead of constantly picking at your fat, grimacing in the mirror, and complaining to your SO. 

I know I'm definitely guilty of all of those things, but I find when I really try to pick out the positives about myself, I can feel better about myself and remain confident even on those days when you just are feeling down about yourself.

So this is what I'm asking you guys to do: 

Write down things you absolutely LOVE about your body. It could be *anything.* Post pics if you want, even! Let's exhibit some positivity instead of the self-hate that is so prevalent in all of us from time to time. I know it's hard sometimes to pick out the things you actually like instead of want to improve, but this is a challenge that will make you feel a ton better, I promise :)

I'll start!
* I love my triceps. A lot. 
* I also love my back! It's so much more toned than it used to be and I think a toned, muscle-y back is so unique and exudes health and strength.
* I like my forearms!

I've managed to DROP like 3-5 pounds in the process of this which is pretty rad too. I feel awesome, I can run longer, but I don't guilt myself if I don't feel like doing cardio after my lifts.

Also not ashamed to say one of my goals is to be one of THOSE girls who lifts, looks hot and generally treats the gym as her playground. 

In any case, this is all adding up to my favorite victory, which was a 135 DL 3rm. At my height and weight this is not actually that impressive, but literally 2 weeks ago I started at 85 lb. I might feel it tomorrow, but no more underestimating my strength.

Last summer my parents were convinced I was anorexic (which I definitely was not--I ate constantly!) so I decided to start lifting instead of only doing cardio. After a year of lifting regularly and adding soy protein shakes into my diet, I've started to gain muscle for the first time in my life! I feel healthier and I am much happier with my appearance. Still have a while to go though!

I don't eat dairy or meat products which make gaining weight difficult but I do drink soy protein shakes (can't have whey). I eat lots of fish, shellfish, and eggs for other protein sources.

I lift four to five times a week and I stopped cardio all together. But I try to keep my workouts under 45 minutes with minimal rest between interval sets so I keep my heart rate up.

For some people, these diets may be the catalyst needed to make a healthy lifestyle transformation. For me, however, switching back to a low-cal diet with carbs AND protein was what I needed to take my workouts (specifically, distance running) to the next level.


When I first tried keto, I had sugar cravings all the time that I'd try to remedy by just eating almonds continually. I didn't gain that much weight, but then again I was going to the gym 6x/week and it certainly didn't slim me down at all. When I'd get to the gym, I'd feel lethargic if I tried to do long-distance running, so I got into strength training instead. 


Above all I enjoy running, though, and after a while I started to miss it. More importantly, I missed not wanting to stop the entire time when I was doing it (especially 4+ mile slower-paced runs). So I went off the keto wagon (is that the phrase?) and never looked back.


Now, if I eat a carb-heavy (not necessarily large, but carb-tastic I guess is a better way of putting it) snack before a long workout run, I feel like the energizer bunny. I just friggin' GO. I have more energy throughout the rest of the day too. And -- here's the kicker -- I'm not gaining weight. If anything I'm losing it. Of course, everyone's workout plan is different, and a ""high"" carb diet is certainly more conducive to a runner's lifestyle than a couch dweller's, but I just wanted to remind any of you out there if you're getting discouraged with keto that more conventional low-fat diets can do wonders too. If eliminating every last possible glycolytic substrate from your daily nutrition works for you, great. But if not, don't push it -- find something that's comfortable and sustainable for you. For me, that is nomming the bejesus out of some carbs before I run. And then maybe after.

We just wrapped up Round 10!

With ten successful rounds under our (much) smaller belts, we’re excited to start Round 11 and we’re hoping others will join in.

**What 90days is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes (check out /r/BTFC for that). This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

Every morning there's a Daily Goal thread where you can post your goals, ask questions, or read through other people’s updates. There's a weekly check-in thread every Monday and several themed posts (Runners, Fitocracy challenges, Students, Women Losing Weight) throughout the week to keep us all on track.

If you'd like to join us for the next round, stop by and tell us about yourself and your goals in the [official introduction thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/comments/1i0967/mod_official_introduction_thread_for_round_11/). Round 11 will officially begin on Monday, July 15th. On Day 1 there will be a signup form to fill out so that we can keep track of group statistics. Group and individual progress will be posted at the end of each month using a display name based on your age, gender, height, and weight (we'll describe how to decipher it all later).

**What are these sprints I keep hearing about?**

You'll see the word ""sprints"" thrown around quite a lot.  Don't worry, we're not going to force anyone to go sprinting.  Sprints are what we do to make it easier to stick to the whole 90 days!  We've split the 90 days into 3 sprints, each one 30 days long plus a 5 day rest period in between.  Why did we do this?  Well, we found out that more people stuck around if they could focus on their goals for shorter periods of time and then have a short rest before resuming.  When you set your goals, you can not only set goals for the entire 90 days, but also for each sprint!

**What's the schedule?**

Sprint 1: July 15 - August 13

Recovery: August 14 - August 18

Sprint 2: August 19 - September 17

Recovery: September 18 - September 22

Sprint 3: September 23 - October 22

TLDR; If you’re interested, subscribe to /r/90daysgoal. Day 1 is July 15th. There will be informational posts throughout the first couple weeks to get everyone started toward their goals. We'll have a progress/recovery week at the end of each month. The final day will be October 22nd. I hope we’ll all have something to celebrate in three months!

**Early life:**
I was always a skinny child. Sometime during middle school, my boobs grew considerably and I became less skinny, but I wasn't big. In tenth grade, my weight spiked upwards for reasons I've never really figured out, but it got to the point where I was extremely uncomfortable ever wearing a bathing suit in public. And then for more reasons unknown (though it may have to do with joining dance team), I dropped a ton of weight in my senior year of high school. It stayed that way for the entire summer after high school, even though I wasn't exercising and I was eating a lot.

**Early college:**
I continued to eat a lot and not exercise in my  first semester of college. I rapidly gained weight, though I never came close to where I was sophomore year of high school. Come January 2011, I decided I needed to go on a serious diet. I tried for about a week and then stopped. When summer hit, I tried once more to diet. I thought I did okay (and I took some Zumba/spin/aerobics classes), but it didn't result in any weight loss. 

**The turning point and onward:**
January 2012 came, and I decided to make serious lifestyle changes. I changed my diet completely. It was sort of a modified paleo diet, but I didn't know about paleo at the time. I just told myself I was going to stick to fruits, veggies, and nuts. I was vegetarian before this, but I started eating seafood to add something more to what I ate. I also began the Couch to 5K program. I noticed myself losing weight. When C25K ended, I briefly tried the 10K version, but I'm not a runner and I hated it. 

I then decided that I needed something else that had structure and a solid endpoint, so I bought Insanity. At the end of month one, my body looked the best it had ever looked. I moved into a shared dorm room (from a single dorm) at the end of month one, and I didn't want to bother my roommate, so I started doing it less and never completed the second month. I'd use the gym a lot for cardio. My eating habits still continued. We're at about June 2012 at this point.

So I met a guy in June, and even though we were both healthy eaters, we totally killed each other's habits by July. We ate a ton of unhealthy food on our dates, and I gained some weight. I kept working out though, so it wasn't a horrible gain. At the end of the summer, he introduced me to lifting, and I learned a few basic exercises. During the fall of 2012, I started to mix them in with some cardio. My diet for fall 2012 varied considerably. I'd have healthy weeks followed by unhealthy followed by healthy, and so on. 

I lived with this guy over winter break (Dec 2012 - Jan 2013), and we basically did a bulking phase. Lots of heavy weights in the gym, lots of food (but nothing too junk-y). I learned so much more about lifting through his instruction. I've now been back in school for a little while, and I'm eating around maintenance and lifting most days of the week. I feel excellent about my body. I think I'm going to do one more bulk phase during the winter and then cut with a few months left before summer.

**Pictures:** 

Here's a comparison of January '11 (freshman year), January '12 (sophomore, start of the serious January-June lifestyle change), and January '13 (now): http://i.imgur.com/P6XIlaf.png
*To really compare my legs, note that my feet are far apart in the first picture and almost together in the last.*

Here's a picture of right before the summer after freshman year, when I think my body was at its worst during the college years: http://i.imgur.com/d4vBTvJ.png

Here's a comparison of early summer '12 (the best my body has looked, in my opinion), late summer (after eating too much/too unhealthily for a couple months), and now: http://i.imgur.com/KRF0aPR.png

And finally, here is my arm when I flex, since you can't see differences with my hands on my hips. I have never had any sort of noticeable muscle there when I flex until this past month. http://i.imgur.com/xVOcBRO.jpg

She held herself up as an example of someone who doesn't do ab exercises yet has visible abs. She credited her genetics. The blogger urged her readers to focus on health and fitness more in general and to accept how their genetics shape them. 

**[This is a (blurry, sorry) snapshot of my grandfather when he won Mr. New England (a regional competition for Mr. America) back in 1963.](http://imgur.com/R3ygMJK)** The man was a powerhouse in his heyday. A true cross trainer. He owned a 'health club', was a boxer and trained boxers, did and taught karate, designed gym equipment and had his bodybuilder/welder friend build the machines that would be the precursors to machines that are in every gym today, and he did bodybuilding, you know, in his spare time. 

**The point of this post: the man was jacked and he still didn't have a six pack.** Sure, its possible that he didn't *do* ab exercises, thus not building those muscles specifically, but there's no way that he could have been good at everything he did (and he was) without having strong abs.

I used to marvel at this photo as a kid, but taking another look at it today with that blog post in mind as I near 30 and my [hottest body ever](http://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/1i7j47/30f_52_2008_148ish_lb_2013_128is_lb_accidental/) has helped me to find perspective with my own goals.

And since not everyone has a fitness freak in their family history to learn about their potential optimal form from, I thought I'd trot this out as an example of how **being fit and strong does not guarantee that your body is capable of taking on the specific shape that you are aiming for, and not finding that shape doesn't make you any less of a badass.**

Since this is xxfitness, off-topic fun fact: My mom was a badass, too. On the same day that my grandfather had upset my mom she also happened to be at his karate class. As he went to use her to demonstrate [flipping someone over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9k-uZyXvoA&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=69s), she caught him off guard and flipped *him* instead. She told me this story as a threat when I turned into a pissy teenager. I'm happy to report she never followed through with said threat.

I am trying out a new gym close to my work. I don't like change, and gyms are a particularly intimidating environment for me to be the ""new girl"". So, I walk in with overly-confident bravado to cover up the fact that I am uncomfortable, and I'm trying to portray the ""I know what I'm doing so don't bug me"" vibe to all the bro-lifters in the weight room.

I march up to a squat rack, brazenly load my normal weight (that's right, no practice reps), get into deadlift position, and... utter fail. I am nearly pulling my shoulders out of their sockets and getting red in the face but I can't even budge the bar. Still focusing too much on trying to seem like I'm in control - I just think I must be off my game, and remove a tiny amount of weight. Utter failure again. By now I'm noticing the guy next to me is lifting a lot lower weight than I have loaded, and that he's giving me pitying sideways glances.

That's when I clue in that the plates are in kilograms. I had been trying to deadlift a polar bear.

I shame-facedly unloaded all the weight and started over, mentally calculating the correct weight.

But, silver lining! I got all my reps in AND realized afterward that I had managed despite everything to blow away my previous personal best of 110 lbs - I did 3x8 of 135 lbs!

I’m training for the women’s Figure or Physique classes. The deciding factor for which class I enter, is how lean and muscular I can get by show time. But before I go into this, I’m going to tell you a little bit about my exercises habits, my diet, and my body *before* I started training for bodybuilding.

**Before: Exercise**

I am a world class powerlifter (I feel silly typing it out). I have set a few world records in powerlifting and was training for strength in the big three lifts (bench, squat, and deadlift). 

I exercised 5 days a week, and each work out consisted of weight training for strength. I did absolutely no cardio, with exception to lifting a little faster and with shorter breaks, once a week.

**Before: Diet**

I ate whatever I wanted and drank lots of delicious beer (I’m a huge fan of stouts and scotch ales). I ate spaghetti, nachos, oatmeal, mac and cheese, pizza, burgers, eggs, etc etc delicious things. Maybe you’re wondering…’where are the vegetables!?’ I would always try to just dump chopped veggies into these dishes to try and make myself feel better about what I was eating.

As a college student, I drank (sometimes very heavily) every Friday or Saturday night, and a 1-2 nights during the week.

**Before: My Body/Emotional Health**

Before starting, my weight reached an all-time high of 150lbs. I’m 5ft 3 and was thick all over. My body was thick all over from lifting, but I had a bit of a belly developing and a layer of fat covering my arms, legs, and back. I had always been unhappy about the way my body looked and wanted to be leaner. But never having an actual goal or competition to work towards, I would stray from any lame attempt at dieting and go right back to where I was. I was getting depressed about it. I stopped wearing certain clothes because I was getting self-conscious about the fat on my body. I almost ate *more* junk food as I got more depressed. I don’t really know *why* I did that, I just…did.

It was my boyfriend who finally challenged me to take control and do something about it. My boyfriend competes in bodybuilding competitions for fun, and as a way to control and maintain his weight. So he suggested that I do one too.

**After: Exercise**

*Cardio.* Seriously. I know /r/fitness, /r/iron, /r/weightroom, /r/weightlifting, and /r/swoleacceptence may hunt me down and kill me for this, but cardio was essential. I started out with 30minute cardio sessions added to my daily workouts, 3x a week. It wasn’t much, but I didn’t want add too much cardio at once, and hate it more than I already did. I always did the cardio *after* I lifted weights. The cardio would help work out lactic acid to help prevent soreness the next day, and it also gave me some time to cool down from weight training.
My cardio sessions were just me walking on the treadmill at 3mph at an incline of 10% to 14%. After a week or two of this, I began upping the cardio is 45min at 4x a week. *Then* I joined an hour long Bootcamp class offered through my gym. It was terrible, and I puked a couple times during or after the class. But competing against the other girls (in my head) to do more rounds, or finish the workout first, kept me going. The HIIT-like class really jump started my weight-loss journey. 

I began attending this Boot camp class 3x a week, an hour of walking on the treadmill 3x a week, and weight training 5x a week. 

**After: Diet** *Disclaimer: I want to stress how *not* hungry I was. I had cravings, but I was never starving or hungry. I ate until I felt full. I never counted calories or tracked macros. I didn't do these things because I didn't really have time to figure it out or keep track. I would get bored trying to keep track of the calories I took in and was burning.*

*Things I ate a lot of:* chicken breast, greek nonfat plain yogurt, oats, apples, peas, eggs, green beans, Frank’s Red Hot Sauce, mushrooms, fish, and coffee (no mochas or caramel macchiatos!! Black coffee with a little bit of skim milk). (If you don’t like peas, substitute broccoli) 

*Things I ate occasionally:* skinny cow ice cream bars (these really helped when I was craving chocolate), peanut butter, gin &amp; tonic or glass of wine, avocados, apple sauce, brown rice, almonds, and walnuts.

*Things I cut out:* pasta, bread, candy, soda, juice (too much sugar…), beer (this killed me), getting drunk off of hard alcohol, butter, and fast food.

**A typical day:**

* Breakfast: 1 egg + 2 egg whites scrambled + salt and pepper + frank’s hot sauce, half an avocado sliced + a cup of coffee

* Lunch: 1 cup of greek yogurt + 6 chopped walnuts + half an apple diced + 1 banana; optional: 1 tablespoon of applesauce to sweeten it up.

* Snack!: 1 apple sliced up with this delicious dip I made; peanut butter, yogurt, a little bit vanilla extract. I usually ate about a cup of the dip.

*Insert 1.5 hours of weight training and then 1 hour of cardio/Boot camp here*

* Dinner: One Sliced Chicken Breast cooked in a pan + diced onions + Frank’s Sauce + sliced mushrooms and a side of peas (2 cups of peas)

* Optional Dessert: **ONE** Skinny Cow ice cream bar or ice cream sandwich

**My Workout Schedule**

Monday: Squats and legs + Boot Camp

Tuesday: Bench + Back and upper body + Cardio 

Wednesday: Deadlifts and legs + Boot Camp + Cardio

Thursday: OHP + Back and upper body + Cardio

Friday: Squats and legs + Boot Camp

**My Body/Emotional Health**

I didn’t see any results in my appearance until I had lost 15 pounds and had been dieting and doing *stupid* cardio for a month and a half. Other people saw it and complimented my weight loss and told me how great I was looking. I would half-heartedly take their compliments, but would get more frustrated because I wasn’t seeing the results they were.

I think I broke down crying to my boyfriend three times. I cried about how miserable I felt doing so much cardio, how tired I was at the end of the day from all the exercise, and how much I wanted some god damn chocolate cake wrapped in pizza. My emotions rode me like a rollercoaster and it sucked. I would get teary eyed so easily just *thinking* about how difficult this all was. In my head, I couldn’t win. I could either, break the diet and cardio and go back to being miserable about being fat…or I could keep being miserable about dieting and the cardio. But my boyfriend kept supporting me, and pushing me to keep to it. He was incredibly supportive and I don’t know what I would have done if he wasn’t there dragging me along kicking and screaming. But once I woke up one day, and saw how flat my stomach was…everything clicked. It all became worth it. I wore a tight mini skirt and sequin tank top (because we all know how those damn sequins show off every roll or stomach pooch) and I felt beautiful. I was happy.

The cravings sucked for the first month. I wanted pizza, pasta, bread and butter, cheese, and everything else you can imagine. But I eventually felt okay with not having those things. In fact when I had a slice of pizza with some friends, I had the worst stomach cramps afterwards. I felt gross. It tasted delicious, but man…I felt so horrible after eating it.

Now that my boyfriend is done with his competition, we have both been indulging in his favorite foods. But this time, now we *both* are wanting to get back to eating clean.

*Unexpected benefits:* I actually ended up saving a lot of money on groceries by eating this way. I ate everything I cooked up and almost never threw food out because it spoiled.

Anyway, that’s everything I could think of! If you have any questions, feel free to ask.


**EDIT:** I have lost 20 pounds in 2 months. I took a break from the regimen to graduate college, support my boyfriend at his bodybuilding competition, and eat nasty food with him afterwards. But this week I'm going back into the diet and cardio. 

I am training for a powerlifting competition that is happening in the middle-ish of June, and then to compete in a bodybuilding competition in late June.

I'm very new to tampons - 20 years old and I've only used them once so far (long story, revolving around a paralyzing fear of anything inside me, tampons in particular, that I've only just started to overcome). So, if this is a dumb question, please bear with me.

Can one do exercises such as squats and lunges with a tampon in? I've noticed that when I, er, go to the bathroom, the tampon kind of moves a bit, assumedly because of the bearing down. (Is that even supposed to happen?) I'm worried that when I'm lifting heavy, especially with squats, it's going to become dislodged and kind of...move down, is the best way I can put it, to a point where I can feel that it's not in the right place. I really don't want to be interrupting my workout and running to the bathroom in between sets to fix it...

I know that all sorts of female athletes use tampons, but since I've felt it move before...

**Edit/Update:** Thank you all SO MUCH for your help and advice! I honestly cannot even put into words how much more relieved I've felt after reading all your responses - for someone who has always been extremely fearful of tampons, it's been a tremendous help. I've just come back from the gym, doing a leg day, and things seem to have gone fine :).

You can find [Part 1 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/rwkax/athome_workout_part_1_abs_arms_back/) and [Part 2 here](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/s0pky/athome_workout_part_2_legs_glutes/). 

**Plyometric/Cardio** - All of these should be done landing lightly to protect your knees and these should be done as quickly without sacrificing form. 

-[**Burpees**](http://www.fitstream.com/en/us/exercises/burpees-a157) 

-[**Squat jumps**](http://site.hockeytrain.com/blog/hockey-leg-workout-tips-and-routine/) 

-[**Skaters**](http://www.faithfitnessfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/speedskaters.jpg) From a standing position, jump to your right and land on your right foot with your left arm reaching across your body like a speed skater. Then jump to your left and land on your left foot with your right arm reaching across your body. Try covering as much ground as you jump from side to side.

-[**Cone touches**](http://www.fit-pro.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=B81C02BB27E74CB6A10FF2BD394B52CA) I do these jumping from side to side and then reaching down and pretending I’m touching a cone hitting the same position as the guy in the picture.  

-[**Split squat jumps**](http://www.faithfitnessfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/poplunge.jpg) Start in a lunge position and jump up switching legs in the air. Softly land lowering down into a lunge on the alternate leg. This is one rep. 

-**Cross-country** - this is a modification to the split squat jumps. Start with your feet together. Jump and land with your right foot in front and your left arm up in the air. Jump and land with your left foot in front and your right arm up. A variation would have you bounce after you land.

-[**Tuck jump**](http://www.faithfitnessfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tuckjump.jpg) Jump up as high as you can and either tuck your knees back so that your feet are meeting your glutes or pulling them up in front of you towards your chest.

-[**Plie jacks**](http://www.faithfitnessfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/pliejack.jpg) Start in a low plié squat and jump up as high as you can while bringing your legs together in the middle. Land back in a plié squat.

-[**Downhill skiing**](http://www.faithfitnessfun.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/skihop.jpg) Stand with your feet together and bend slightly at the knees. Jump to the right and land softly with your feet still together and stick your butt out to the right like you’re a downhill skier. Jump back to your original position. 

-**Shuffle/basketball shoot** - Shuffle three times to the right and then squat down and jump up with your hands up like you’re about to shoot a basket with your right knee up to your chest and land on your left foot. Repeat on the opposite side. 

-[**High knees**](http://lcfellows.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/plyo-high-knees.jpg) From a standing position, jump up and raise your right knee in front of your body trying to get your knees as high as possible and then jump so that your left knee is in front as high as possible. Land lightly.

-[**Tire runs**](http://inchargefitnesscenter.com/bemidjis-outdoor-obstacle-course) I couldn’t find an actual picture of it, but basically pretend you’re going through tires like the ones in the picture in the link. You jump from one foot to another and move forward at the same time and when you run out of space you move backwards. 

-[**Butt kicks**](http://lcfellows.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/plyo-butt-kicks.jpg) From a standing position, jump and bend your right leg behind you so that your heel goes to your glutes as if you were kicking yourself in the behind. Then jump so that your left leg is behind you. 

-**Jump rope** - Pretend you’re jumping rope. You can also do variations where you jump on one leg several times and then switch, or you can just switch continually between the two legs, or you can do a little bounce every time you land between jumps.

-**Jumping jacks** - Standard jumping jacks, but you do a variation where you jump out and then jump up and land in that same out position before you jump with your legs back in where you jump in place again. 

-**Side jumps** - Not sure what the proper name for this is, but start in a squat position with your arms in front of you for balance. Jump to the right and land in a squat position with your left leg up and your arms still in front of you. Then jump to the left and land in a squat position with your right leg up.

I am 5'3"" and was near 180 lbs. I had made ""oh, let me start exercising"" resolutions before, but this time I really stuck.

A year ago, I was sad that I was getting too chubby for one of my favorite pairs of pants. [Now I have the opposite problem!!](http://i.imgur.com/1j4lv.jpg) I am going to have to retire them soon.

What I did:

* no drastic dietary changes (I wasn't doing things like drinking soda or eating fast food all the time anyway). Mostly just trying to be a bit more conscious about what/how much I was eating, and trying to cut down on things like desserts (my weakness!)
* July 10-Nov 10 -- couch to 5k running program. It took me at least 3 weeks to even get to week 1 of the program -- when I started, I couldn't even jog for 30 seconds!!
* Nov 10 -- the track that I was using closes at dusk, so with the time change, I wasn't able to get to it after work before it closed. Joined the local Y and started doing treadmill &amp; elliptical work.
* Feb 11 -- started lifting dumbbells
* June 11 -- started lifting barbells and doing the ""real"" lifts like squats and deadlifts


I was a size 14/16. Now I am, I think, a 10 (haven't bought clothes for a few months, but my 12s are loose) -- poooooossibly an 8, depending on brand. Last time I weighed myself (again, a few months ago) I was at 160. Now I would guess I am probably 150?? I don't pay very much attention to weight because I don't want to get too obsessed; I've been trying to concentrate on health and abilities instead for progress.

I have gained muscle and feel more competent in lifting things. (I've actually started insisting on carrying things and my husband jokes that I am ""strong like bull."") I've noticed that I can do things like run to catch up with someone without losing breath. I can do from-the-toes pushups!

I'm about to break 100lbs on my squat and I'm super-excited about that.

My starting flexibility was pretty poor, but I kept up with my practice, trying to dig a little deeper every time I struck a pose and focusing on form, but ultimately just enjoying the slow and steady improvements that yoga has been bringing to my life (both physically and mentally).

Fast forward to last night, a classmate of mine asked our instructor to include [wheel](http://www.yogajournal.com/poses/473) in the class. Once she showed it to us, my immediate thought was ""oh no way I can do that"", but I got into position thinking that I'd at least try. Got up up to the crown of my head and pushed through...bam!! full back bend, great height and form. And then I did it 2 more times, holding it steady and never forgetting my breath.

I could not do that type a bend when I was 7, and I certainly never thought I'd do it when I was 27. Just goes to show, when you stick to your practice (no matter what you do), amazing things start to happen.

Next stop headstand!! (Okay in time...Rome, nor a yogi, was built in a day.)

Then I graduated. Bye, bye free (relatively free) gym access.

One fattening holiday season later, I now live at home. I've been wanting to start serious weightlifting for a while (none of that light weight/high rep stuff I'd be doing before) but I had always been terrified of venturing into that area of the gym. What if I did something wrong? What if I took too long trying to find out my starting weight and someone yelled at me? What if I got laughed at? Trying things I had never done before in general makes me very, very nervous and shy. This looked too big for me to conquer. 

Anyways. Today I finally sucked it up. I wanted to go in to Planet Fitness, buy a membership (yeah I know, but it's cheap, I'm broke, and it's convenient) and start day one of [this](http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/the-muscle-building-workout-routine/) routine.

It's been about 4 1/2 months now. I've been doing Starting Strength this whole time and been getting some pretty good results. I don't do cardio workouts....but I lift 3 times a week.

**Before:** 
Here are my pics from late April 2012, about 2 weeks into working out (I didn't take any right at the start). May not be SFW because I'm wearing just bra and panties. Didn't take any flexing or any of my back....wish I had.

http://imgur.com/a/1nI9k

*Pre-pregnancy weight:* 145 lbs.

*Weight in April 2012:* 166 lbs.

Started out with the the barbell in most of my lifts. Worked mainly on Squats, Bench Press, Overhead Press and Deadlifts.
Eating habits....since I've been nursing, it's been experimental to say the least. I've heard that nursing ""burns"" 300-500 calories per day. So I started off pretty high and worked down to a level where I had enough energy to work out 3 times a week but was still losing. 

**After:** Here are my current pics. 

Also NSFW

http://imgur.com/a/WdIB6

*Current Weight:* 150 lbs

Current working sets (I do 3 sets of 5 at my working set per workout....so they are not my 1 rep maximums):

Squats: 160 lbs

Bench Press: 100 lbs

Overhead Press: 75 lbs

Deadlifts: 180 lbs

I am still nursing, but I'm taking in about 1800 calories per day. It seems to be a good level that allows me to lift but still lose fat. I don't have a specific diet, but I just try to eat within my caloric goal and not eat foods that are junky very often. 

Thanks for all of the support and advice xxfitness! Keep up the great work ladies!!

The inside of my thighs still touch and jiggle. So immediately after class I use the Hip Adductor machine. It is the only machine in the gym that specifically targets the inner thighs. 

So today after class I go to the section with the machines and someone is on it already. So I step aside to wait. But she is not using it, she is just texting. After about 10 minutes she notices me and asks if I am waiting for her. I smile and say ""I am, but I do not want you to feel rushed, please finish"" She then starts using the machine all super fast for about 30 seconds and then angrily grabs her things and storms off. Did not even wipe the machine down (not that texting works up a sweat).

So I get started when she comes back, sits on the machine next to me and keeps glaring at me in the mirror in between texts and random use of the machine she was on. 

So my question is this; is it wrong to wait right there for the machine? Should I have used something else in the meantime to not bother her even though that was the only thing I needed to complete my work out?

What I didn't realize is that it's required for women's athletic gear to either be: 

* So brightly colored that it can be seen from *space*. 

About half of the stuff I found was neon orange or yellow. I felt like a traffic cone in most of the stuff. I know that being visible while running outside is good but I think the emphasis on neon was a bit too much (for my taste, at least). 

* Short/revealing enough that you can't bend over in it.


I'm not one for modesty, but I don't like showing off my ass cheeks while running. Maybe I'm a unacknowledged prude though? 

* Tight enough to restrict breathing. 

I thought since all of the shorts seemed absurdly *short* I'd try some of those leggings on. Yeah, no. If I found them in an appropriate size, they were too tight on my thighs or belly (I HAVE WOMANLY HIPS! DAMN ME!). If I sized up, they sagged. 

If it's not one of those things, it's priced at eleventy billion dollars.

Forewarning: Lengthy post

I was always naturally skinny (staying around 112 lbs) and never had a real problem with my weight until I got to college. I would go to class from 8-11 and then nap from 12 until 6 just in time for dinner. Everyday. And on the weekends I drank obscene amounts of beer. So inevitably, I gained my freshman 15, my sophomore 15, and an extra 10 my junior year. It was the new year of my junior year when I realized how much weight I had actually gained (I tried for a long time to ignore it and say that it wasn't really that bad) and that I had to make a change. I was 150 lbs, the largest ever.

So I started with the iphone app Couch to 5k because I've never been physically active my entire life. I'm just so uncoordinated and just an all around bad athlete. I really liked this program because it does build up your endurance. The first time I had to run 5 minutes straight, I thought I was going to die. I followed the plan accordingly and went faithfully three times a week. I also would sporadically weight lift with my two guy friends but I never kept track and never really pushed myself too hard. I don't remember dieting too much either. But in five months, I lost about 20 pounds. 

I didn't even notice that I'd lost that much. When I first started, I was obsessed with weighing myself and got really defeated when I gained 2 pounds or only lost 1. So I stopped weighing myself. 

After getting to about 130 lbs I plateaued for about a year and a half. I didn't eat crazy and watched what I ate here or there. But I never really worked out. I gave up on C25K when I couldn't run a full 20 minutes without stopping and I stopped working out. 

October 2013: I started the Paleo diet and starting strength and lost about 5 pounds. I gave up after a month.

January 2013: I moved away from home and started a new job. I had a lot of free time after working my 8-5 so I decided that I shouldn't just be okay with the weight that I was at and that I needed to be productive so I joined the gym New Year's Day and started again with C25k from the beginning. (I since have completed the program and can run 30 minutes straight!)

From then, I got a little addicted to going to the gym and I wanted more. So I went back to starting strength so that I could spend more of my time at the gym. Alternating days, I would weight lift on one day then run the next.

**Beginning strength (Jan 2013):** 
    Standing Press: 35 lbs 3x10
    Squats: 95 3x10
    Bench: 45 3x10
    Deadlifts: 95 3x10

**Current strength (Apr 2013):**
    Standing Press: 45 5x5
    Squats: 145 5x5
    Bench: 65 5x5
    Deadlifts: 175 1x5

As you can see, I used to do low weights x high reps but I've since switched to the 5x5 method. I really want to work on gaining strength. Since January, I've gone from a size 6 to a size 2. I got down to 115 pounds (my lowest in 2 years). As of this moment, I'm going to try and start cutting so that I can get a six pack but my main focus is again, gaining strength and being able to bench my body weight and deadlift two times my body weight. 

Sorry for the lengthy post, but I just wanted to show that losing weight is a long process. It probably would've been faster for me if I hadn't plateaued and given up on myself but that happens. I give up on myself very easily. But now with weight lifting, you can see yourself grow slowly stronger and you can feel the muscles getting tighter. I love it. So keep it up girls! It's only a matter of time! I'm so sorry again for how long this is!

Since then I've been working out regularly and eating really healthy. Needless to say, I've put on a lot of muscle since then.

I'm happy with my body now, I guess. But I can't seem to get any lighter than 130 pounds or actually get any smaller. My legs are really strong, which might be why my lower body is so big.

 I am a 23 year old female and my breasts haven't ever been perky. I am the only ""amply endowed"" woman in my family, as I am sort of the short, wide-hipped type in a family of tall, lean, muscular women. (For reference--I am 5'7, which is pretty normal, I guess, but my mom and sister are right on the edge of 6'0"".) I was a fat kid, a chunky preteen, and a chubby adult just barely overweight. After working at exercising and eating right for a while, I'm barely not overweight. Unfortunately, my breasts are a far cry from being perfect and I'm worried that weight loss will only make them worse. They are moderately saggy for a 23 year old, but they are also super wide-set with large areolas. Apparently this is like a three for three terrible-things-to-have-going-on-with-your-boobs combo. My ex even requested that I keep my bra on during sex. :(


I have tried to read everything I can about how to correct this problem. Unfortunately, from what I have read, pec exercises can only help so much and most of the benefit seems to come from preventing breast sagging rather than correcting it. Apparently the only real solution is cosmetic surgery, which I don't think I'd ever be able to afford.


Have any of you, particularly you fittit ladies, ever dealt with this problem? Once and for all, what is the answer? Will pec exercises help push my girls up a bit? I have started learning how to use the bench press with the bar and while I am pretty (ha ha, very) physically weak, I am getting just a bit stronger all the time. Honestly at this point I don't care if my boobs get smaller and smaller--at least that way I'll have less to feel self-conscious about. Thanks again!


On a side note, I purchased Starting Strength very recently after all of my lurking here and I hope to keep on getting stronger!

EDIT: Thank all of you wonderful ladies for your kind and inspirational words. I am literally tearing up here. It is at least a bit reassuring to hear that my ex's preferences weren't totally OK (he used to get annoyed that I'd get emotional about him asking me to leave my bra on! In hindsight: what a dipstick). I guess I have to get to the point where I am more and more OK with my chest.

I took your advice and listened to your opinions, and I have not counted a single calorie since then. I still make sure I'm eating well and not overdoing it on ice cream and the like, but I listen to my body and what it wants, and calorie counting has gone out the window. I'm so much better for it. I've also started to do more weight-lifting (and cut back on the cardio), and I'm really seeing results! 

I stay away from the scale for the most part, but just today I decided I would go ahead and weigh myself just to see my progress. It's been a while since I last weighed myself - probably about a month. I had been expecting to have gained some weight - what with the lack of calorie restricting/dieting and the weight-lifting - but instead, I've maintained! Heck, I even lost two pounds.

So, here is a message to others like me: you don't have to count calories if you don't want to. If it does you more harm than good, stop! Stop, and just listen to your body. You can do it! 

Thanks, xxfitness, you gals are awesome.

Been lifting for 2+ years. No idea how long it's been out of place actually.

My gyn and I had a conversation about whether or not heavy lifting made an impact and we couldn't come to a conclusion. She's never had a patient who actually powerlifts (as in, squat 200+, deadlift 225+) and wasn't really sure but was willing to replace the one I have and see. She thought maybe if I am ""bearing down and pushing"" that might have an effect, but that's not really how one squats or deadlifts :) I also don't ever pee when I squat or deadlift and I have read articles online about other girls who do! So there's that.

Anyone else have an IUD and lift? Any issues? ~~My replacement IUD is probably going to cost me $400+ so I'm trying to decide if it's worth it~~ Looks like my insurance covers it now, so $0 to replace, hooray

Here's a bit of my background:

In high school I played tennis and soccer. During the tennis season I would go from tennis practice (2 hrs) to soccer practice (1.5 hrs) immediately after. Needless to say I was in great shape and wasn't self conscious in the least. After I graduated however, things changed. Depression hit (both parents had it so genetically I had a good chance of getting it), I wasn't exercising and eating as many calories as when I was in season. I gained 30 lbs in a little under a year. 

This summer, I had enough of the weight gain and lounging on the couch all day. I promised myself I would workout 6 days a week and try to curb my love for sweets and junk food. 

Now, two weeks in, I'm four pounds lighter and I feel great! I cut out soda completely and only drink water at restaurants. I wait to see if I really am hungry for seconds. My boyfriend has been a big help and even runs with me when I ask him to. 

MapMyRun.com has made a huge difference in my dedication to workout and trying not to eat as much. If you don't know what it is I highly recommend checking it out! 

I'm so excited I found this subreddit. I'm thinking it'll help motivate me even more!

I moved to a new place I never wanted to be in, became an agoraphobe, and to make matters worse, my job let me become increasingly sedentary. And I mean SEDENTARY, ladies-- for TWO YEARS. I used to run about 20 miles a week, and went to... well, nothing. Lots of shit happened to exacerbate this, but I'm sick of excuses. I need to get in shape, and nothing is gonna' stop me.

I'm picking up weightlifting. I'm using The new Rules of Lifting for women, and the first day has you doing step up lunges and squats on the same day. At home, I have no issue with ten pound weights, so I figured fifteen would be fine. Yes, it's an incredibly wussy weight. I'm really pushing up from nothing here. :(

After completing both the squats and step-ups, my legs became jelly-- AND THEY'VE BEEN JELLY FOR TWO DAYS. This was three days ago. I have muscle soreness, but no joint pain or feelings of injury. I'm just jelly-legged to high heaven here, and I'm only getting any real functionality from them back today.

I'm gonna' be honest-- this scared me. I've worked out tons in the past, but having put myself out so hard without hurting myself is really foreign to me, as well as horribly, horribly disappointing. I *will not* let this stop me, but what should I be doing right now? Should I let my legs keep resting up for a while-- at least until I get the strength in my knees back? What should I do to avoid overtraining like this so ridiculously in the future?

I'm sorry if this is a dumb question. I did a quick look over in the FAQ, so I hope I'm not asking something that's super readily covered. It probably is. Ugh, my bad.

Any insight, though?

TL;DR-- I was WAY more out of shape than I was expecting, which is... really disappointing, and I turned my legs into jelly. Can I speed up recovery? How can I avoid giving myself set backs like this in the future?",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_1h7r0r,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1h7r0r/embarrassing_but_please_help_me_i_seriously/,

When I joined the gym, I tried to make an appointment with a trainer to learn the lifts but couldn't match my schedule up with any of the trainers until today.  Until now, I've been getting a friend to spot me while I started doing them with light dumbbells to get the hang of everything and was planning on moving up to the 45 pound bar after being shown how to do them properly. 

I met with him for an hour and he made me feel like the weakest, crappiest person ever.  Everything he said seemed to completely contradict SS - no squats beyond parallel, toes forward not turned out, looking up towards the ceiling during deadlifts and squats, etc.  He wouldn't even show me how to use the squat cage, bench press or overhead press because I 'wasn't ready' which may be true, but felt so condescending.  We talked a lot about core strength, which I know I need to work on but after an hour of doing the lifts his way, my back is killing me.  He told me that I shouldn't even attempt a back squat until I can plank for 90 seconds. 

I feel really upset because I joined the gym to empower myself and feel strong after a sexual assault.  And until today, it had been going great.  I thought that going to someone in person would be better than just watching youtube videos and readings SS but now I don't know who is right and feel nervous to even try any of the lifts again.  I also feel weird going back to the gym because if he sees me doing them Rip's way, I think he will assume I'm dumb or weak or something.  He wasn't a douche or anything but he did make me feel weak, the precise feeling I have been working so hard to change!  So frustrated!!!

Unfortunately I have absolutely no money so I can't purchase a book telling me what to do. I am really really interested in SS but the info I found online kind of confused me. But I wasn't going to let that stop me so I asked a guy who worked at the gym to show me how to squat and whatnot and what his routine was etc.

He told me something I bet a lot of you have heard before: ""I wouldn't lift heavy unless you want to get bulky"" ""women should do more reps at a lower weight""....I had to stop my eyes from rolling and subsequently glaring at him with the intensity of a flaming hawk. 

He would only let me do the bar at first (Which I understand) but then he said I should look at the ceiling (which I have heard contested) and he told me just to use the bar for a while

the problem being the bar alone does absolutely nothing for me whatsoever and I'm not even remotely tired after over 15 reps...?

So today I went in and he wasn't there so I put ten pounds on each side and I did 5x5...that was fairly easy too so I figure I'll go up next time...but then I was stuck...what do you do after you do front squats? Other squats?What are your leg days like? after I squatted I just went to the dumbells and did plie squats and front lunges/reverse lunges with 20-30 lb dumbbells at each side like I used to do when I worked out...then I was stuck again and I couldn't think of anything else to do with my legs...so I worked my abs and then did cardio...

what should I do? This sounds moronic, I apologize...I have read the fitness faq and everything but everyone seems to have such a drastically different routine and I'm not precisely sure what I'm doing

not to mention I""m the *only* woman in the weight room every single time I'm in there O.O that's intimidating enough haha, I'm terrified of fucking up 

if I attempt deadlifts on my own after watching a demonstration video am I likely to hurt myself? do I do deadlifts like squats set-wise? what do I start with...? 

before I went to college all I had access to was 15 lb dumbbells and those were far too easy for me squat/lowerbody wise so I did a TON of jump squats of several variations...but I feel like I a lunatic if I do that in the gym...and I have no desire to do that anymore

so yes...I'm really new to this...does anyone have any tips for me...or an exact routine they can link me to?

I've had a very shitty year. I went through a devastating break-up (because he cheated...he was also not very nice to me and was harsh about my body). Throughout the relationship, I struggled with an eating disorder and got to a very low weight. Now, through binging and depression, I've gained all the weight back and then some. I'm in a pattern of binging, purging, and starving that needs to stop. I want to feel confident again. I want to feel beautiful. Unless I start taking care of my body, I'll never feel good about myself again.

So, tomorrow morning, I start. I've been dabbling in running but my binge eating has kept me from improving and losing weight. But I'm determined for all of that to change. I've deleted my Facebook, found a training plan, and am going to follow a 1,200 calorie diet. I'm also going to sign up for some 5Ks around campus to keep me motivated.

I took a little weight off the bar (not that there's much on there anyway! haha) and started another set. And halfway through, there he was again. I thanked him again, and that was that. I don't think he even said anything, he just nodded and smiled.

I, for one, think this is not only counterproductive, but also very condescending to other women who choose not to lift. It's almost like saying: ""I'm not like other women, I'm better because I lift and you are a dumbass for not being aware of this fact."" I have never lifted heavy until recently, but I have been blessed with a very athletic and strong body. I don't remember ever having any difficulty lifting heavy boxes, moving heavy object, picking people up, etc. As a result, I have never been treated differently than guys. My guy friends don't offer to carry my shit, they actually call me over to help them, and are not surprised to see me go to the gym and pick up some heavy weights.

You are breaking the stereotype just by going to the gym and picking up the weights, regardless of your gender. We do not need to feel empowered for lifting anymore just as we don't need to feel empowered for working. The reason why this is true is because it has become the norm and women who work are no longer setting a precedent.

So after a really upsetting week last week, where I bloated right up and all my measurements skyrocketed while my lifts plummeted, I reached the inevitable conclusion that it was my period causing the problems. Sure enough, **this has been a firecracker week!**

Measurements:

- 5'8"" (172cm): just for reference.. believe it or not this stat hasn't budged ;-)
- My weight has dropped to 63.5kg (140lb): that's a bit over 1kg (around 2-3lb) lost since I started, while eating at maintenance (+200 on lifting days)
- Waist: 70cm (down 1cm or a half inch)
- Hips: 97cm (down 0.5cm)

Looking at those measurements, and comparing with the photos - I think it's clear that I'm mostly gaining muscle. I'm not sure where the 1kg has come off, but I have noticed (and you'll see in the photos below) that all of my underwear is getting really loose. How this could be the case from such a small loss from my hips is confusing but I'm just accepting and enjoying it! 

Current nutrition:

- Still 90% paleo
- 2050kcal on non-lifting days, 2250kcal on lifting days
- Macro split: Aiming for 25% carbs, 35% protein, 40% fat. 
- The above translates into about 130-140g carbs, 90-100g fat, 170-180g protein: though of course this all varies day-to-day. If anything, I tend to go under on carbs and over on fats.

**[Photos: Week 0 to Week 5](http://imgur.com/a/uyJdB) (NSFW - underwear)**

Notes/Achievements:

- On Sunday I will be completing my final workout for Stage 1! I'll then do the two bonus workouts before taking a rest week and then starting on Stage 2. I can't wait! As many people have complained about before, the first stage can be really repetitive and long. I'm looking forward to changing it up.
- I have new back dimples! Can you see them? So proud!
- I realised **my squat weight was going backwards because I've been focussing on better form** and going lower. I reset on my last workout to just 24.5kg and will start working up from there again. It sucks to deload that much, but it's necessary to getting this right.
- My rows and my lat pulldowns are finally moving up. Rows in particular have finally shifted to the next weight section, from 34kg (75lb) to 41kg (90lb) at 8 reps. 
- **I can finally do full, nose-to-ground push-ups!** I've been doing them on an incline (on a low bench) for 2 weeks so I thought it was time I gave the full ones a proper crack. I managed 3 before failing on my fourth and completing the reps on the bench again. 
- I'm really happy with the definition coming up on my stomach and my arms. I can really clearly see when I flex my abs now, and when I'm doing dumbbell presses my shoulders look boss. 
- On a similar note, I've always had small shoulders and a bottom-heavy (pear) frame, so it's really nice seeing my body balance out a bit more.
- Overall as you can see in the photos, **although my actual dimensions haven't changed much, the difference in body composition is really awesome.**

* 2x15 narrow stance hip thrusts (these were killer)
* 2x15 wide stance hip thrusts (Thank goodness no one could see me!)
* Hamstring, glutes, and quad stretching for 10 minutes

This took me about an hour to complete and I was shaking afterwards. Also, I was sent a sample thermogenic called Dexaprine with my creatine order and was trying that out. It's very strong (I used half) but I did decide to order it, it made a big difference in my workout performance.

He's currently in another country so not here to do the lifting with me, but I sent him some pics of the apartment gym and he wrote me up a 3-day routine to ease me in. He's bemoaned the fact that we have very little in the way of machines (couple treadmills and a recumbent bike, and two weight machines) and no barbells, but we do have a lot of dumbells so my routine is based on using the free weights. 

I did day one this morning, and I know I'm not lifting as much as some of you ladies, but I'll get there eventually.  He's advised I ask about protein powders for supplementing my diet.  

I have used Myoplex in the past.  I liked some of their flavors, but you really needed a blender to make it something you could drink.  I also know from the past that if I need a blender for it, it wont get used, because you have to wash the blender several times a day, and it takes time to make it.  I'm much better at adding protein if it comes RTD, or if it will mix easily in a shaker and not be all kinds of grainy.  

So, give me your best protein recommendations.  Links to where to buy are also very welcome.

But I was told I was using paper weights and wouldn't see any results with them.  I'm not sure what this person (assuming a man) thought a good starting weight was, but 3 lbs is surprisingly a lot for me.  I was also told that if I wanted to bulk up I'd have to do more than I had planned.  I said nothing in my post about bulking up. I clearly stated I was a 35-year-old female, 5'3"", 202 lbs, looking to do resistance training along with cardio to lose weight (to correspond with my new healthy diet of all natural foods, where I've lost 20 pounds in 3 months, but hit a plateau and looking to shock my system to lose again), so I can only assume the person responding skipped that part of my post and assumed I was a guy looking to become more muscular.  The third person to respond told me I just needed to read the FAQs and not to waste time with these questions.  I read the FAQs, but they are mainly geared towards men, which wasn't helping me at all, and I had a very specific question and not looking for general information.

My friend: is losing weight by drinking these GNC Lean shakes and is losing weight rather quickly. She is not working out at all, and swears by drinking two of these shakes a day. She's down 2 sizes in 2 months.

Me: Works outs 3-4x a week for 90+ minutes a session. Weight training, watching what I eat for the last 2 months. Have not actually lost any weight, but I am down a total of 6"" overall. I am down a pant size.

It's frustrating to no end to see her get tons of compliments about her weight loss, and hear her just ramble on and on about how easy it is. We have a customer who makes a big fuss over her every time she comes into the store and how she loves coming in to see how tiny she's gotten. I've gotten ONE compliment on my efforts. I know I shouldn't care because I'm doing this for ME, but it's discouraging to know I'm busting my ass and she's just drinking this f*&amp;^ing shakes and it's falling off. My only consolation is that when she stops the shakes and starts eating again she will put it all back on. 

A lot of the women I work with are doing the shakes and the weight is coming right off. None of them are exercising. I'm starting to lose my confidence in my self. I was/am proud of myself for working hard to lose this weight,but it's so slow moving I'm losing motivation. 

So essentially my question is, how can I deal with the jealous/envy/disappointment I am feeling when people compliment other people who I know are taking the easy way out?

I started working out at the end of May, and I've noticed slight changes to my body.  However, you know how the saying goes, abs are made in the kitchen.  Oddly enough my pizza, burgers, french fry, pasta, and only drinking soda diet doesn't really help my fitness goals.  I'm pretty happy with my body the way it is, so that's always been my excuse for not eating healthy.  However I'm waking up at 5:00 in the morning so I can get into better shape, and the only thing keeping me from a great, fit body is junk food.

Today I actually remembered that I'm trying to eat healthy.  I know that sounds kinda dumb, but usually I get really excited at night then completely forget the next day and wind up eating crap.  I have previously gone to the grocery store with a planned out list, bought tons of healthy food, gone home and made one meal, gone to sleep, then never touched the healthy stuff again.

But today, I made it through breakfast eating a peach and a protein shake.  Then, I was supposed to go to the cafeteria for lunch, but was redirected to the food court.  I have free lunch where I work, so it's always difficult for me to pass up free Chick-fil-a or pizza.   Of course at that point I had gotten hungry and my mind was screaming ""pizza!"" However I made myself walk over to the salad station and made a spinach salad with mushrooms and carrots.  I've made it all day without drinking any of the free soda or (even harder) Starbucks coffee drinks. 

I know it sounds silly small, but it is a really big deal for me. It's a total shift in the way I was thinking, because I used to say ""I'll happily run an extra hour so I can eat my cake with dinner"".

I'm pretty excited about it, though I haven't actually exercised much since high school (over a decade ago, eeek!).

My problem is that I have --ahem-- quite a bit of junk in my trunk, if you catch my meaning. I had some former coworkers who affectionately (or at least I hope it was affectionate) call it my ""J.Lo butt"" (disclaimer: my butt is the only thing I have in common with J.Lo).

In normal circumstances this is no problem. A plump behind is excellent for most butt-required actifities, such as sitting. However, I have discovered that it is a bit of a problem when I are trying to run. Or jog. Or move at any pace above walking. The problem is the jiggle. My heinie (and thighs) are entirely too active when I run. It's uncomfortable and distracting. (And on cold days it can be *painful*.)

Now, a good sports bra will keep my girls in place, but what am I gon' do with all that junk in my trunk? Are there any booty-stabilizing sports undies out there? If so, what are they called and where would I find them?

I was originally just looking for motivational pictures of strong, muscular women to help me stay in the gym and start working out with weights seriously, but then I became intrigued at how all of these women had pretty much the same physique: Large boobs, rock hard/flat abs, large toned butts. [Large](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mapdxuBNRb1rsftapo1_500.jpg) [large](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7z8metiQs1r1n07ho1_500.png) [large](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m7q91mN6Gr1rpfztqo1_500.jpg) [boobs](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lymap5PFwx1qh851po1_500.jpg). How? How is that even possible? 

Am I just ill-fated? Because I don't know about you guys, but my boobs are basically non-existent...even without a sports bra. At first it didn't even click, I thought that the women in these pictures, all of whom probably have 18% or less body fat, must all just have better genes than I do. Then it hit me: plastic surgery and breast implants. Yes, that seems to be the only explanation. Huge ass silicone sacks in place of their natural boobs. But...Why? What the heck? Don't they work out to achieve a stronger, more capable body? Shouldn't they be proud of the muscles they have earned? Why do they need to change their bodies more? Is this what a strong woman's body is supposed to look like? Minimal amounts of body fat, but still maintaining huge lady curves? There is no way that all of us can achieve that naturally. I'm not hating on these women because they may have chosen to get cosmetic surgery, nor am I insinuating that I don't think that they look good. I have a problem with the way society seems to subtly pressure this kind of 'ideal' shape for women.

If you guys follow fitness videos on youtube, then you've probably heard of BodyRockTV. When the host Zuzana left, they got new girls. One of whom, is this [chick](https://fbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/432105_395430547150521_1969985108_n.jpg). She's fit and pretty- fine, whatever.

Why did they feel the need for her to change her body when she was beautiful before the surgery?

Things have been going well and we've been making steady gains.  My girlfriend got interested and decided to join us.  

Her stats: Age 26, height 5'9"", weight ~165lb

She has never lifted or done any kind of strength training.  She has been sedentary for about the past 8 months and is very weak/inflexible.  She's come to the gym twice now and we've run into an issue: there are only olympic 45lb bars.  She can bench the bar for 3x5 with some difficulty, so that's OK.  She can deadlift with 5kg rubber plates, which is also good.  However, squatting the bar is very difficult, to the point where she can't really develop good form.  Also, doing overhead press is not going to happen with a 45lb bar.

What can we do to work her up to being able to squat and press the bar?  I got her to do OHP with 10lb dumbells for 3x5 (which she found challenging but doable).  Is that a good idea?  What about squatting?  Should she be doing bodyweight squats?  Gobblet squats?

I keep pretty fit and active, but I want to run.  I thought I was doomed to never be able to really run, just plod along behind my friend gripping the stitch in my side.  We signed up for a 5k, I was so unprepared, but when the time came I did it and I did fairly well.  I was shocked!  The race was at 6pm, and since then I've tried running later in the day and I can go much farther and faster than I ever could if I went in the morning.

Trouble is, all my free time is in the morning.  Should I like...eat a bunch of food before bed so I wake up fueled?  Should I drink water?  Should I not drink water?  My main issue is I get a horrendous stitch in my side, and I just ain't the kind of person to push through that sharp of a pain, especially since it doesn't go away and stay gone.

I see people doing it, I know it can be done!  How do you run in the morning??

EDIT:  Woke up at 6:30, drank some water with a splash of gatorade in it, had a piece of toast with butter and honey and wandered the house, stretched and read your responses until 7:30.  I ran 1 1/2 miles in 30 minutes, and had only brief twinges of stitches.  I think if I work at this I can up my pace and conquer my stitches.  I felt much better with a little bit of a snack in me before I went, and I think the fact that I ran alone (well, the dog came with) and was only trying to keep up with myself and not trying to impress anyone really helped me keep my pace at something manageable.  

My plan I think will now be to wake up at 6, but lay around and just drink my water and not really get up until my usual 6:30, and eventually that will turn into me actually getting out of bed and functioning at 6.  I'll run for a half hour every other morning and every other evening, and see where that takes me.

It involved a fitness issue but feel free to delete if it's misplaced!

Quick background: I used to go to the gym and be useless. 10 minutes cardio, 10 minutes wandering staring at machines and 10 minutes ""stretching"" aka touching my toes and doing some arm circles. Then home and cake time.

Then I met my current boyfriend. He was a friend of a friend and I got him a job at my gym. He started helping out with my workouts, introduced me to crossfit, etc. We ended up dating, falling mmmadddlllyyy in love and now live together. He just opened a crossfit gym with a friend recently and business is great! I train there with him and my fitness journey has been going incredibly well! I'm SO MUCH stronger, have lost weight and for the first time ever love my body!

HOWEVER: here's the downside. I typically hit the gym after work, then the two of us drive home. By the time I get home I'm sweaty, tired and not in the mood for anything. He's also usually wiped, but like most men, ready at any moment for some action. Despite the fact that I WANT to have sex with him, love him, enjoy it, etc...I'm just SOOO tired. On arm days I can't lift my arms over my head for instance because they're so sore! Plus, I'm sweaty so I'd like to shower. But I also like to shower after sex. So I get this ""shower conundrum"" where I don't want to shower twice in such a short time span but I feel too gross to have sex post gym! My little brother is also crashing on our couch for the time being, which means showering at random times at night is more difficult since I have to cross the living room to get to the bathroom!

It feels like such a stupid problem since we have NO issues on non gym days! But with him working at the gym, us only having one car, etc our schedule ends up having lots and lots of gym days! The sex on those non-gym days is MUCH better than before since I'm a lot more confident about how I look and much more comfortable with myself. 

I just feel bad because I don't want him to think I don't want to be with him. Any one else experienced this?",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_1j9uqs,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1j9uqs/getting_fitter_has_negatively_affected_my_sex_life/,

I started off not being able to jog a mile and a half and now I can confidently run 3 miles. I run 5-6 times a week, with a cross training day or two fit in there.


So this is where my question comes into play: The other day at my gym I got my body fat percentage checked because I was curious if it had changed. (It had been checked halfway through my jogging class) Of course the trainer at the gym who checked it for me used the opportunity to ask what I was doing, what my goals were, and if I would ultimately be interested in signing up for training sessions. When I told him I had only been jogging he immediately was like, ""No. No more jogging. No running. Not good."" 


I want to know what you all think about running and whether it's good to do. I understand there are chances for injury on joints, and running alone isn't going to build muscle, which is why I am also starting to lift a few days a week with my friend.

Long story short, I went and got some bloodwork done. The doctor asked me a lot about my habits and I told her basically the same things I said. Here's a summary:

1) I started with Whole 30 for 3 months back in October of 2012. After that, and up to about a couple of weeks ago, I ate 80% paleo 100% of the time. 

2) I do not eat gluten/wheat/bread products as they make me get an incredibly upset stomach and bloat. Have not been tested officially (which I let oc know, she didn't seem to care) but they make me feel bad so I avoid them.

3) I crossfit 2x/week and walk the other days. 

4) While I have a desk at my job, I am rarely in it unless I am typing a report for a half hour.

5) I do not eat fast food, soda, or processed sugars. EVER.

6) I eat very limited dairy.

7) I cook every meal from scratch and do my best to use locally grown, organic ingredients. Or grass fed meats.

8) I calorie count, and eat about 1500-1700 calories a day.

She sent me for tons of tests. They all came back fine--EXCEPT my cholesterol, which was THROUGH THE ROOF at 261. LDL and HDL were terrible too. The TSH came back at 2.44 She basically told me...don't eat so much junk food/soda and exercise a lot more. She also told me, when I wanted to discuss my results, that the standard answer she gave me was canned and that I should just ""take what suited me"" from them.

I'm so frustrated and upset. CLEARLY I am unhealthy and in danger of becoming more so. I'm only 23 and I take better care of myself than so many people. Why am I so unhealthy and WHAT can I do?!? ANd why the sweet baby jesus does my doctor think I'm lying? Just because I am fat?

I've been running for about 4-5 years now, and for a long time it was my primary form of exercise. Ran a half-marathon 2 years ago at a 10:48 pace, then a 10k last autumn at a 9:40. I thought I was in great cardio shape. When my mom asked if I wanted to run the half with her this year, I agreed right away, thinking at least it'll be motivation to train.

This winter, I discovered Starting Strength and loved it. I began squatting almost every day, deadlifts/OHP on workout A days and bench/power clean on workout B days. My numbers were going up and I was looking great. I inwardly scoffed at the cardio zombies on the ellipticals and treadmills at my gym. I thought I could do more in 25 minutes than they did in their stupid hour.


Now my half is a month away and I began running seriously again a week ago...and it's been a nightmare. Every day I've gotten worse. I can't run under a 10 minute pace for more than 2 miles, and I can't run more than 4 or 5 without stopping. My legs feel like lead right away and it's agony to keep going. It seems like every time I go out I get worse, and it is an incredibly humbling experience. I thought I was in great shape, and now I'm about ready to give up on this half. I'm all for pushing myself but I don't think it's possible that I'll be ready.


I just wanted to volunteer this from the powerlifting-fan camp. Running is hard as fuck and even those of you who lift and think you're in great shape might get your ass kicked by a surprisingly short run. Something to think about. If you're just in it for the numbers, maybe this isn't relevant to you, but for those of you who want to generally be in good shape, take warning from someone who woefully neglected her cardio.


I probably won't be able to squat 130 next time I go in or bench 80 (yep, that's as high as it ever got; upper-body strength is still an issue for me) but at least I'll know that I'm getting back in shape -- and what does ""in shape"" mean if not ""able to endure extended periods of strenuous activity""? some of you may disagree but I think that's a damn good way of defining it.

My tiny lizard brain is telling me if I eat more, then I'll just get heavy again, which is all sorts of wrong.

Right now this is what my work outs consist of:

**Arm day:**

Bench press

Upright rows

Shrugs

ez bar curls

lat pull down

occasional push ups

Leg raises


**Leg Day:**

Squats or deadlifts

weighted calf raises

Leg extensions

Leg curls

Leg raises

They way I lift (and correct me if I should be doing it a different way, but I feel good doing it this way) is I start with the lightest weight, and work my way up by 10 or 15 lbs a set until I reach my 5RM, and then work my way back down again. 5 reps each set)
I lift every other day, and I'll some times throw in some running (no less than 2 miles) on my non lifting days. 

**Maxes:**

Bench: 100

Deadlift: 170

Squat: 135

Push ups: 42

I eat clean, and relatively low carb (below 100g), and try to get at least 100G protein in me a day, I'm just not sure HOW MUCH to eat to lose inches of fat while gaining solid muscle. I don't give a shit about the scale anymore, just about my physic and fitness.

Thanks, guys. I feel really lost, and am not sure how to proceed, and I figured coming here would be my best bet.

I saw this and though that a lot of women one here would benefit from it. I see a lot of people on the sub start out weight training with SS or SL or some other beginner program and achieve less than impressive results. I think the read below addresses the mindset one needs to really follow a LP program and if nothing else start a conversation about pushing oneself. So without further ado, the post:*


Someone gifted me gold for this comment in a different thread, and I thought it could use some more exposure. I cleaned this up a little bit from my earlier post. Hopefully people who are stuck in the limbo of constantly resetting fairly low weights can derive some inspiration from this. I ran SS for 3.5 months starting last February. I probably could have realized slightly higher gains had I kept eating, but I was so exhausted by the program that I stopped. Here are my SS stats in the format Stat: 

Before SS -&gt; After SS (sorry, too lazy to put everything in kg):

Age: 23 -&gt; 23

Height: 5'9"" -&gt; 5'9""

Weight: under 130lbs -&gt; 150lbs

Lifts:

Squat: 135x3x5 (too high, couldn't walk right for two weeks) -&gt; 225x3x5

Bench: 95x3x5 -&gt; 155x3x5

Deadlift: 160x5 -&gt; 275x3

OHP: 55x3x5 -&gt; 105x3x5


So I had fairly typical results for 3 1/2 months of SS for a healthy (albiet very skinny) male. I had my share of stalls and form issues, but in the end hard work prevailed. This is mainly written for people on some sort of linear progression strength training program (SS, SL, GSLP, whatever), but really the fundamentals can be applied to many facets of life. Here's my (slightly edited) post that hopefully helps some people out:


Don't forget, linear progression is fucking hard as balls after a bit. You're going in to the gym and hitting a new max every single workout. Every...single...workout... On every...single...lift... That shit gets really hard physically and mentally.


At some point you're going to have to make a choice. It's probably not going to be black and white, but creep up on you over several sessions. You're going to have to choose whether you're going to wimp out because lifting is hard, flop around, and join the mediocrity parade. Or, you're going to get a little crazy twitch in your eye, crank your music a little louder, and bang out that one more set. Those last three reps. That one last god-forsaken pull off the floor.


Eventually, you will miss a lift. This is the inevitable truth of linear progression. You won't stand up after that squat rep. The deadlift will refuse to come off the floor. The barbell will staple you to the bench, and you'll meekly utter ""...spot?"" Then what? You'll reset and work back up. You'll meet your nemesis again. Perhaps it's the 200lb squat. Perhaps it's a 135 bench. Maybe it's that goddamned 275 deadlift you thought was going to kill you last time. Whatever it is, you'll hit the same weight.
This is the test. This is going to separate success from failure. Strength from mediocrity. You from people who quit every time something gets difficult. Most would assume they can just coast through their old stalls, and they will try. They will then come here and post about how they've ""plateaued"" at a 140lb bench press. How they ""cannot"" squat over 205lbs. How they're ""scared"" to deadlift heavy. But not you. You know it's going to take work, and you're willing to put in that work. You know this is going to be heavy. You know you've been beaten here before. But this time is different.


This time, you've got just a little bit of crazy in you. That spark of determination when you really want something. This time, you KNOW you're standing up from the bottom of the squat. You KNOW that bench is coming off your chest. You've already decided you're finishing your deadlifts come hell or high water. You grit your teeth, strain against the weight, and lockout that final rep.
And when that happens, you'll know you've changed. You'll know you're no longer mediocre. Next time you stall, you'll already know what you have to do. You'll realize the next workout can't get here fast enough. And you will no longer be weak.


So that about sums up my experience with linear progression. The shit sucks real bad after a bit. Suck it up, sack up, and do it without complaining.


My last bit of advice for those nearing the end of linear progression would be to have some sort of ""next step"" planned, and stick to it. I dicked around between TM and madcow after finishing SS, and didn't stick with either one for very long. I made pretty poor progress in the 3 months immediately following SS, before I made up my mind to just stick with TM for more than 6 weeks. You might not think you're hurting your progress, but now I'm almost a year out from February with lifts not as high as I would like.

I just squatted a sun bear (plus a small cat haha) for the first time! My last rep was a little rough and I had to pause at the bottom, but I made it back up :)

This is a major milestone for me... I started NROLW about four weeks ago (this was my 5th Workout A for anyone that knows that program) and I was too scared to even try to squat the bar. I started with one of those 18 pound body bars, then the next workout I found the courage to go into the ""heavy corner"" of my gym where they cluster all the racks, and now a few weeks later I just feel like a total badass! My deadlifts have progressed from the bar alone to 115lbs, too, which I am just so excited about. I know that most of my progress is just from learning how to do the lifts properly, but I also had to learn how to not give a shit about what all the guys were thinking and just push myself to my limits. That's been the hardest part!

Anyway, in these four weeks I've actually gained 2 pounds (5'8''/142), but I've lost an inch off my waist and I just feel so much better. I jumped right in to weightlifting from a 1200 calorie/day diet with unlimited cardio, and the difference in my energy levels now that I'm eating 2000+ calories a day is amazing. I'm still working on getting over the guilt of eating so much, but I'm starting to realize that I need to fuel my body if I'm going to make any progress. And if you told me four weeks ago that I was going to look forward to going to the gym, I'd call you crazy!

And it is an up hill battle at the moment. 


My body works against me (I have hypothryoidism that has been under medicated by an older doctor and while new doctor is adjusting the medication it does have to be done slowly). 


I am walking a fair bit these days. I'm adding in yoga and strength training. I've got myself some light weights (I'm starting with 2lbs because my 5lbs ones dislocate my shoulders). 


I told my partner about the changes I am trying to make to my life. He thinks it is in my head and that I don't need to drop any weight. So I tell him I am trying to eat healthy and he brings home 11 Cadbury Cream eggs for me. Under our living room table he has stashed:

Orange candy slices. 
Gummy worms. 
Ferriro Rochier (large box) 
Wine Gums
100 g bar of Cadbury Chocolate
A large bag of jelly beans. 
A large bag of dark chocolate almonds. 

In the cupboard we have:
Doritos 
Regular Chips
All dressed chips. 
Chocolate chip cookies. 

Daily he texts me to say we can just order a pizza instead of cooking. 


He also has a habit of buying beer. He doesn't drink. I have a soft spot for coming home tired from work and drinking beer. I have tried telling him not to buy any (I'm not buying any). I don't want it in the house at all because it's too easy to come home and have one or two. 

We had an unopened case in the fridge and tonight we had guests. Once a week I make dinner for our friends. Tonight he bought an extra case so now we have a case and a half (because barely anyone drinks beer). And of course the beer he brings home is an imported case of one of my favs. I feel like he is trying to set me up for failure.  

I am trying so hard to have will power and to make healthy choices about what I am putting into my body. But at this point I am hoping the gastroentronologist that I am going to see in the summer puts me on an elimination diet so that I can reasonably ban all this stuff from our common areas and push it into his office. 

I do keep having this conversation with him and he apologizes and stops buying me junk for a few days and then it starts again.

What can I do? How can I get myself to stop being so sad and go back to the gym?",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_1jvng2,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1jvng2/advice_having_a_hard_time_getting_back_in_the_gym/,

For context, I am currently an au pair in Italy for the summer. I just graduated college, and gained about 20 lbs over the course of those 4 years (though most of it was in the last year due to too much socializing and booze!). 

I was relatively active in college at the gym (played rugby and worked out semi-regularly), but also very active on the social scene. 

In the month post-graduation, I lost 10 lbs fairly easily just by not drinking alcohol or late-night munching. But now that I'm being hosted by an Italian family, I don't have ANY control over what I eat. Being northern Italians (who also own a restaurant!), they eat A LOT of pasta, cheese, fatty meats, and desserts. Very carb heavy, very vegetable/fruit scarce. Of course, I've tried to limit by portion sizes and refuse unhealthy foods when I can, but it is considered very rude to refuse food in the Italian culture, and I often don't have a choice, they just put it on my plate. 

I don't have access to a gym or weights here (this is a very small town on the Italian riviera) but I've taken up light jogging and swimming when I can, and am working on increasing my frequency/pace. Nevertheless, I've plateaued at 146 lbs, and would like to be at 130-ish when I get back to the States in September, and reunite with my boyfriend with a sexy new bod! 

Do you have any tips or tricks to breaking through the plateau and shedding the extra 16 lbs over the next 10 weeks that doesn't necessarily have to do with diet? 

EDIT: Thank you all for your wonderful suggestions! I am going to continue to jog 6 days a week, and try to incorporate more bodyweight exercises at the rest benches along the path I use. I also had a brief conversation with the family that my stomach was getting upset a lot (indigestion) and I would really appreciate if there were more fruits and vegetables available. Now I usually get to eat breakfast and lunch on my own, and eat a lot more low-fat yogurt, hard-boiled eggs, veggies and fruits! I feel that I can definitely make some good progress in the next 10 weeks now!

&gt;**Weightlifting Performance Standards Tables**

&gt;The standards presented in the following tables represent a performance
that can be reasonably expected of an athlete at various levels of training
advancement using standard full range-of-motion barbell exercises. 

&gt;In the tables above, the term **""untrained""** refers to the expected level of strength in a healthy
individual who has not trained on the exercise before but can perform it
correctly. This represents the minimum level of strength required to maintain a
reasonable quality of life in a sedentary individual. 

&gt;**""Novice""** means a person training regularly for a period of 3-9 months. This strength level supports the
demands of vigorous recreational activities. 

&gt;An **""intermediate""** is a person who has engaged in regular training for up to two years. The intermediate level
indicates some degree of specialization in the exercises and a high level of
performance at the recreational level. 

&gt;The term **""advanced""** refers to an individual with multi-year training experience with definite goals in the higher levels of
competitive athletics. 

&gt;The term **""elite""** refers specifically to athletes competing in
strength sports. Less than 1% of the weight training population will attain this
level.

**[Follow me on Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/Dodge87)**

**Update on the cut:**

- The cut is going really well, and is really solidifying to me how far I've come with regards to calorie tracking and controlling what my body can do and look like.
- This week saw the end of exams for the semester, so I had a 3200 calorie day, almost half of which was alcohol. Seeing as I've only had about 5 standard drinks this year before that, I'm not beating myself up over it. I don't often get to drink so I had my fun with my friends and now I'm trucking along.
- That said, before the drinking day I had managed to cut extremely well - getting all the way down to 62.3kg (that's a loss of around 2kg or almost 4lbs) in just under 2 weeks. I guess eating at maintenance for a while meant that **my body really responded to the calorie cut**. I've been eating 1700 which isn't a huge deficit but it's been a great response.
- It shot back up to 63.8kg in the two days after drinking - which says to me that I was dehydrated and my body was reacting to the huge calorie intake. 
- It's now back down to 63.3 so heading in the right direction again.
- **More importantly than the scale are my measurements: ALL of which have started dropping** again and are breaking my own records, including finally falling *just* below 70cm (27.5"") for waist - which has been a goal of mine for a while.

**I think the impact of the cut is starting to become clear in [these NSFW progress photos](http://imgur.com/kFvIO0x)** 

*(Please note that I am kinda cheating by wearing a push-up bra in the last set of photos, my boobs definitely haven't grown and yes I know the bra band is too big.)*

**My failure Friday**

- I posted these in the weekly thread but due to time zones I got a bit buried
- On Friday at the gym I was aiming to try for 20kg (45lb) thrusters with the olympic bar. I picked up the bar, did my first thruster and then when I went to return it to my chest... **I hit myself on the head with the bar**. I was frustrated and it hurt, but I was determined to finish. I finished and then upped it to 25kg, which I also completed relatively easily. Feeling awesome for progressing so well, I went to put the bar back on the rack, since it was deracked when I found it. It was then that I realised... it was a women's 15kg bar... **I had been lifting 5kg lighter than I thought**, meaning I hadn't progressed - I had gone backwards! 
- **[I kinda went from deadlift bruises to deadlift sores](http://imgur.com/QN1P95R)**. Ow. Also excuse the leg hair... it's winter here!

**The program itself**

- I still find the horizontal wood chop awkward
- My shoulder has been playing up again but only on days when I'm not lifting. For some reason lifting actually makes it feel better!
- I went back to the wooden bar and perfected my form on the wide-grip deadlift from box. The graphics in the book really helped me work out what I had been doing wrong. Specifically, I'd been trying not to bend my legs too much. I realised I actually needed to almost squat right down to get the bar low enough. 
- After failing to do the right weight, I tried to do some squats at the end of my session, but my body was too exhausted to do more than one ass-to-grass squat at 25kg, so I accepted that the session was over and I'd make up for it next time.
- I'm working out today and thinking that I will add some back squats in after deadlifts just so I can work on progressing at these.
- **That squatting thread the other day really gave me a reality check on my rate of progress.** Specifically, that after 6 months of doing various lifting randomness (admittedly pre-NROLFW I had fuckarounditis) my squat numbers are still stuck at about 25kg/50lbs for 10 reps. I know my thrusters are delayed because of my press weakness, but there's no excuse for back squats being at that level still. I'm thinking that after NROLFW I will be switching to either Stronglifts 5x5 or SS in order to just really work at upping my lift numbers.
- After some reflection I think NROLFW is perfect for beginners and aesthetics, but not *as* great for just working on strength and getting your lift numbers up. Specifically because **after Stage 1 you don't do back squats or standard deadlifts until Stage 7**. 
- For this reason, **I'm thinking of swapping out the deadlift/squat variations in stages 3-6 with simple back squats and deadlifts.**

Then, last week, I went on vacation for about 8 days and basically said ""eff it"" to my diet.

Could this be because I wasn't eating enough and my body was clinging to my fat stores? Or is something else at work?

I recently decided to make some lifestyle changes after a rough year full of personal losses.  I joined a gym that came highly recommended by some friends as being inexpensive but effective.

I'm 23, currently 175 lbs with a goal weight of 140.  My THR is between 137 and 187. BMI is 38% (ouch).  I recently started eating lots more veggies and lean protein -- cut out red meat almost entirely (colon cancer runs in the family).  I'm also trying to cut down on simple carbs/sugars.

I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to fitness/gyms.  When I signed up, I was booked for a ""consult"" with a personal trainer...naively, I thought that I would just get some pointers for getting started.  As it turned out, I went in today to meet with him and was subject to what ended up being an hour-long sales pitch.  

I was embarrassed and discouraged -- he really made it seem like I was not going to be able to work out effectively without the help of a trainer.  I simply cannot afford one.  It wouldn't be a matter of cutting elsewhere -- I am getting by right now, and $200/month for a PT is simply out of the question.  He actually suggested I take out a personal loan to cover it -- what?!

Now I know that it's a sale he's trying to make, but I went to the locker room and just...cried.  It feels so impossible to do without any guidance.

As I said, I am a bit of a novice when it comes to fitness.  Does anyone have any advice to give on how I should be training?  Is cardio enough, or should I incorporate some resistance training into it?  I've begun making much healthier food choices and tracking on MFP, but I need to get myself moving physically.  What kinds of cardio or resistance training do you ladies do?  I had anticipated heading to the gym 4 days a week to begin with.  Too much or too little?  Or just right?

I did use the search function and came up with some results, but not exactly what I was looking for.  Any advice or insight would be *tremendously* appreciated.  Thanks, ladies!

**EDIT:** Thank you SO much to everyone who responded with such kind words!  If anything, reading your ladies' stories makes me now MORE determined to prove that guy wrong.  It wasn't that he was unfriendly -- I just really resent the implication that unless I pay for their services I'm a) of no use as a customer and b) going to be fat forever.

I'll be checking out a bunch of those links you guys listed (since today is my ""off"" day from the gym :) and get started workin' on my fitness :P Thanks so much for the support!

**EDIT 2:**  Wow, the tips and stories just keep coming in!  You girls have MORE than made up for yesterday's setback.  I feel more motivated and encouraged than ever!  I hit up the gym today and did 30 mins of resistance training and 45 mins of cardio...felt amazing afterward!  Endorphins are an amazing thing; I just feel great.

1351700565.0,34,self.xxfitness,12ektc,Are women actually the main Discouraging Factor in Weightlifting for Women?,C-Hulk,43,9,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/12ektc/are_women_actually_the_main_discouraging_factor/,"This is a question that has been nagging at me for awhile. So I thought I’d organize my thoughts and open a discussion on it. See, women who weightlift, myself included, lament that not enough women do. And while I try my best to educate those around me, and offer to teach them if they’re interested, I can’t help but feel like a very, very small minority.

Sure, I have had a few of the male demographic react negatively to the fact that I lift. I’ve heard the “too manly” insult, the “women get bulky” myth, the “why do you want to be strong?” question. I’ve heard the usual “why would you want to look like that?”, “Bodybuilding women are gross”, and “That’s too much muscle”. But lately, I’ve been watching WHERE the majority of those comments are coming from, and too my great disappointment, more frequently than any other demographic, those comments are coming from other women.


When I think of the people who encourage me to lift, its mostly men. My brother showed my why I could lift, my best friend’s boyfriend gave me an orientation to the weight room, and its my guy friends who routinely ask me how my numbers are doing. And its my girl friends who tell me that I’m “too masculine”, and that “I don’t need that strength” and even attack me for having ""high testosterone"". In the same breath, those same girls tell me how they wish my had my body, that I was “lucky” to eat so much and stay “thin”.

Now, obviously this is a forum that is significantly more enlightened than mass culture, and I’m sure that the majority of us are painfully aware of the entire generation of miss-information when it comes to women,diet, and fitness. Lately, I’ve felt like there may be a light at the end of that tunnel, but sadly, for everyone truly enlightened women, two more seem to shut their eyes against it. There is very little we can do for a woman who absolutely refuses to see science and reason. However, I think that we might, inadvertently, be part of the problem.

The other day a girl asked me if I lifted to lose weight. And I nearly laughed like she had told me some joke before I realized that she was actually looking for a reason to get into it. After talking with her I realized, that I’d been doing something wrong. Unintentionally, I’d made myself intimidating. I’d made the people around me feel the same way I felt my first time in the weight room; like I was an ignorant, fat fool.

So I was part of the problem. I was one of the barriers between women and lifting. I was a discouraging factor. And now I see it everywhere. Not just in my actual life, but on the forums. Mistakes made in ignorance are often attacked viciously (less so in xxfitness than others), and I can only imagine the effect that it has on the person’s attitude toward lifting. Since that realization, I took a different approach. When the topic is brought up in anyway now, I focus less on why I like being strong and hate cardio and love having muscles, and more on how it takes care of my body. I speak more on how empowering it feels, and how it relaxes me and affects my moods. I’ll pull up articles and explain why we don’t function like men, and I show them different bodies of people that lift, including my own. Two weeks ago, I saw one of the girls in my classes pick up a 12lb dumbell.

What the hell. 

So on the way out I spoke to the staff at the desk, approached it softly by saying I thought a staff member might have been trying to tell me something when I was in the squat rack but I had my headphones in (true, but they were turned off so I know the guy didn't say anything), so if he was around did he want to discuss my form or something.

I really enjoy weights, and I want to get fit. Well, I've been learning from the internet, because I'm poor-ish and leery of hiring a PT that might turn out to be lousy.

I was at the gym tonight and was doing dumbbell flies (flyes?) when a nice guy comes over and asks to help me with my form. (As a quick aside, he's gorgeous - really, really hot. I was intimidated!) He shows me some tips for getting more out of my workout. Then, I move to my next exercise and the same things happens. He ends up training my whole routine for the night for free, giving me encouragement and being very polite.

He'd sold me by the second exercise (incline bench press - inclined due to a slipped disc I have). I really, really FELT the workout in a way I hadn't before. It proved to me that I can't learn JUST by watching videos online and reading about the routine. By the time I got finished with my night, I was jelly. I'm having a hard time typing this, even!

To give some backstory, I'm 25 and for the past 15 years dealt with ED-NOS in which I'd throw up most of my meals during long stretches of times. No binges, just throwing up. It's over now. 

Anyhow whenever my goals or habits come up with people, they feel the need to give me all of their unwanted opinions. I'm eating too much, not enough, I need to try this, I need to do keto or paleo (no thanks!). And then the big one, that at under 5' my ideal weight is around 100lbs or so, and I need to lose a lot more. That weight would NOT work for me and I know it and they always give me shit and are like ""Well enjoy being overweight forever"" and say things like that. I know my body better than they do and I know what it needs. I would not look good or feel good at 100lbs, I'd be way too thin for my *personal* taste. 

When I reach my goal weight, and all along, I'm doing strength training because being strong is more important to me than being small. That's just for me. Personally. 

 That seems to bother people because it's like it's not fit ENOUGH for *them*. 

I know this just doesn't happen to me, so how would you deal with it? How HAVE you dealt with people who think they know EVERYTHING about fitness and healthy living?

**[Follow me on Fitocracy](http://www.fitocracy.com/profile/Dodge87)**

Firstly allow me to apologise for not posting last week. Long story short, my training had been interrupted by being accepted last-minute into a PT training course that thoroughly ruined my weekend plans but does mean that I will get my first certificate (you need two here to be a PT) this Sunday - my birthday! Yay! That said, I have finished Stage 2 after staying back at the gym after one of the course days (exhausting!) so will update on that below.

**BUT... Given today marks almost 6 months into my quest to get fit and sexy, I figured it was a good chance to show my overall progress for the year.**

[**Behold the glory of lifting combined with 80% paleo diet - sorry for the angle/lighting difference**](http://i.imgur.com/97wBSzI.jpg)

And [here are the standard progress update shots since beginning NROLFW in April](http://i.imgur.com/gM5CDiB.jpg). 

Overall progress stats:

Measurement | Then | Now | 6-month Change
:---|:---|:---|:---
Height| 172cm/5'8""
Age | 25 years
Weight | 69.8kg (154lbs) | 62.5kg (138lbs) | Lost 7.3kg (16lbs)
Waist | 78cm (30.7"") | 69cm (27"") | Lost 9cm (3.7"")
Hip (Butt) | 103cm (40.6"") | 95cm (37.4"") | Lost 8cm (3.2"")

People have definitely noticed the change, as I mentioned [in my Feats of Thorsday comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1hmuum/weekly_thread_feats_of_thorsday_behold_our/caw6c9f).


Also during the PT training we tested our 1RM for bench. I've gone from barely managing the bar at the start of the year, to now being able to bench 35kg (77lbs) as my 1RM - this is *without actually benching even once between then and now*, so **the increase has come from NROLFW's programme improving my chest strength.** 

More exciting than any of the above though, is that **MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS NOW NORMAL** after being diagnosed with hypertension 2 years ago. I cardio'd my ass off trying to bring that blood pressure down, and now that I've switched to predominantly lifting 3x a week combined with the improved diet, it is in the normal range (120/81). 

**So back to NROLFW: My impressions of Stage 2**

- I found the horizontal woodchop awkward, and after finally working out why (form issue) I feel the book could have been clearer in explaining it
- On that topic, some of the names of exercises are quite unique and/or different to convention. I feel like, c'mon, this is the 21st century, why not record some official form vids so people can see exactly what you're trying to get us to do.
- Fitocracy's lack of appropriate exercises to log is frustrating
- I really enjoyed the addition of the HIIT for 15mins at the end of the workout. Although this does lengthen workout time significantly, it feels great! I've been alternating between 2min walk (6kph/3.7mph) and 1min run (10kph/6.2mph) but I'm going to increase this because it hasn't felt too taxing.
- After struggling with the wide-grip deadlift, I ended up really enjoying it. And went from the 15kg women's bar to 35kg total, most of which I think came from an improvement in form.
- As per [my feats of Thorsday comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1hmuum/weekly_thread_feats_of_thorsday_behold_our/caw6c9f) I've added in an accessory/flexibility day since my hamstring tightness has become a serious issue for my squats, and because (woo!) I know how to write up programmes now. Absolutely the toughest for me is 1-legged squats, which are also in Stage 3 of NROLFW, so I'll be adding these into every single workout from hereon in to really work on my left side in particular.
- I enjoyed thrusters a lot, but my inability to progress based on the 'press' section of the lift was disheartening, since I new I could front squat much heavier. 

**Stage 3 ahead**

- I finish up my course this weekend. It involves a lot of lifting/moving throughout the day so I've decided not to begin on Stage 3 until next week, to ensure my body gets the rest it needs.
- Hopefully Monday will be Stage 3, Workout 1, but otherwise it will be as late as Thursday due to a short trip I'm taking Tues + Weds.
- As a result, my update next week will probably be quite short and/or boring!",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,bear-lifting,True,t3_1ho7e9,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1ho7e9/progblog_new_rules_of_lifting_for_women_nrolfw/,

More info on the first page of the survey!

- From feedback, it seems the survey takes about 10 minutes to fill out.

- I'd very much appreciate your input! I've posted this to r/fitness and r/bodybuilding, but those tend to be male-dominant communities and I'd like to get a balanced perspective (at least within these communities).

Yesterday I got a wild hair to break up the walkway outside of my house. I'm tired of the ice buildup in the winter turning it into a slide (it's a sloping walk). So I grabbed a 10lb sledgehammer and went to town. I knocked out 24' of 5"" x 36"" x 40"" concrete slabs.

- What do I do if I eat a LOT on one day/week? Should I eat less the next day/week?

I have struggled with, re-evaluated, nearly given up, and re-started my fitness journey so many times over the years. Sometimes it can feel like such an uphill battle - with misinformation and destructive lifestyle factors (and people) discouraging you and making you question yourself. I have finally started to come to peace with myself and you were the catalyst!

For context, I am now 5’8” and about 150 lbs (depending). About a year ago I completed a very intense 12-week diet and training program. I lost a lot of weight (I got down to about 140 lbs) and thought that I had finally “achieved” something. Over the course of this past year, though, I struggled with bingeing, over-exercising, and generally bad habits and couldn’t get out of the cycle. I had read several comments on xxfitness about “eating enough” and I thought “well, that won’t work for me. I need to eat as little as possible during the week so I can have my cheat weekends!” I would be netting 1000 cal a day during the week (eating 1500 and doing pretty hefty workouts) and then completely going off the rails on the weekends. I would literally spend all day Friday through Sunday stuffing my face with everything I could find. I thought that it was working for me, because my lifts were increasing and my measurements were staying consistent, even though my weight was creeping up. Well, something finally clicked and this is the first week in almost a year that I am making sure to eat at maintenance, and for the first time in almost a year I am not miserable! I didn’t realize how much my unbalanced lifestyle was affecting me.

I also came to the realization that the program that started it all had contributed to me developing a disordered eating pattern because I had essentially starved myself for 12 weeks without realizing it (I thought that my period just went away due to normal hormone fluctuations and that my libido died a natural death). The weight I had lost was as much muscle as fat. The worst part is, I actually recommended this program to others!

Sometimes it is hard to take advice, and even harder to admit I was wrong. Thank you so much, ladies and non-ladies for helping me see the error of my ways and helping me find a more balanced path!

It's normal to be sad, it's normal to mourn awhile, but it's not normal to be thrown back into an untreated anxiety disorder (I hope, for everyone else's sake). 


The first time this kind of anxiety manifested, there was no clear cause. I thought I had Crohns or IBS or a gluten intolerance, and no one could figure out why I was too nauseous to move. Finally I was so sad at being too sick to enjoy college that I started seeing a therapist. That's when I learned that depression and anxiety can have major physical effects and that's what my problem was. I got on an anti-depressant and got back to normal, and stopped meds when I lost insurance. 


Cut to last week: dumped, alone in a giant house we were fixing, no close friends in the city. I can't sleep, more frequent panic attacks, don't have an appetite and can't keep food in me, and the nausea is pretty crippling. I have insurance now and an appointment with a psychiatrist, but...

I've been seeking out thinspo crap and thinking things like, maybe this would be easier if I looked a little better. WTF. 


I KNOW this isn't good. The week before the unpleasantness, I hit every personal record for every lift. I was getting as close to 1g protein/lb of bodyweight as I could (vegetarian). I don't want to give up strength training, but I know if I try on 200cals/day and no sleep I'm just going to hurt myself. Eating makes me feel sick and out of control. 


As I said, I already have an appointment with a professional, I just don't have anyone to talk to about this and wanted to vent to some strong ladies. Any personal advice/experience on how to step back from the ED ledge?

I was just in Whole Foods in the frozen dessert section (....ahem....) and came across this stuff which is basically ice cream made from whey protein concentrate.

How does it taste? Well, it's hard to describe, but it tastes ""fluffier"" than ice cream. The mouthfeel, if you will, is more like other ice cream substitutes than the real thing. I got chocolate peanut butter, though I only see and taste chocolate. I don't see myself wanting to eat the whole pint in one sitting like, say.....haagendaaz pb &amp; chocolate, which might be the best thing ever.

1374802496.0,33,self.xxfitness,1j2hk0,"ProgBlog - No longer NROLFW, now SL5x5 - Week 1 - TAKE NOTE: Progress takes TIME!",DugongOfJustice,34,1,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1j2hk0/progblog_no_longer_nrolfw_now_sl5x5_week_1_take/,"Hi all,

So as you can probably gather from the title (and from my noob question on Tuesday), I've decided to make the switch from NROLFW to SL5x5. As I outlined in [my last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1ils67/progblog_new_rules_of_lifting_for_women_weeks_12/), this is because I was getting frustrated with what I felt was overly complex routines in New Rules. Learning to be a PT, and knowing what I know now about exercise and lifting, I thought to myself ""It doesn't have to be this complex!"" so I went to one of the simplest lifting routines around, StrongLifts 5x5. 

**But before I begin, here's a little PSA: Meaningful progress is SLOW!** I say this because I thought I'd mix up today and put in...

**[A month-by-month look at my progress this year](http://i.imgur.com/bCq2iqF.jpg)**

As you can see, changes came slowly, I paced myself, and I let myself adjust to things before changing. **The biggest lesson I have learnt is that if you are frustrated or upset about your progress, you're best to wait a week before changing your diet or routine**, because it can be an emotional rollercoaster and it's easy to have a bad day and think about throwing it all away. 

Anyway, I loved what I got out of NROLFW, and there's no doubt that I'd continue to recommend it as a terrific starting programme for people unfamiliar with lifts, who like variety, and who need a good read to kick them out of that old-fashioned mindset that eating less is always better.

StrongLifts is a very different program in that it never changes, but I'm already thrilled with the results, which I think are very visible already, despite not having lost a pound. On this, I've come to realise that my TDEE is lower now that I've lost the weight, so I've had to adjust my cut to 1600 calories a day, + 200 on lifting days. I'm only 2kg (about 4.5lbs) away from my goal weight, and I'm very much looking forward to reaching it so I can bring my calories back up and basically swim in bacon.

My starting stats and progress so far for SL5x5:

Lift | Start | Current
--| --| --|
Squat | 29kg / 64lb  | 34.5kg / 76lb
Bench | 22.5kg / 50lb | 24.5 / 54lb
OHP | 20kg / 44lb | NA
Row | 27kg / 60lb | 29.5 / 65lb
Deadlift | 50kg / 110lb | NA

For those not familiar with it, it's just two workouts which you alternate, lifting 3x per week. Workout A is Squat, Bench and Row. Workout B is Squat, OHP and Dead. All are 5x5 except the dead, which is 1x5. 

Some notes about my impressions:

- I can see this being a lot more motivating, mainly because I'll see some steady progress
- I'm looking forward to testing out my strength as time goes on
- I didn't realise I should stay at one weight for each workout, so some I started lighter and ended up at heavier weights by the end. I'm going to stop doing this now and just stick to my working weight instead.
- Next workout I'm going to test out my deadlift 1RM because I'm super curious about whether I can bust past my bodyweight. I'm pretty confident of a yes, but I'd like to know for sure!
- The greatest thing about StrongLifts is that I can do it at my home gym in the garage - I don't need any of the equipment at the gym and as such it's making me consider scrapping my gym memberships and saving some serious cash.
- I've added in a small amount of accessory work, in particular negative chin-ups, since one of my goals for the end of the year is to do a full chin-up. I'm thinking I'll also be adding in push-ups, but we'll see - and I'm working on another goal, which is to do a handstand.
I'm already feeling the chin-ups becoming easier since I started dedicating myself to them a bit more, but my handstand practice has been slacking off a bit. Will have to get back onto this!
- Motivation is high and I'm liking the results, even when just compared to last week! 
- I am, however, feeling the 'commencing lifting bloating' coming back, where you can feel the muscle building underneath the fat. It's in there, and the scale is holding steady despite my cut, so I'm guessing it'll drop in a few weeks and I'll be pretty thrilled to get rid of this gluggy feeling
- My appetite has also increased again and I'm feeling very hungry, very regularly. Today is tough because I have a huge dinner on the cards so I need to go a bit easy on food but my body has different ideas... time for green tea. 
- To answer a question from a previous post: No, I don't do any workouts on rest days. I used to do yoga which was great, but the class timetable doesn't work with my schedule now so on rest days I, umm, rest :p

1374169813.0,36,self.xxfitness,1ikmpa,"I taught my friend how to lift today. Well, mostly.",bekito,43,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1ikmpa/i_taught_my_friend_how_to_lift_today_well_mostly/,"I went with her to her gym on a guest pass. I'm used to my gym, with the metal plates, and the knackered old bars with chalk caked into them with awesomesauce,  and the power cages, and an actual platform for deadlifting, and a lever for unloading/realoading the barbell. 

My friend is used to cardio theater and bodypump classes, and hasn't set foot in the freeweight area of her gym since a trainer (not her trainer, just some guy trying to intimidate her into hiring him I think) told her not to lift because she'll get bulky.

So, after she gave me a short tour of the gym we wandered over to the freeweight area, and occupied a squat rack. She stood there nervously, not paying enough attention to my demonstration of breathing, foot position, bar position and torso angle. She just kept looking around the room. She said she felt like everyone was staring at us, but I didn't see anyone doing that. I know how intimidating it can be to just waltz into a fairly male-dominated area like you belong there, but she was taking the paranoia to the next level. 

When it came time for her to get under the bar and try out a barbell squat, she said ""I can't even lift this! Let's go use the bars in the bodypump room."" Now, I need to preface this with a disclaimer that I've never done bodypump or seen it performed so I had no idea how tiny the bars are for it.  I agreed just because it seemed she was looking for an excuse to go squat somewhere away from the watchful eyes of the guys in the weights area. 

We went upstairs, and I saw the bars and started laughing. I picked one up, and said ""you're not squatting with just this."" For one thing, the bars are not long enough, but also they weigh maybe a 1/2 a lb? For emphasis I tossed it in the air with one hand, caught it and started twirling it like a baton. After the look of horror on her face passed, she agreed to go try squatting the 45lb bar downstairs. 

She's got to work on her squat depth, but otherwise did well on squats. I'll have her do some 3rd world squats at home, and try box squats on her next go so she gains a little confidence in not falling over on her ass. 

Bench was fantastic, and I think she realised as we were doing it that we weren't the center of attention and we had just as much right to be there as anyone else. 

Deadlifts were a little trickier.  No bumper plates meant she had to hold the bar at the start position and lower it back down.  I'm used to being able to lever the bar to unload/load plates so wasn't quite sure how to do it with the bar just lying on the ground, but after some finagling  managed to get some 45's on the ends so I could demo the deadlift at the right start position.  She did well on those too. 

She couldn't lift the bar on its own for OHP, so I had her grab a couple of dumbbells.  She initially reached for the 5lb ones, but I told her ""naw, you can handle the 10's""  and she did, very well.  

:) At the end, she was smiling and more confident, and is excited to go lift more next time.

I'm feeling good about what the test was like, what my results are, and my conversation with the tester!

The test was really quick, and the whole process took less than 30 minutes. I had to fill out some paperwork about my basic medical history before the test, then I got into the pod for 2 one-minute tests. I wore my one-piece swimsuit and they had a little swim cap thing for me to wear over my hair. I just sat in the pod (which looks like [this](http://www.weber.edu/WSUImages/employeewellness/Bod_Pod.JPG) and it measured the air pressure inside.

And then I got a little printout of [my results!](http://imgur.com/a/Q4neZ) 32% is about what I expected for the body fat measurement. The tester said that it can be off by 2% if my skeleton is denser than one of an average girl my age. My weight is exactly what I expected, so it's good to know the scale at my gym is correct!

I was really happy when I saw my TDEE numbers. I was really nervous that it'd be way lower than I expected and I'd have to work really hard to cut down my calorie intake. I described my exercise regimen to her, and the tester said right now I'd be in the ""Active"" category, so if I was looking to lose fat, I should eat at the ""Low Active"" number. About 2000 calories?! I think I can do that!

The girl that tested me looked like an athlete. She had broad shoulders, and even though she wasn't wearing tight clothes, I could tell she was in shape. She looked a lot like a runner to me, tall/thin/lean, so I assumed she ran a lot. When I asked her what kind of exercise she does, she said, ""Mostly lifting."" I tried to hide my excitement as I asked if she lifted heavy or light weights, and to my everlasting glee she said, ""Oh, definitely heavy."" 

!!!!!!

I asked her PRs on squats and dead lift, and she gave out some numbers that were really impressive to me. She said that whenever she goes away from lifting consistently at least twice a week, she starts to feel injuries and pulled muscles starting to happen. She said she thinks it's really important to lift and keep your muscles strong. And I tried not to hug her and dance around the room when she said that.  :P

So, overall, really great experience. It affirmed everything I've learned about the right way to get the body I want. And now I know definite numbers about myself! I will definitely be going again in 6 months or something to see if I've made any progress.

I have ALWAYS struggled with weight. I've been fat since third grade. I was always the ""fat friend."" I always got teased behind my back and never asked out. I know what it's like to totally want to disappear and hide behind whatever you can. Towards the end of high school I got my act together and started losing weight, but when I saw the scale moving back up after I got a desk job it was like I was about to be reliving a nightmare, but after some flailing around I found an AMAZING gym/fitness program and I found you guys! I have muscle in places I never dreamed of, and have run a mile faster than I ever thought I could. For the first time in a very long time I feel like this is within my control. My health is in my hands, and I'm making it happen. 

So, Thank you!! I can always find the help and motivation I need here when I hit a rough patch. This community is so positive, it really helped me get some of the tools I needed to start getting successful on my journey to health! Not to mention I LOVE how candid we can be on here... it's great. I have very few fitness oriented peers in life so it's been great finding some of that here.

This comes after the pretty successful [Top 10 Beginners Tips for Making Healthier Eating Choices](http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/1gype9/conversation_my_top_10_beginners_tips_for_making/). Many of those tips can translate to either cutting or bulking, but I know that a lot of us (particularly those of us who started out on the notoriously shitty MyFitnessPal recommendations) struggle to get to even 1800 or 2000 calories sometimes, let along 2500 or more.

Things I assume you know:

- To gain weight/bulk you need to eat your TDEE + 10-20%
- You should focus on getting enough protein as your #1 macro to concern yourself with
- Lifting heavy is the best exercise to do when bulking if you're trying to gain muscle instead of fat
- **/r/xxgainit and /r/gainit exist and are awesome - visiting and subbing to those communities is one of my unlisted tips! You can also go there to find loads of info about GOMAD, which is one of the more extreme ways to increase your calories.**

##Any attempts to increase calories will be hard when you've adapted to a lower amount, even if it's still under your TDEE. Remember that if you're trying to increase your calories, then you NEED to get your body used to eating this larger amount so that you can achieve your goals. Don't be surprised if it takes 3-4 weeks to adapt. 

**My Top 10 Tips for Eating More:**

^(Note that I may edit these based on feedback/suggestions and since it will be linked in the sidebar)

- **1. Add natural oils and sugars into your cooking:** Fats and sugars both concentrate a large number of calories into a relatively small amount of food, so adding honey, olive oil, coconut oil, butter, etc. into your meals is an easy way to add some extra calories. 1 tablespoon of honey is 50 calories, 1 tablespoon of olive oil is 100-120 calories, and 1 tablespoon of butter is also 100-120 calories. Some folks will even go as far as to carry a little bottle of oil around with them to add to all their salads and any meals they eat while out and about.
- **2. Snack on nuts and nut butters:** Despite their small appearance, nuts are full of great fats and also calories. 30 almonds (a bit more than a handful) is 210 calories. Nut butters are similarly chock full of calories but super tasty and easy to eat as a 'dessert' after any meal, with a tablespoon of peanut butter clocking in at around 100 calories. 
- **3. Drink your calories with great shakes and juices:** This is the enemy of weight loss, but can really help for those who struggle to fit enough calories into their day. When I switched from cutting (1600) to maintaining (2050) this was what made me able to do it in the early stages. I would make a protein shake (170 calories), add a banana (100 calories) and about a half-cup of frozen mixed berries (50 calories) before also adding a tablespoon of honey (another 50 calories), to result in a 370 calorie drink. I used water but if you used something like milk/almond milk/similar then you would get even more calories in. I used to drink this in between meals or even following a full breakfast - it honestly doesn't feel like very much!
- **4. Eat bacon and other fatty meats:** As with the first tip, naturally-occurring fats are a great way to bulk up your calories. Bacon is absolutely brimming with fat and also happens to be exceptionally tasty. It has been a staple of my diet, both when cutting and maintaining - but the difference is in portion size. 100g of raw bacon (for the brand I use that's about 2.5 middle rashers) is 280-300 calories. Cook this up with eggs (and even some extra oil!) and you're easily looking at 400-500 calories for breakfast alone. Follow it up the above shake and you've got 800 calories in you before the day even begins!
- **5. Use bigger plates:** Nope not barbell plates - though they will help give you the muscle you're after! Use larger plates and bowls when serving yourself a meal and you'll naturally eat more. Increasing plate size is a quick way to get more food inside you while still (psychologically) feeling like you're eating the same amount. 
- **6. Be a dugong and graze:** My favourite animal is a dugong (surprise!): the ones held in captivity eat 50kg (110lbs) of cos lettuce a day, which they are fed constantly. If they can maintain their large weight by grazing, then you can up your calorie intake using the same method. Prepare snacks, no matter how lightweight and small, that you can 'graze' on all day - for example popcorn. It may not be chock-a-block with calories, but it does get you used to just automatically dipping the hand and munching the contents. You can also do this with nuts, squares of dark chocolate, carrot sticks, celery sticks, etc. 
- **7. Don't wait until you're hungry:** When losing weight, not eating until you're hungry can be a good philosophy. However, when we're trying to gain weight, it's important to do the opposite: plan your meals and stick to them! If you're taking the advice above, it may be that you feel more satisfied throughout the day, and therefore aren't feeling hungry when large mealtimes roll around. *Do not let that stop you*. If you're serious about this, you have to get your body adjusted to eating when your brain tells it to, rather than just when it's craving it. Because you're eating more energy than you need as part of your plan, your body may not like it or want to cooperate. Eat something anyway!
- **8. Protein bars, protein shakes, protein powders, protein... umm.. anything:** There are approximately 1 gazillion blog posts online with protein-based recipes for delicious cupcakes, pancaked, muffins, home-made bars, shakes, cakes, brownies, cookies etc. If you want something sweet to supplement your diet, these are great things to add in because you'll enjoy eating them SO. FREAKING. MUCH. and you can also share them around so as to keep your eating sociable.
- **9. Eat fruit:** OK so this one you can take or leave depending on your opinion on naturally-occurring sugars and the whole sugar = toxin thing that many people believe. Personally, I have zero problems with fruit. It's easy, snackable, and can easily be blended into shakes or juices. For me, 1-2 bananas a day helped a LOT when just trying to get some extra calories in. Find a fruit of your choice that you find easy to eat on a whim and go for it!
- **10. Sweet potato is your friend:** I'm a total sucker for sweet potato (also known as kumera). Do you remember how you transitioned away from eating french fries or rice or pasta or bread with every meal when you were cutting? Well, now's the time to add sweet potato back into your steak-n-salad dinner! You can either buy the potato itself to just peel, cut and roast; or you can buy pre-packaged sweet potato fries to keep in the freezer. Either way, these are a good way to add 200-300 calories to your proteiny dinners!

The first month the trainer took measurements in the beginning and at the end and I supposedly lost 2% body fat and 2.5 inches off my waist (belly button area) and 1 inch off my natural waist.  But I was still fixated on the scale (which hadn't budged) and when I looked into the mirror, I didn't really see a change.  Plus my pants were still tight around the waist even though it was looser around the thigh area.

So I started getting discouraged.  I was lifting more, but I didn't *feel* healthier or sexier.  Well I just got my cholesterol checked.  Before lifting I was in the 230-250 range where my doctor was considering putting me on meds but preferred not to because of my age (mid 20s).  Now after a month and a half, my non fasting cholesterol clocked in at 159.  I've never been this low for as long as I've been getting tested (younger than 10).  I've never even broken 200.  So to top off this very long winded post, sometimes the benefits of working out are EXTREME even though you may not be able to see it.  Even if I don't technically *feel* healthier, I'm probably healthier than I've ever been in my entire life, which includes all those years I played sports.

So a few of you have been posting ideas for weekly posts, which is AWESOME! So let's try to get it all set up and then we as mods can make sure it all gets linked to in the sidebar so that everyone can find them, and as mods we can post them up and highlight them (like I've done with this post).

As an aside, if you have your heart set on posting any of these in particular and would be interested in modding, just send a message to the mods or myself and outline why you're keen and why you think you'd do a good job. We're pretty cruisy so just an overview is fine!

So, ideas thus far:

- Munchie Mondays: A thread each week focussing on a different topic, for example a macro (e.g. protein, carbs), a particular eating/diet plan (e.g. paleo, keto, show diets), technologies (e.g. HR monitors, calorie counters), and so forth.
- Newbie Tuesday: Perhaps just a simple weekly thread that gives people a chance to ask any of the more basic questions they have, or to point out something new they discovered this week, that they may normally not post about. Alternatively, we could make it topic-based. What do you think?
- Feats of Thorsday: This has been running really well I think - it always annoys me that I miss the rush because of timezones, but the threads seem to be appreciated by all.

This was after hitting a new squat PR of 230lbs; my accessory work includes squat lockout/pins (otherwise known as partial squats).  My trainer is trying to drive it through my head that I am stronger than I give myself credit.  So, I started pins at:

* 260 lb x 3

* 280 lb x 3

* 305 lb x 3

* 330 lb x 3

* 350 lb x 3

Again, these are NOT full ROM squats, so they don't really count.  The victory here is that I was able to get under the weight and legitimately walk it out from the rack, do the work, and walk it back.  I have a lot of work to do on my squat; my form is pretty awful, I struggle to break parallel, and I have a terrible habit of leaning forward when my hip flexors and adductors start to hurt.  On the other hand, I have to be able to see that my efforts are paying off.

Goal weight is b/w 150-155

I started cutting in August to get rid of some of the weight I had put on during college. And I was GOLDEN. I started with a 500 kcal a day deficit and dropped about 20lbs with ease. I love to cooking, so coming up with interesting recipes was no challenge. I was also able to enjoy a few treats with my deficit when I planned carefully - a glass of wine with dinner OR dessert afterwards, butter on my toast, a bit of cream and sugar in my coffee. I am a big proponent of overall lifestyle changes rather than drastic cuts in the things I enjoy and I was able to maintain this while losing weight. I began going to the gym and loved it

I haven't lost a single lb since Feb 1 since my calories dipped below 1450 a day and I am just burned out with cutting. I haven't lost any inches either. Part of my exhaustion with cutting is coming from having to cut out the small treats. Another part is feeling like I can only eat chicken breast and tilapia to hit my protein goals.

I've tried resetting mechanisms that worked in the past few months - take a break to reset hormone levels/production, switch foods to make it mentally less exhausting (different meats! different veggies!), even dropping cardio and just lifting 3x a week (started SL 5x5 a few weeks ago) to help with the transition and nothing is working. 

I am at my wit's end with this - I am cranky and feeling like I am always recovering from DOMS at some point or another. Around my period, my PMS is worse than normal and my cramps end up being more of a bitch to deal with. I am having problems focusing in grad school that didn't happen the week I wasn't tracking calories. I have a sleeping disorder (idiopathic hypersomnia) and cutting now just makes me even more tired than I normally am. And being hungry is really wearing down my resolve to keep cutting.

I *mentally* know the solution is to just bite the bullet and start eating more, but I am having conflicting emotions about eating more when I know I still have weight to lose. All I can think is ""eat less kcals and you'll lose weight!"" when I know that's not the case. I keep thinking if I bump my calories up, I'll stop losing weight and never hit my goal.My goal was to hit my goal weight by the end of May near my 23rd birthday, but it's just feeling so far away right now. 

Basically, I have two areas of questions for you guys. How much should I up my kcal by to get these last 5-10lbs off? Should I toss in more cardio with the higher kcal to help create a deficit or just lift? Why does this technique work?

Second question: mind over emotions. how the hell do you guys *mentally* deal with cutting for long stretches? What keeps you motivated?

It has been seven years of little workout and lots of eating and I am now 251lbs as of this morning. I can no longer participate in activities that I love as easily as I could before. I can't go for a run without my knees hating me, I can't go rock climbing, I can't even take a swim without feeling like I'm going to drown, and I'm a strong swimmer. I went backpacking over the weekend, an activity that I love. I've poured so much money into gear and stuff for it because I love it. Then I realized half of my clothes no longer fit, and I hated being the one lagging behind the group because I physically couldn't keep up. I miss being the happy-go-lucky leader of the trail. The realization that my weight is now keeping me from things that make me happy is, I think, a big wakeup call. 

On top of all of that, my boyfriend and I are planning on getting married. You know I want to look amazing in my dress. My sister and boyfriend both graduated from college two weeks ago, and in all the pictures I hated how I looked. Those big flabby arms, belly that makes me look pregnant, hips a mile wide, butt that you could land a [C-5 Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_C-5_Galaxy) on...

I also know I need to lose weight to be healthy. My family has a history of heart conditions, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Already I have that working against me, so I need to start a more healthy lifestyle. Of all my reasons to lose weight, this is the most important one, without a doubt. 

Sorry this is dragging on, but I'm almost finished.

All in all, ladies, I am here and now declaring the beginning of my journey into fitness! Exercise and healthy food be my vehicle, and the support of fellow travelers be my guide!

brief background about myself- 5'4"", 174lbs, age 25. Lost 25lbs through diet, also run now, training for 10K, so pretty intense workouts a 3-4 times a week. Starting strength training (New Rules of Lifting)

So my question: I've seen many posts here about upping daily calories while strength training to build muscle, with great results- losing fat, gaining muscle. NRL talks about this too and I'm using the ""fat loss"" workout plan.

But I still have significant fat to lose (probably around 50lbs) and I need to keep eating at a deficit.  The examples of women I've seen here are not nearly as overweight as I am. NRL also did not specify if the ""fat loss"" workout is for major or minor fat loss.

My main goal is just to maintain the muscle I have now through training and upping my protein, especially after workouts. Is this a effective plan? Is there any information I'm lacking, or anything I've overlooked? 

Again, sorry if this is a common question, but I've had trouble finding answers on Reddit and elsewhere on the web for my specific situation.

**TL;DR: want to build/maintain muscle but need to lose *significant* fat, what should I do?**

I currently have a pair of 5-lb dumbbells and I can't afford a gym membership, so I'm hoping to work with what I have. Is it possible to start a strength program with only these weights? If so, what would you recommend for exercises? I'm looking to increase arm and core strength mostly. I've seen negative criticisms towards the 200 situp and 100 pushup programs on /r/fitness that have made me reconsider doing them (e.g., apparently situps/crunches aren't what you should be doing for core exercises, the pushup program is inherently flawed because you're limited by your own body weight, both only focus on one group of muscles, etc.).

Background info: I've never done weight training before and I'm pretty wimpy. I do have a somewhat physical job that involves some arm strength (manually pumping groundwater with a foot valve) and I curl once a week. I also run 3 times a week (around 8-10 miles a week, hoping to increase that when it stops being so cold).",,False,,t5_2ryzy,False,,,True,t3_17vf3b,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/17vf3b/is_it_possible_to_start_strength_training_with/,

He needs to lose some weight, and although the ultimate solution for him will be changing his diet, I think getting to the gym more often is a great start.

He went with me for the first time last week, and I walked him through Starting Strength (the program I started on).  He seemed uncomfortable, and he later admitted that he felt awkward about having his much-smaller wife show him how to lift weights (and lifting more than him in some cases).  I recommended that next time, we go at a slow time when the ""bros"" are less likely to be around.  I understand his feelings, but it's too bad that men should feel ashamed about getting tips from a woman.

The best part of the experience was that when I showed him how to squat, he asked if his legs should ""hourglass inwards slightly"" like mine do.  I said absolutely not!  I hadn't noticed that my legs were doing that, and now I'm working on correcting it.  Workout buddies can be very valuable.
