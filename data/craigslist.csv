Ok. Let's be honest. I came into the restroom, you were already midstream, and it sounded like a fucking firehouse was being deployed into the porcelain receptacle. This greatly enhanced my perception of your manhood. Your urethra is wide like the Mississippi, and could probably accommodate Huckleberry Finn, Jim, and several steamboats. I get it. Congratulations.

I entered the restroom, unzipped, and began the evacuation of a meager portion of urine. It trickled, nay, dripped, into the urinal. You know it. I know it. I was finished long before your manly stream was done, and you cast a sympathetic look my way. Possibly, you were worried that my prostate was enlarged by cancer or some other disease, and that it couldn't adequately squeeze my bladder. You probably pictured my dong as being a feeble man-gina, that dribbled urine the way a new mother's over-engorged breast dribbles milk. A dipple.

Well listen to me you self-satisfied prick. I can piss with the best of them. I can let loose a flood of a magnitude that might require God to come down from on high and warn some motherfucker to build a boat and grab some fucking animals. Forty days, forty nights. What happened is, I had a meeting. I was going to be leading a call with something like 30 clients on the line. I would have no chance to get off the line. So I just did a little top off. Just emptied the tank, even though I didn't REALLY need to go. I didn't count on Mr. Firehose Dong being right next to me. I didn't expect that someone with a urethra the size of my thumb would be punishing the porcelain one urinal over. So don't feel like you're superior to me, man. In fact, count this as an invitation. Meet me in the restroom on the west side of the building At 1:30 pm on Monday and I will UNLEASH HELL on the urinal. I will expel a stream of urine that will cause barn animals in the next county to flip out. Bring me a terrorist and I will water board that motherfucker with my pee. You will see rainbows in the geyser that flows from my pee hole. Let's do this.

It's a Friday, and you are loading up Reddit in the middle of your highly productive workday, and you see a link to a particularly funny post on the popular classifieds-esque website, *Craigslist*. Now, you just can't wait to be able to share a genuine LOL with the Reddit community, so you, in the midst of soaring workplace productivity, click the link.

Then it happens. You see the following text on your screen:

**This post has been flagged for removal.**

You panic. You click on over to the comment list and are bombarded with the perfect, 6000+ upmodded, 80-comment pun thread, and you have to read through three pages of fraternal wordplay until you finally figure out the gist of the original, but no longer humorous post.

Your head falls to your cluttered desk, and you let out a silent scream of frustration.

This, my fellow Redditians, is inefficient.

I propose that we as a collective hereby take screenshots of any Craigslist pages, and submit them in lieu of the possibility of post deletion.

&gt;CAUTION: When posting in this subreddit, **either copy/paste the contents of the post into a comment on your thread or use an imgur link**. It's bad for everyone when craigslist ads disappear, taking their content with them.

From now on though, we're going to start removing threads where the OP doesn't follow this rule. It's pretty much just being lazy at this point, especially when sites like http://snag.gy/ exist (print screen, crop, ctrl + v into their website, then use an app like [this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/naicjelodgogagjjkgepdkjecopegkag) to automatically host it on imgur.)

It takes about 30 seconds or so, everyone knows reddit post with imgur links get more updates anyways, and you're following this community's rules.

**Mystery Box - $40**

Alright jerks, listen up. I'm selling a mystery box of items. That's right, a goddamn mystery box. There could be anything inside there. An original manuscript from a self-published mystery novel and a few hundred rubber bands? Sure. A tropical-themed diorama made entirely of Pogs and broken cutlery? Maybe. A few books, a model kit, some CDs, movies and computer games, some other stuff? That sounds like a reasonable guess. Little shredded up bits of paper supporting an assortment of tin cans missing their labels? YOU DON'T KNOW, STOP GUESSING. WHY WOULD I CALL IT A ""MYSTERY BOX"" IF I TOLD YOU WHAT'S INSIDE, IDIOT?

That said, there's two things I will tell you about this box. First, there's nothing nasty or illegal in there. So all you stoners better pack up your paraphernalia and all you perverts better shove your c*ck back in your pants, because there's NOTHING to see here. Let your disgusting imaginations and filthy money run wild somewhere else on this god-forsaken website. Next, I'm sure most of you are saying ""why is this gai askin for 40 bux for a box of stuff??? is this guy retarded?? lol"" I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL YOU WHY IT'S FORTY DOLLARS, RETARD. For one, you're not just getting a pile of crap in a green Loblaws bag. You're getting ALL of the following:

- Over $100 worth of things that I'M STILL NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT
- An authentic corrugated cardboard box, carefully packed and sealed to ensure the safety of the items and ease of transport. It's also recycled, for all you tree-hugging hippies out there.
- One poem about a topic of the buyer's choice. It will be written in doggerel verse or iambic pentameter, depending on the subject. Hand-written on supple xerography paper and placed in the box before delivery. Guaranteed to move you to tears, melt your ice-encrusted heart and/or turn a asscrack day into a red-letter one.
- Decorations on the box made to your specifications, as long as I can do it with markers, glue and sparkles
- A list of the best restaurants in downtown Toronto. Only applies to people who don't have a palate that's crap
- Similar fun as that one website, except the box is delivered in less than two months and I won't make you my b*tch by mailing you a goddamn necktie. (The box may still contain a necktie, however)
- If you hate everything in the box, you can donate it all to charity, giving you the gift of smug self-satisfaction
- The breathtaking rush of a risky investment
- An epic tale of a wonderful box to tell your grandchildren about

Better send me an email fast about your interest in this amazing offer, because the thorazine is going to kick in sooner or later and then I'm gonna realize that I'm giving a box of primo stuff away for goddamn pennies. If you're STILL griping about the money, feel free to give me an offer, but consider this: has your life gotten so grim that you want to negotiate with a heavily-medicated lunatic about a box that might contain 5000 origami cranes made out of old Polish newspapers? That's what I thought.

For all of you intelligent enough to see a once-in-a-lifetime offer such as this, I can meet you anywhere near the subway, and will hand deliver your box to you at a mutually beneficial time. If you can't meet me on the subway line or a short bus route, then weep bitter tears of disappointment because you will never be the proud owner of this box. If you're afraid that you'll have to interact with a man whom aliens instructed to sell his most valuable possessions to keep the spiders from overrunning the earth; I promise that I will be mostly clothed and won't discreetly spit out the olanzapine when the orderly isn't looking on the day I meet you. I mean, I'll try not to spit it out, but I'm only human.

Hope to hear from you soon! :)

Flagged no matter what I try. $10 bucks PayPal if this is solved no joke.,wdarea51,19,6,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/craigslist/comments/ff0uq/please_help_i_am_at_wits_end_flagged_no_matter/,"Ok here is the deal.  I am beside myself because I have tried everything possible to not have my post flagged on craigslist and nothing works.  This is my main source of income so I would be eternally grateful if someone could shed some light on what is going on.  Also please save the ""you are the one using craigslist, its free, nothing you can do"" posts, I already know that.

I run a DJ company in Harrisburg, PA.  I have been putting ads on craigslist for about a year and a half.  I had ""different"" ads in six different cities with two different accounts and none EVER got flagged.  The ads were different and craigslist did not see them as the same so it was ok.

Fast forward to December 2010, ads keep getting taken down.  So i only post one ad on each account to see if its an over posting problem.  Still flagged.  So i left this go for about a month and today i tried to repost the ads and they got taken down within three hours no joke.  So here is what i have tried to remedy the situation.

1. Tried posting Text only ads with no graphics, same account as before.  Flagged
2. Created new account with new email, new phone verified number, same IP though. Flagged
3. Posting at a different IP with same account (diff. location). Flagged

4. The ultimate attempt to get past this... (actually did this twice) NEW account, NEW phone number, NEW IP address.  Completely different person (according to the system).  Also completely different AD, text and graphics, different image hosts and everything.  This attempt would have made me look like a completely different person to the system and they STILL GOT FLAGGED.  With different everything, including ad and title.

At this point I have no idea what to do.  If the ad still gets taken down when im a complete different person to the system and the ad is completely different with different wording and everything i have no idea what to do.  If anyone could shed some light on this that would be great, Its my main source of income and im out of options.  The text of the ad ranged from the complex to very basic with no phone numbers or email to link the ads or accounts to each other.  

Ive used my girlfriends phone number, my phone, moms phone, dads phone, brothers phone, friends phone, and grandmas phone.  So any foolproof thing would be great im running out of phones haha.

edit: this is being posted in harrisburg, PA services section.
Also my ads are being removed from different areas other than harrisburg, including baltimore, philly, state college, york, and lancaster.  I am currently testing an ad in Iowa for shits to see if that gets removed also. Trying to narrow down what could be causing it.  The Iowa ad is very basic text only from the account that is completely fresh in every way.

This person (Dave for explaination's sake) said he will send me a money order in the mail, and upon recieving the money order the shipping company would come pick up the bed. This morning, I recieved an email from Dave saying that his assistant accidentally sent my money order to somebody else, and sent somebody else's money order to me; and that upon recieving the larger money order, I should cash it in the bank and then use western union to wire the remaining balance to the manager of the shipping company. Is this a legit practice or am I getting duped. As time goes on, the situation seems more and more fishy, so I turn to you all for advice.

::Edit:: Thank you. I'm not sure why I even let the idea of this being legitimate enter my brain, but you guys are there to slap me back to reality! Thank you!

Update: Even after I changed the ads yesterday to say 'local only, cash only' I have recieved 3 emails that claim that cash won't work, but they'll gladly send money orders.

Moving on, I recently bought a game off craigslist: Heavy Rain for PS3. Or so I thought. The post of course is already deleted. Supposedly $25 for a sealed new black label copy. Great, right? I admit, I was stupid to not check on the spot and open it there at the meet. I go home and open it, surprise! Killzone 2 disc inside. The box was shrink wrapped (not hard to imagine he had access to a shrink wrap machine at work or something), and the cover and even the manual was Heavy Rain. Only the disc was Killzone 2. I've texted back to the guy but no reply (didn't hurt to try). I want to believe this was an honest mistake. I can only see two circumstances for this case: he either accidentally put the wrong disc in before he wrapped it or someone else did and he got it from them. Either way, he lied about it being new. Upon closer inspection, the disc is in fine condition but the box does have very small dents in a couple places. My best bet now is to just sell it (I see other posts for about $10-15).

Is this an apartment scam?,teeheehehe,10,1,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/craigslist/comments/1j6jht/please_humor_me_is_this_an_apartment_scam/,"I know. If it's seems like a scam, then yes it's scam. Please just humor me because I need peace of mind.

I am looking for a room in an apartment. I thought I found a nice place. I met the ""landlord"" who lives in house. His CL ad was detailed, written well, had photos etc. He gave me a tour of the house. I'm quite certain he used his real name and email address when contacting me since he's on LinkedIn, Facebook, etc. Seems legit.

A few days later, I emailed him to say that I was serious about renting.

**Red flag #1** He says ""Please submit a check for $1000 security deposit tomorrow morning."" 

Umm, what? We haven't even discussed a contract. Why does he want me to send money immediately? I responded that I'd like to see a contract first.

I googled some more about Craigslist scams. Seems like a popular one is for scammers to ""lease"" an apartment that doesn't belong to them and one in which someone else occupies. Advice: ask to see the deed to the property and also look up records to see who's paying taxes on the property. Unfortunately, I couldn't find the tax information through googling the address.

**Red flag #2** He responds ""Please come over tomorrow morning to read and sign the contract and to submit your check.""

I understand it's the weekend and he should have the right to show other prospective renters the place. But he's still trying to take my money immediately...

**Red flag #3** I called him back, reiterating that I was serious about the apartment. I asked to see the deed, again because I wised up on those common Craigslist scams. He became flustered, said that *I* raised red flags for *him*, and said that it was completely unheard of to ask property owners for their deeds. He hung up.

Is this a scam?

Damn, I want to believe so badly that this guy isn't a scheming asshole.


edit
I conclude that this guy is indeed a scheming asshole.

**Red flag #4** The apartment isn't even available until September. There's no reason why today (and no other day) is critical for him to have my commitment to the apartment...... so fuck that guy.",,False,,t5_2qh5k,1374965673.0,,,True,t3_1j6jht,http://www.reddit.com/r/craigslist/comments/1j6jht/please_humor_me_is_this_an_apartment_scam/,

I am seeking a new love.

It's spring, lets bloom together and have the power of our passion force out the lukewarm weather we have been having.

Once the thrill of falling in love hits your system look out! You're alive again. I want my soul to be infused with the bounces and bubbles that effervesce from the thrusting, throbbing waves of emotion that suddenly spurt from making the choice to free fall into love.

I want a man who wants to get lost in the passionate chasm of love. A man who enjoys the slow, gentle, soothing friction of two personalities gently becoming one. The assuaging, velvet grip of romantic obsession that makes you refuse to ever pull out of the embrace of new emotion.

A nice young man between 26 and 29. (I like em a little older;-). Please be sweet and lovable and smell awesome!
Race and height don't matter.

I am a woman ready for something new!
And let me tell you, I need it. My luck has been terrible lately.

I am over $24,000 in debt from throwin dice in Atlantic City and close to $4,000 in debt from dukin it out with the one armed bandits at the Sugarland in Philly
.
I am disease and drug free. (Did have gonorrhea 3x but it is fully treatable and is ancient history) I have not touched Oxycotin in over 17 weeks and am glad that whole six year ordeal is over. I have sworn off of the meth and my word counts, my teeth can't take anymore.

Anorexia and bulimia have been on again, off again problems for me. The last of my 3 stays at Philadelphia's Belmont mental hospital resolved that though. I still struggle to accept food won't make me fat and ugly.

I have 4 children. Each is a beautiful treasure individual to his and herself. All of them have ADD, and obsessive compulsive disorder. One has severe tourettes syndrome and my youngest daughter seems to have permanent diarrhea. Both boys are chronic bed wetters. Both fathers are out of the picture, one incarcerated the other deceased via the North Philly business venture gone sour.

I love my six dogs and 3 cats, 1 parakeet, 1 parrot, 2 canaries, 3 ferrets, 3 hamsters and 11 guinea pigs. Animals make life so much more full. But they got me evicted from my last apartment and newspaper training them is so much work. We are now living with a man named Mel who is challenged with mild Down's syndrome and H.I.V.

I have been unemployed for a few years now. Welfare only goes so far so money is tight. It is hard for me to find work because I threw out my back 2 years ago and have trouble with the physical constraints of working. I have been working towards my GED for a few years now and hope to have it by 2014. I was at a job in a warehouse for a toilet manufacturer when I slipped while carrying a returned urinal.

How are you doing today? Great I hope. I got the information and I am pleased to inform you that  it has been forwarded to my Associate to issue out payment to you immediately. You will be having an excess Check which will include the cost of the apartment for the First and Last month and my daughter's travel expenses ( Tickets and Bookings ) as well as other arrangements. As to make things easier for her in order to prevent further delay. Once you have the check you are expected to deposit it for clearance and it won't take more than 1-3 days I suppose before it clears into your account.Once it clears, deduct the cost of the room for the first and last month, the security deposit and other utility bills and send the balance through Western Union Money Transfer to my travel Agent so they can prepare my daughter's traveling documents and flight tickets. She will be heading to united state the moment everything is in place.

Having a check issued out to you and another to my Travel Agent will demand two clarification from me by your Bank and the Bank of my Travel Agent and considering the fact that am being time conscious as my doughter have to be in the united state the soonest possible, there may not be enough time for other arrangements which was why I suggested that I address a check with all expenses to you. Please accept my apology for any inconvenience this might cause. I will forward you my Travel Agent's information you need to wire the difference to them, Okay.

This was probably foolish, but I decided I'd up the price and just say I'd take the best offer I received after two weekends. I get an angry email (it's actually pretty - um, interesting?

So, I adopted this cat from a cat shelter in Seattle. I won't say which one. When I adopted him, he had just been given a series of vaccines, so he was lethargic. I liked the idea of a lethargic cat. (He's the gray and white one in the photo)

Once we got him home and the vaccines wore off, it became clear that this cat is NOT lethargic. No, in fact, he is the exact opposite. He is full of energy. OMFG, so much energy. And he is dumb. My god, this is the dumbest cat I have ever dealt with.

He's sweet - oh, he is very sweet. He loves other cats, he likes dogs, he likes people - all kinds of people. He likes food. He likes playing. He loves paper bags, plastic bags, window sills, watching birds, sleeping in sinks, and generally annoying the living daylights out of everyone around him. Oh, did you leave your medication on the kitchen counter? Well, it's his now. Did you take more than 2 seconds to open a can of cat food? Well, he's going to have to jump and and take the bowl right out of your hands. He likes jumping.

The only thing he DOESN'T like is the vacuum cleaner, which causes him to dry heave and then hide in his litter box for 36 hours or so.

He doesn't smell great. Sometimes he gets really excited and creates a smell that's a little like tuna fish. It's not pleasant.

What a catch, amiright? I'm sure you're clamoring to get your hands on this beast. Well, if you are, feel free to contact me. He comes with a litter box, a month's worth of wet food (you can try to feed him dry food, but you will regret it), a carrier, and grooming tools. He's housebroken and everything, but my god, the smell. THE SMELL. Keep the litterbox in your garage or you will live to regret it.

I feel terrible that we are unable to keep him, but I'm at my wit's end. My husband refuses to let him outside (""The shelter said that we're not supposed to!""), and this cat NEEDS TO BE OUTSIDE OCCASIONALLY. He is neutered (the cat, not my husband), and up-to-date on all of his shots. ",,False,,t5_2qh5k,False,,,True,t3_1820c1,http://www.reddit.com/r/craigslist/comments/1820c1/special_kitty/,

I assembled what appears to be the decent offerings on craigslist for beginner bikes as of this moment in time. I'm hoping to find a riding buddy.

Anywho, here's the list, everything under a grand, that's titled, that I thought was a ""good deal"" for a beginner, leaving out immaculate but somewhat pricey ones, bikes that will tempt you to be stupid (which you won't survive if you're new on a bike, don't kid yourself) or bikes that are going to hit someone in the wallet hard if they drop it and have to sell it:

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2686915149.html

This isn't very old, is reliable, and practical. The handling is probably great, as I learned on a very similar model, and if you're looking for a way to break into motorcycling, I recommend starting with a scooter like this one, so you learn to keep your eyes front, how to steer and turn with power, etc. I also have a tiny 50cc 2-stroke bike, so we could still go for rides. This one is fully automatic, and can be modified to do some fairly ridiculous things. Check youtube. I've seen these go 65+ mph. It's nuts. That's my top pick.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2708815412.html

CM400t's are entirely bulletproof, from what I've heard, and are very easy to learn on as they're semi-automatic. Despite the larger engine size, it's pretty low on power, and has been described by a lot of people I know as a great starter bike. This is my second pick.

http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/mcy/2709296158.html
This is another good priced, Honda, same size, same power (ish), and has a lot going for it. It's a reasonable bargain.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2724789720.html

This is the kind of bike I ride (but not mine. Mine's red). It's a bit too powerful for a ""beginner,"" in my tastes, but it's still a good bike.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2722784266.html

Yes, it's over $1,000, but it's about the only reputable sport bike on there for any price approaching $1,500 that I can find. It has been dropped, so be careful, check the turn signals/mirrors, make sure they match. If they do, it probably wasn't that bad.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2684568165.html

250's normally go for a lot of money, because of fuel costs these days. That said, I looked up the stats for this bike, and the fuel economy is simply not great. It is the perfect size for a beginner, though, and it's a classic style, and the low mileage is great news for those afraid to get dirty with their new bike. Check the tires for dry rot, as when you're dealing with that low of miles, typically it's been dug out of a shed, made to run, with everything else being an afterthought. It has been dropped.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2690775636.html

This is on the larger end of what I'd recommend, but this model is known to be bulletproof. It's cheap, too.

No EXTRAORDINARY pickings, but there are some good ones.
