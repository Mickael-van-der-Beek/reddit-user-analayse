I was asked a few days ago about doing an AMA on Reddit through Twitter.
I'd like to take the time to do a general AMA properly at some point, but not immediately as i'm currently on quite an intense tour schedule.
However, i was thrilled to see there was significant demand, so how about a casual Q&amp;A here (specifically about production) in the meantime ?

I won't be as constantly available as i'd wish but i'll do my best to reply to questions over the next couple of days.
(Sorry about posting this at night, i just got internet access - hopefully it'll still be visible tomorrow !)

If you have questions besides production, please keep them for now, we'll reconvey ! Now let's geek out for a minute.

EDIT 2: Ok it's obvious that there is a huge amount of interest. Hopefully he gets back to me by tomorrow so this thing can happen sooner or later. I'll keep you posted.

EDIT 3: Just got in contact with Porter Robinson who is also showing some interest in doing an AMA. Not sure if he wants to do it for us or just for r/AMA. Hopefully this develops well. In other news, still nothing back from Madeon. Looks like he hasn't been on Twitter all day.

1367463949.0,336,self.edmproduction,1dj0y0,A list of the best advice I can give new dance music producers.,JacksonGlass,396,60,224,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1dj0y0/a_list_of_the_best_advice_i_can_give_new_dance/,"1. *Read The Fucking Manual.*

Learning to produce is 95% learning how to get what's in your head into your DAW and out your speakers. I can write you the next #1 beatport song in my head right now. I could do five of them right now. So could you. What makes a great producer is someone who can take that idea from their head and get it into reality. That's more or less the only thing that matters. Read the manual to EVERY PRODUCT, DAW, VST, ETC. YOU OWN. It's is the absolute quickest way to learn how to get what's in your head into the real world. SO READ THEM ALL. TWICE.

2. *Learn one thing well and branch out from there.*

Better to learn one synth, one EQ and one DAW until you have it mastered and know it like the back of your hand. It gives you a benchmark with which to compare all other similar devices that you wouldn't have had before. Eventually (and I'm talking years here) you'll find you need to do something your synth/EQ/DAW can't do. That's when you pick up a second. And so on.

3. *If you don't know why you need it, you don't need it.*

No matter what it is: a note, an effect, a section, a buildup, an entire song - if you don't know exactly why you need it, you don't need it. If it's ever a question of whether you should keep or delete something the answer is you should always delete it. (Or put it into a great big misc. folder and save it for some other project in the future. But not this one.)

4. *Sometimes you gotta delete great parts to make great songs.*

It sucks. You won't like doing it. It's painful. But it must be done and you will thank yourself later.

5. *Your volume fader is by far the most powerful mixing tool you have.*

Understand: every single effect in the history of music making is a manipulation of volume. Some are volume + time, like chorus, phasers, etc. Distortion is the volume of certain harmonics. EQ is volume of certain frequencies. Compression is volume over time. That means if you were to make a venn diagram of effects, volume would be the big circle that everything else falls into. It is the most powerful mixing tool on the planet. Use it wisely. 75% of a mix is where you put your volume faders. Get those right first before you ever even think of touching EQ, compression, etc. Those are fine chisels, volume slider is your sledge hammer.

6. *Work intuitively, not rationally.*

The first year or two you start you won't be able to do this. You'll have to think rationally, you'll use the same compression chain your favorite artists use or something like that. But over time, you'll *know* that snare compression attack needs to be slightly longer. Or that reverb isn't helping this synth, it's just muddying up the track. You won't have a rational way of putting this into words so ignore your formal training and go with your intuitive, gut feeling as often as you can.

7. *When in doubt, make it shittier.*

The problem with trying to make something sound 'good' is you inevitably fall into the trap of making music other people have already made - because you know they were successful doing it. If you have writers block or feel like forcing a little bit of creativity out of your fingertips try this exercise. Do a Save As... on your project, and then make it shittier. Do all of the things you would NEVER do. Put a fat phaser on your kick drum. Put a reverb and a bitcrusher on the master chain. Do crazy shit. 90% of it will sound like shit but when you start freeing your mind from The Box the 10% that's good is REALLY good...

8. *Avoid calling it a 'song' for as long as possible.*

Same principle as above. If it's not a song - there's no pressure to make it sound 'good'. This is when you are at your most creative. Encourage yourself to PLAY, DOODLE, HAVE FUN and EXPERIMENT as much as possible. You are not wasting your time. You are not wasting your time. You are not wasting your time.

9. *You're doing it right when it doesn't feel like you wrote the song at all.*

The best feeling in the world is when you don't feel like you wrote the song at all - it feels more like a dusty book cover you found in your grandmothers attic and you're slowly wiping off the dust to reveal the title of the book. Like it was always there and you just discovered it. Seek out this feeling.

10. *There are a million ways to sound good.*

Mixes, especially in the modern day, have absolutely zero set standards to them. Compare two of your favorite songs and you'll find how wildly different they really are. Analyze them. Some have crazy high end, some have zero low end, some have a warm soft middle and some are distorted and wildly in your face. They're all so incredibly different that it's important to learn early on there is NO RIGHT WAY to mix a song. Every mixer has their own style. Find yours by studying a wide variety of well mixed songs and putting your own stamp on the medium.


Go forth and prosper, my children.

I was wondering if people would be interested in tutorials that are geared more towards learning how FM works and less about how to make a certain sound. The reason I'm asking is that I know there are dozens of videos describing how to make a certain sound but they don't cover *why* those sounds are generated. 

Things I would go over include: 

* How to use the frequency ratio effectively.
* Envelope tweaks, linking certain operators to each other to have a bass with a fast, hard attack that settles to a deep sin wave.
* Using the easy/morph tab in FM8 for automation, especially in the envelope sections for opening plucks/basses etc.
* In general how to start from scratch and make a sound you hear in your head.

The biggest decision is whether or not I would just post text threads on /r/edmproduction or do YouTube videos. I have literally no experience in recording for YouTube so text posts would be easier to me just much less intuitive. Let me know what you guys think! 

Edit: Wow! I didn't think I would get this kind of response at all. Now that I know that there's a demand for it then I have nothing stopping me but work at the moment. Because I work through the week I'm thinking about making a tutorial every Friday so that I'll actually be able to spend my undivided attention on making the video/text tutorial whatever. 

To those asking about making it universal to FM that's what I plan on doing. I will be using FM8 but most if not all of the techniques I'll be going over should be able to be applied to any FM synth. I won't really be using FM8 effects, the only ""FM8 exclusive"" features are the ones found in the Master tab and even then I think most of that stuff is universal to all FM synths.

Edit 2: Fuck it, I'll go ahead and make a precursor tutorial today, text only for now.

I went to see mark instinct last night--my ears, of course, were ringing afterwards, pretty badly. When I woke up this afternoon, I was freaking out because they were still ringing really bad and I couldn't make out what anyone was saying to me. I mean, I've had ringing that lasted until the next morning before, but usually I could still hear over it just fine. When I thought of the possibility that it was permanent this time, I started REALLY freaking out and realized how valuable my hearing is to me. As people who want to be able to mix and master music to professional quality, we really need accurate ears that can hear very well, even at the extreme ends of the spectrum!

I think I will be fine after a couple of days, but the reality is that my hearing is probably permanently affected if it takes that long to recover. It may even be an unnoticable difference, but it's irreversible!

By getting these AMA's, we can archive them (as we have on the sidebar ---&gt;) and refer back to these and learn, and grow.

1347980837.0,275,self.edmproduction,102yap,The single most important device that EVERY Ableton Live user should be using on every track in every project file they ever work on.,ZuluCompany,325,50,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/102yap/the_single_most_important_device_that_every/,"[Ableton's Utility Device](http://imgur.com/NJVB9)


My apologies that I can't provide equivalents for all the non-ableton folks out there...Live is the only DAW i'm truly experienced with and being that this device is a native Ableton plug in, i'm not sure how any other DAWs native plug ins function, but with this device, it's more about the concepts.  Simply put, This can't do anything that any other DAW can't do.

So why the Utility?  First of all, it is aptly named.  It is a device you use, it doesn't compress, doesn't enhance or distort, it's just a device that handels the most important utilitarian functions that any producer will need to utilize in just about any track.

So what are these functions?  Your 2 way gain knob.  One of my biggest tips I learned some time ago was to do AS MUCH volume automation as possible on utility devices.  This leaves your channel volume free to adjust as you go, not limited by any automation data.  Simple tip, hugely impact your workflow and mixing decision.  

Secondly, all your channel/pan functions are right there.  MOST IMPORTANTLY is ""Width""  This has also been one of the paramount functions that have enhanced my tracks and my production quality: working with the stereo field.  Example, most producers know that the lower in frequency your sound, the more mono, or centered, you want the sound.  As you move up the spectrum to the very highs, you want a more spread out, or stereo, sound.  Therefore, I end up putting at least one Utility on EVERY track in my project, so when working with pads, higher-up leads, or any big sound that extends in the upper frequency spectrum, I can take the Width value up, even 10-20%.  At 100%, the sound is unaffected.  If you crank it up to 200% it begins rejecting all the mono sound until your left with just the hard stereo sound...it will sound like there's suddenly a hole in the middle.  This can be INCREDIBLY useful, even in small increments, to keep your nice stereo sounds there, but to carve space out of the center so your big mono bass/kick/whatever have less to fight over for punch and presence in the mix.  Conversely, if working on those bass and low sounds, you can take the Width down to reject the stereo information until, if you hit 0%, you have a purely mono sound. These kinds of decisions can be utterly crucial to EDM producers as you want a highly compressed, very loud master yet when you put the limiter on there, your sound is muddy, distorted, and never as loud.  A lot of the times this is just bad mixing, but it can also be a problem with the spacing of your sounds.  Too much mono energy will overload the compressor/limiter, especially if a lot of those sounds are stereo and don't necessarily need to be right in the center.  Use the Width to help carve little bits of a space out to ultimately help give you a better sonic environment, especially at high volumes.  

Finally, your phase correction.  You should, especially if you are unexperienced with phasing, try reversing the phase of every sound in your project, if only to see the effect it can have on your sound.  On a very complex lead patch with my synths stacked and duplicated, it can totally destroy the sound, BUT, on a snare, or hats or percussive bits, you may find that the sound sits in the mix exponentially better with it's phased reversed.  Try it out, get used to hearing the sound of phase reversals. 


So there you have it folks, if you're a Live user, bust out that Utility device and get comfortable with it, it will help make your workflow and overall technique markedly superior.  Those of you in other DAWs, please chime in to let us know how to handle these very basic but very, VERY essential processes that can help take amateur mixes and get them to a pro sound.  

Edit: It's awesome how much discussion this has sparked.  Comments are rife with good tips! I hope this doesn't come off as spammy but I wanted to post my last track that just got released, primarily because it was the first track I started using most of the techniques in this post (maybe that's why it got signed?) but to give an example of how careful control of stereo width, volume automation, all those things, can give your mix space and atmosphere.

[with pictures!],,307,33,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/18zdvk/massive_sound_design_tutorial_part_1_introduction/,"Hey /r/edmproduction, I've been thinking about writing a tutorial on NI Massive (since it's a very popular and common synth) however, I find a lot of YouTube tutorials just teach people who to make ""Skrillox bass"" without teaching how to design sounds yourself. Unfortunately, the manual for Massive does exist, but it's super outdated and unnecessarily detailed. So I've decided to cover the features of the synth, and how you could go about implementing design ideas, to allow people to come up with their own sound ideas. It's much more rewarding than just using presets. :)
Anyway, this is part 1 of the series. I'll be covering the primary oscillator basics first and work in a linear manner from start to finish in the standard routing path. This series assumes you know the very basics of Massive (like how to make a sound) and have a standard level of literacy since my writing tends to be verbose unfortunately. (I wrote a lot of essays.)

[Link to massive manual for further detail if needed.](http://www.ageofaudio.com/pdfs/Massive%20Manual%20English.pdf) Thanks sighsalot!

If you have any questions I will try to answer them below. Also, if anything I mentioned is incorrect let me know and I'll fix it.

Cheers! - Stay tuned for part 2: Modulation and Noise Oscillators.

-------------------
**Introduction To Massive**

Massive is an interesting synth to work with. It can create a wide variety of sounds but what separates it from other subtractive synths is the fact it’s a wavetable synth and for this reason we can take a straight dive into the world of additive synthesis without having to dig quite deep into sound engineering and extremely complicated subjects. [Additive synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_synthesis) is quite difficult to get a hang of. However, we can use pieces of wave lengths created by additive synthesis and manipulate them to our liking in the Massive wavetable synth.

[How does this work? Well have a look at the oscillator tab under “OSC 1” and you will see “Squ-Sw 1” selected. Click that tab and a menu should popup.](http://i.imgur.com/DxI2PUY.png)

That menu is a list of wave samples. That’s right, Massive is a sample based synthesiser! It uses wave samples as oscillator tones allowing for some really cool and gnarly sounds. Unlike subtractive synthesizers (like the minimoog) which generate “tones” like the [sine wave or the square wave.](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Waveforms.svg/500px-Waveforms.svg.png) Massive doesn't generate tones, but rather uses wavetable samples for its oscillators. :)

*In Summary...*

* Massive is a wavetable virtual synthesizer.
* It uses a much more simple form of additive synthesis.
* It uses samples known as “wavetables” for oscillators and does not generate tones like normal subtractive synths.

---------------------
**Wt-Position**

[Those with more indepth knowledge of Massive will be familiar that a wavetable does not include just “one” sampled waveform, rather “multiple” waveforms that make up a wavetable and can be scrolled through using the WT-Position knob under the oscillator tab.](http://i.imgur.com/MwTjjpC.png)

The WT-Position knob will allow you to select from a variety of waveforms included in the wavetable. These waveforms morph from a certain wave form to another waveform.

[Under the global tab, select ""init patch"" (small square button, top left corner in the global tab interface).](http://i.imgur.com/Ctv32Qx.png) This will give you a fresh patch to start off with in massive. If you notice, when a midi note is played, you can here a tone being played. Select ""Sin-Square"" from the wavetable menu. Now, move the “WT-Position” knob all the way to the left and you will hear a “softer” tone. That is a sine wave being played. But notice, if you move the “WT-Position” knob in to the right and play a note, you will here a note that sounds like a square wave. All wavetables that you can select all have two “basic” tones that morph into each other as you move the “WT-Position” knob.

[To get a visual idea check this site out.](http://quadrophone.com/massive-wavetable-images/)

The left picture represents the left basic waveform of the wavetable and the right picture represents the right basic waveform of the wavetable.

*In Summary...*

* A wavetable in massive can generate multiple waveforms.
* You can select a wavetable under the popdown menu.
* A wavetable in massive has two basic tones. The basic tones are the “WT-Position” scrolled all the way to the left and all the way to the right.
* You can morph between the two basic tones by moving the “WT-Position” knob.

-----------------------
**Intensity**

[Even the most advanced users of massive may not have any idea of what “intensity” represents in the massive synthesizer. We know it manipulates the oscillator’s tone somewhat. But what does it actually do?](http://i.imgur.com/tl1YxFs.png)

Let’s go back a bit to understand what is going on.

We know massive generates tones from wavetables. The Oscillator generates the selected waveform from your choice and then what? The sound is routed to the intensity knob. This is where the first manipulation of the sound happens.

*Selected Tone* -----&gt; *Intensity* -----&gt; …

What may come as a surprise to many advanced massive users (I didn't even know this) is the fact the manipulation of the intensity knob completely depends on the oscillator mode. [The oscillator mode? Yes, it’s that other popup menu next to the wavetable selection. You know, “Spectrum, Bend +, Bend -/+, Bend - and Formant?”](http://i.imgur.com/Jb7uHZy.png) Yes, it’s that button you only had a slim clue how to use and now you will finally know.

Let’s start with the ***spectrum mode***. It’s the default mode for the oscillator. Spectrum mode basically works like a low-pass filter and reduces high frequency harmonics heard from the waveform.

Start with an “init-patch” and under spectrum mode: turn the knob to the left. What happens to the waveform? It’s softer sounding and has filtered the high frequencies. Turn the knob to the right fully and you’re back at your original waveform.

Simple isn't it?

Now, let’s move on to something more difficult. ***The bend modes***! Muahaha (it’s not actually that scary). What does the bend mode do? Well, it will shape the readout curve of the waveform by speeding the readout up or by slowing it down. It’s a very strange effect and can really produce some neat sounds when used correctly.

But I’m being too broad. So let’s look at an example to see how this works.

[Look at this picture.](http://i.imgur.com/3vZo8Up.png)

This is my waveform. I’m going to set the oscillator mode to Bend -/+ and set the intensity all the way to the left:

[Now look at my waveform.](http://i.imgur.com/2imcjHB.png)

It might be difficult to see at first what is actually going on. Let me explain. Massive is stretching and compressing my waveform. It’s compressing the beginning of the waveform and the end of the waveform while stretching the middle.

[Let’s move the intensity knob all the way to the right and have a look at the waveform again.](http://i.imgur.com/JBZUOBD.png)

This time Massive has done the opposite. It has completely compressed the middle of the waveform and stretched the ends of the waveform.

[Now let’s move the intensity knob back to the middle and have a look at our waveform again.](http://i.imgur.com/n8Oi5lg.png)

Familiar, isn’t it? ;)

Okay, I get it. But what is the deal with the Bend - and Bend + modes?

Same thing. Really. [On bend - turning the intensity knob all the way to the left gives me the original. Turning the knob to the right gives me the thing as turning the Bend -/+ to the left.](http://i.imgur.com/5q84fXe.png) [On bend + turning the intensity all the way to the left gives me the same waveform and turning the knob all the way to the right gives me the same thing as turning Bend -/+ to the right.](http://i.imgur.com/QPbInUG.png) So what’s the point of ""Bend -"" and ""Bend +"" if I already have [bend -/+](http://i.imgur.com/Xlzmif6.png)? It just allows for greater precision.

[Confusing? Yes. But give me a break, have you seen the manual? Yeah, they couldn't really explain it either.](http://i.imgur.com/Q44pk1f.png)

That’s basically it for the bend mode. Now for ***The Formant*** mode. This mode manipulates additional transposition of the waveform formants. It’s an interesting effect I won’t go into too much detail with (you do have Google after all)… Think of it like this: If I play a tone in Massive and set the mode to “formant” I will be able to manipulate the transposition (think of the word “transpose”) with the intensity knob you can create vowel-like sounds (you know, A-E-I-O-U) without un-stabilising the pitch. Neat, huh?

If you want to see what this sounds like for yourself, try making the characteristic dubstep vowel sound. Select the “modern-talking” wavetable and set the mode to formant. Then with your mouse move the intensity knob up or down to select between different vowel-like sounds. :)

*In Summary...*

* An oscillator’s mode is manipulated by the “intensity” knob.
* There are 3 different modes: Spectrum, Bend, Formant.
* Spectrum mode acts like a low-pass filter.
* Bend mode compresses your waveform either at the ends (-) or at the middle (+) of a waveform.
* Formant mode changes the transpose of a sound (stable pitch) to create vowel-like sounds.

---------------------------
**[More of the Oscillator Section](http://i.imgur.com/o745bEt.png)**

**1. Amp**

If you haven’t noticed already, I haven’t covered the Amp knob. You can relax if you don’t know what amplification is. This knob controls the volume of your oscillator. It’s that simple. Turn the knob to the right and you blast the oscillator’s sound. Turn it all the way to the left and you mute the oscillator.

**2. Pitch**

The number associated with an oscillator is the pitch control of the oscillators sound. 0 is default and will play the same key you are playing on your midi keyboard. Adding 1+/- to the pitch control will play the octave ONE NOTE higher or lower. 12+/- is ONE OCTAVE higher or lower than the midi note you are playing. Anything .01 – .99 refers to changes ~~semi-tones~~ in cents.  (inb4 “WHAT?! THERE ARE TONES IN BETWEEN THE KEYBOARD NOTES?” “YES THEY ARE CALLED CENTS BRO.”)

**3. Oscillator On/Off**

See this button? That’s that just an on/off switch. It just turns on or off the oscillator.

**4. Mysterious Arrows?**

What do these do? They just scroll left or right between wavetables. It’s so you don’t actually have to open the menu each time.

**5. More Oscillators?**

Massive comes with 3 main oscillators labelled “OSC 1”, “OSC 2” and “OSC 3”. They all work exactly the same.

**6. F1 – F2 Slider**

This refers to the next stage of sound manipulation for the oscillator tones. They are then routed to both/or filter 1 and 2. Moving the slider fully to F1 routes the sound to Filter 1, moving the slider fully to F2 routes the sound to Filter 2. Keeping the slider in the middle will route the sound equally to both Filter 1 and Filter 2

If you're EQing additively there's a good chance that the other sounds are too loud.

* Another way to EQ subtractively is to EQ *additively* but then bring down the volume so that the peak on the EQ is at -0dB.

* If you're producing in your bedroom or a room with a bed or couch or similar furniture, lie down on your bed and close your eyes while your music plays before you decide what needs to be worked on. Avoiding a DAW interface sometimes helps me make decisions.

* (In fl studio at least) you can get a cool distorted bassdrum (somewhat like [flying lotus's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfrXUvneS4E)) by using an 808 kick with a short tail and putting a compressor on the fx chain with a high (~4:1) ratio, a ~1ms attack and a ~2ms release and add make-up gain to taste. Then, throw fully wet, 100 - 400ms decay reverb on that bad boy. It should sound pretty neat. Use non-bassdrum samples if you like. Just make sure that it doesn't sound horrible in mono or split the sound into two copies, one lowpassed at 250Hz and made mono and the other highpassed at 250Hz and as stereophonic as you desire.

* When trying to manipulate sounds (I like doing this with leads and vocals in particular), send a copy to a new mixer channel and put all the effects you would regularly use on the origin sound at 100% wet. Do your side-chaining on the wet channel.

* Side-chain 100% wet channels with a silent (i.e. plays through mixer but doesn't get sent to master channel) kick. Works well when played at double speed compared to the regular kick.

* If you happen to be the kind of deviant pervert that compresses the breathing space out of the master channel and you find yourself unable to hear individual sounds, try turning down the release and  ratio and make-up gain a little bit and turn up the threshold, *and* turn down the volume of any sounds (leads and bass in particular) that don't change volume much / that are constant

* When you have quarter note hi hats playing constantly, add a teeny-weeny bit of reverb and oscillate the panning of the hats at a 1/4 sorta tempo.

* *(This is an important one! That I also learned on this forum somewhere &lt;3)* To find out what's too loud (forgetting about [fletcher-munson curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fletcher%E2%80%93Munson_curves)), turn your headset or speakers or monitors all the way down to -96dB or whatever. Then slowly turn it up. The first thing you'll hear is the loudest sound, which you'll probably want to turn down. You can also do this in the opposite direction by slowly turning the volume down until you can't hear one of your sounds.

* Reverse a sample, eq and reverb it, then re-reverse it. Boom, backwards reverb. Backwards delay sounds cool too.

* I *dare* you to reverse a sample with high melodic content (e.g. guitar or sax or voice), throw a 100% wet autotune-like VST on that channel, hall-verb it then re-reverse ish. Them sounds be cray.

* If you have multiple sounds on different channels with exact copies of an effect chain, send them all to a group channel with a copy of that particular effect chain to save CPU processing.

1327037286.0,215,self.edmproduction,oohf1,10 tips for chord progressions from a jazz musician,parker_greene,231,16,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/oohf1/10_tips_for_chord_progressions_from_a_jazz/,"A lot of people have been asking for help with chord progressions and music theory. I'm a novice producer, but I do have a jazz degree, so I thought this would be a good opportunity for me to give something back to this subreddit. I will assume that you know the basics about notes, intervals, and building chords. For all examples, I will be using the key of C.

**Tip #1.** If you're trying to come up with complicated and unique chord progressions, you're wasting your time. There are only 12 notes and all combinations that sound good have been used before. Stick to something simple. You're making EDM, so the chords are not the main focus here. Pick 2 or 3 main chords to focus on. Other chords will only be used to get you from point A to point B in a harmonically logical way. I will demonstrate some tools you can use to achieve this.

**Tip #2. Progressive &amp; regressive motion.** If you aren't very familiar with music theory, chord progressions might seem very complicated to you, but all progressions can be broken down into very simple core functions. The V-I relationship is the most important one in western music. It is so powerful because of the half-step relationship between the 3rd of the V chord and the root of the I chord. When you're going from V to I, you're going up a perfect fourth (P4) or down a perfect fifth (P5), which is one of the most common chord motions. This type of motion is called ""progressive"", as it sounds like you're moving forward. A ""regressive"" motion is the opposite, i.e. I-V, or up a P5 or down a P4. Regressive motions sound like you're taking a step back from your ultimate harmonic goal. They are less stable and usually require you to go back in a progressive motion (think I-V-I cadence, the ending of countless classical pieces). Progressive and regressive motions do not have to be between I and V, they can exist between any chord. iii-vi-ii-V-I (Em-Am-Dm-G7-C) is an example of a ""progressive"" chord progression and is very common in jazz. Remember, progressive motions move up by P4 or down by P5, while regressive motions go down by P4, or up by P5.

**Tip #3.** Progressive motions are a good way to make your way back to your home key. Say you're sitting on an A chord and you're trying to end up back at C. Simple -- go up by P4 or down by P5: A-D-G-C. Regressive motions are useful if you don't really want to leave the chord you're on, but you want some kind of temporary change to make your song more interesting. Just go down a P4 or up a P5 and come right back.

**Tip #4.** Moving by only fourths and fifths is boring, so use any other interval to break up the pattern. There are no rules for this, just try things and see what sounds good. My favorite motions are down a major third (C -&gt; Ab), down a major second (C -&gt; Bb), and up a minor third (C -&gt; Eb).

**Tip #5. Tritone substitutions.** Remember all that stuff about progressive and regressive motions? Say you start at C, then go up a minor third to Eb. If you want to move progressively back to C, it would take forever: C-Eb-Ab-Db-Gb-B-E-A-D-G-C. That's a lot of chords! Luckily, there's a shortcut that allows you to use much fewer chords while still maintaining a progressive motion. It’s called a ""tritone substitution"". Basically, you can substitute any chord in your progression with a chord that is a tritone away (tritone = 3 whole steps = half octave). It doesn't work well with all chords, so you have to use your ear to see if it sounds good, but it will almost always work with dominant chords (Major chords with flat 7ths). So now, ""progressive"" doesn't just mean up a P4 or down a P5, it also includes moving down by a half-step. As you will soon see, this will often make it easier to move progressively towards your home key: C-Eb-D-G-C. I used a tritone sub for Ab, which is D, which made it easier for me to get back to C. So to reiterate, tritone subs enable a progressive root movement down a half-step (Eb-D). Similarly, root movements up a half-step are regressive.

**Tip #6.** Tritone subs aren't just useful as shortcuts. They also sound cool in general because the ear tends to like half-step relationships. So instead of a I-V-I (C-G-C), which is fairly boring, try a tritone sub on the V (C-Db-C). Often you can successfully incorporate both progressions at the same time on different tracks (Ex: use C-G-C for your bass, but C-Db-C for your synth chords -- this works even better if you use Db7 instead of Db; remember tritone subs work best with dominant chords).

**Tip #7.** You may have noticed that thus far I have not mentioned any major/minor qualities. The reason is that the most important thing in a chord progression is logical root movements. Sometimes minor chords will sound better than major ones and vice versa, but then again, in many cases either will work -- it just depends on what kind of sound you're looking for. If you want to stay in a given scale or mode, build chords using only the notes in that key. Some chords will end up minor, some will end up major, and some will end up diminished or augmented. Take the key of C major -- it has no sharps or flats (C-D-E-F-G-A-B). If you build a chord starting on the second note, you'll end up with D minor (D-F-A). If you build a chord starting on the fourth note, you'll end up with F major (F-A-C). Finally, if you build a chord starting on the seventh note, you'll end up with B diminished (B-D-F). It's the same way with all major scales. However, there's no law against going outside the key. If you don't like a chord that's coming out minor, change it to maj/dim/aug and see if you like the sound. Just make sure you stick with logical root movements, and you'll be fine.

**Tip #8. Jazzy chords.** If you're looking for that warm jazzy sound in your chord progression, it's easy to achieve using chord extensions. Regular chords are built using 1, 3, and 5 of the scale -- to make them jazzy you just have to add extensions (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths). For most EDM purposes, I'd keep things simple and just stick with 7ths and 9ths. If you are using a major chord, you have two options for a 7th - either major 7th or a flat 7th. The major 7th is the note one half-step below the root, while the flat 7th is a whole step below the root. In the key of C, you get either C-E-G-B (Cmaj7) or C-E-G-Bb (C7). The former will sound more jazzy/lougey, while the latter will sound more bluesy. The C7 chord is an example of a dominant chord and typically requires a progressive motion to follow. When using a major 7th, use the natural 9th (which is also the 2nd of the scale) - so you get C-E-G-B-D. The 9th doesn't really change the sound of the chord, but it thickens it. When using a flat 7th, you can use either the natural 9th for a more stable sound (C-E-G-Bb-D), or a flat/sharp 9 for a less stable sound that will require a progressive motion to follow (Ex: C-E-G-Bb-Db or C-E-G-Bb-D#). When using minor chords, you want to use flat 7ths and natural 9ths (C-Eb-G-Bb-D), although the natural 7th may be used for a mysterious sort of sound (C-Eb-G-B). Jazzy chords are particularly useful for deep house and liquid funk.

**Tip #9. Chord inversions.** So far I've built all chords from the root up. Generally you want to avoid that, because it will make your progression sound choppy. To smooth out the flow of chords, you have to invert your chords in various ways. By inversion, I simply mean changing the order of the notes: C-E-G-Bb -&gt; E-G-Bb-C -&gt; G-Bb-C-E. In this example, I've taken the chord from its root position to the first inversion and to the second inversion. When inverting 3-note chords, you shouldn't have any problems. However, you may have problems when inverting chords with 4 or more notes. In my example, the first inversion was E-G-Bb-C. While it doesn't sound that bad, the fact that there is only one whole step between the top note and the next note down can be problematic. It's a good idea to have at least a step and a half (minor third) between the top two notes of the chord in order to avoid dissonance. In this case, because it’s a jazzy chord, I would just replace the root (C) with the 9th (D) -- remember, 9ths don't change the sound of the chord, so it is a fair substitution. Another thing to keep in mind is that in chords with 4 or more notes, it is usually a good idea to avoid the root, because it is likely already playing in the bass. If inversions make sense, you're ready for my final tip.

**Tip #10. Practice good voice leading.** You could take a semester or two learning about proper voice leading… or you could just use common sense. Basically, when you move from chord to chord, you want to minimize the motion of individual notes. If two adjacent chords have any notes in common, those notes should be left alone. For the notes that have to change, you want them to move the smallest distance possible. In order to achieve this, you’ll have to try out different inversions and see which one minimizes the overall motion of individual notes. This is not always easy, but if you do it right, your progression will sound smooth and pleasant to the ear.

I hope this is useful for those of you who are struggling with chord progressions. If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them as best as I can.

I see a lot of recommendations that people should ""learn music theory"" to improve their compositions, but this
is an enigmatic and vague instruction that often leaves people with no idea of where to start or how to approach it.
I aim to help people who have little to no understanding of music theory get a grasp of the fundimentals.  Like anything else in life
music is built off of having solid fundimentals which will translate into spectacular things when chained together.  Art masterpieces
are made by using the same fundimental brush strokes and colors to create infinitely varied works.  To have a good
understanding of music theory you have to start with a basic understanding of it and work your way up.  

I have a background in guitar so my theory education is heavily biased towards guitar applicable techniques,
but doing electronic music production I find myself using the same concepts of melody and chordal movement/resolution
that are found in all rock and guitar based music.  I am also going to be using some common nomenclature among musicians like roman numerals where appropriate, because music theory is ultimately a way for musicians to communicate with each other.  It's a way to easily
explain what you are playing (like saying I am playing in the key of F#) so that other people can play in the same key and sound good.


This post is REALLY long so I am going to put the bulk of the lesson in the comments.  Bear in mind that these are pretty deep concepts and it took me a long time to understand this.  If you don't get it at first, don't be discouraged because like most things in life you have to put in a lot of effort to really grasp these concepts.

1357488008.0,193,self.edmproduction,162b4t,I'm going to write a no-bullshit approach on how to achieve loudness. [Long Read] ,,237,44,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/162b4t/im_going_to_write_a_nobullshit_approach_on_how_to/,"Edit: (((I fucking hate the loudness wars, and cannot wait till loudness regulations are put in place so people focus more on the musical content and clarity rather than loudness, but for now its important to understand this technique which really makes a huge difference. If you produce very dynamic and minimal stuff, I wouldn't recommend this, but if you make heavy slamming tracks such as jump up drum and bass/heavy dubstep and loud house productions, then this is for you. Always render out two copies of your track, one simply with a limiter with about 2-3db of gain reduction to put up on youtube/soundcloud so it sounds great, and hand out the stupidly loud one for DJs. Your music will still sound crushed no matter what you do, but this will make it sound a lot more bearable and of course, louder)))





(This isn't for people just starting out, I'm assuming you know your way round a compressor and an eq, if not some searches on Youtube will most probably help you out a lot, listen to the ones with very high ratings and good feedback from people in the comments).

This is for the producers that are at a point where they feel like they know their shit pretty well, they've got some pretty neat support both from fans and relatively well-known/successful producers/DJs and because their stuff is getting support, its maybe being played on the radio or on internet radio stations and clubs which means one thing - their track is being played physically side-by-side with another track, then BOOM, WELCOME TO THE LOUDNESS WARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

You suddenly think:

'Well Fuck'

'Why can't I hear my track'

'How is their track so loud when my track also hits 0db just like theirs'

'I want my track as loud as theirs, this is fucking embarrassing'.

Trust me, I know these feels, I still struggle with it now, but this is why I'm writing this, to settle this for people to actually know how to make tracks loud.

Just to recap, there are 3 stages of production.

1: Writing/Recording of the music

2: Mixdown

3: Mastering

Want to know where the 'loud' bit comes in? Its in number 2, the mixdown.

Stop looking for the latest limiter 'wItH tHE BEsT lOUDneSs AlGorIThIMs', if your mix isn't right it will sound just as good as the one your DAW has provided you with.

Firstly, you have to ironically work backwards to see where the things in your song are actually causing harm which are most probably the things making your track relatively quiet. The last thing you should apply to your track, right at the end of the mastering stage is a limiter, and its this which people always associate with loudness, which is understandable, but think what you're feeding through it. If you have a track with a vocal and loads of peaks (basically punchy loud things that look like spikes when you look at your track's waveform), if you feed that in to the limiter, what do you think its going to limit first? The quiet vocal or the fucking loud bad-ass punchy drums? You're right, its the drums. 

Now, think of this. If you want your track to be as loud as a Noisia track, you can easily pull down this limiter till its as loud as a Noisia track, so all's cool. But wait, now where are your drums? They've been limited so much they're now a big distorted squashy mess, losing all their punchy character and tone...well fuck.

So how can we manage to push a limiter hard without losing the punch in the drums?

The first thing the limiter recognized was the peaks, so if we made the drums quieter (with the same peak as the vocal), suddenly the waveform will look *more* consistent and flatter. Now, when you pull the limiter down, you have all that extra headroom which you saved from turning down the drums, so now you can push it harder without it distorting the drums as much, but wait...everything's good and loud but I can hardly hear the drums because I've turned them down...well fuck, now what?

Aha! Here we are! THIS is the secret! 

In order for you to hear the drums on top of the vocal, without turning the drums up, you can use an eq and find which are the main frequencies that help push the drum sound out. So if you have a snare drum, you'll find that most of it's punch is usually around 200hz, and its snap is around 2000hz, so now what you can do, is simply create a 2-3db cut in the vocal at these two places, so when the snare hits, these two important frequencies which make the snare heard in the song now have extra headroom, and you haven't even needed to turn the snare up! You've ended up turning down frequencies in other areas of the song which take up the snare's space, so now the snare is snapping through nicely AND its not being distorted any near as much on the limiter WOOOOOOOOOO.

You pretty much do this with EVERY sound. 

Using that snare and vocal example, if you find that cutting 200hz from the vocal to make room for the snare ruins the sound of the vocal, you can use sidechain compression, either on a single band or multiband compressor.

Here's some info if you're new to sidechain compression (assuming you know what compression is, but if not just those eq cuts should at least help for now, but if you want to get tracks super loud you will need to know and use compression a lot).

Sidechain compression: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Prd-LtH9_DE

Basically what sidechain compression does is, you link two mixer channels together. So in this case it would be the snare mixer bus, and the vocal mixer buss. You would put a compressor with sidechain capabilities on the vocal mixer bus. You would then sidechain the snare's signal to the compressor put on your vocal mixer bus. Through some tweaking, every time the snare hits in your song, it will turn DOWN the volume of the vocal very quickly, just for the duration of the snare, so now you don't even need to cut the eq to make room for the snare, you can simply just turn down the vocal for the snare to be heard using a compressor!

Search for a multiband compressor called 5ORCERY, its free! Basically you can do the same thing however, with this you can sidechain the vocal so it only dips a specific frequency range, rather than the WHOLE vocal, meaning the snare will cut through, and you won't get a pump in the vocal, so its more transparent! 


This is simply the best way to achieve loudness, with nearly every sound in your song, you have to find the other sound in your song which clashes with it (this creates peaks which we don't want), and you either sidechain or create eq cuts where needed. If you want to know which sounds in your song are peaking, simply play the song, watch the master volume fader and whenever it goes up really high, try and listen to what it actually causing it to peak, its most probably either a kick drum, snare or a powerful bassy sound. 

Obviously applying subtle comrpession on nearly every sound in your mix will help loudness too, but basically what this method does it is allows you to create the flattest mix as possible, you have to use your ears but basically anything that peaks stupidly (little peaks are fine so don't get TOO paranoid about peaks), but if something is using a lot of headroom, turn it down a little, and then cut/compress other sounds which are covering it up. 

You will then find that when you get to the mastering stage you can push the limiter harder, making your track very loud and still very clear and punchy! 

Edit: 

Just in case it gets buried, here's a great tip from 'joemaley' for how to know what sounds are peaking in your mix.

'Good read, one thing that really helps me is watching the peak on the master track. For example, turn all your instruments but one. Then add another, if the next instrument raises the peak of the master, that one needs to be compressed or lowered to the previous. If everything is EQ'd correctly, there should be no increase in the 'peak', it just sounds louder because you've filled out more of the frequency spectrum.'

You obviously don't have to, but if you want to hear the difference this technique has made for me at least, here are two comparisons. 

[Not using this technique](http://soundcloud.com/official-flexx-artist/4flexx-intolerance-clip)

[Using this technique](http://soundcloud.com/official-flexx-artist/4flexx-forget)

I'm aware they're two different tracks but there's still a noticeable difference in terms of clarity and perceived loudness.

Edit: Sorry for swearing, I'm British and have had a lot of coffee to drink. @_@

Edit: I also stupidly forgot to mention which 'ZuluCompany' did, when wanting to see which frequencies are most probably troublesome within your mix, download [Voxengo Span](http://www.voxengo.com/product/span/), yet again another free plugin that even Noisia themselves use, its absolutely fantastic. As well as routing, it can give you an RMS readout as well, so you can actually check the RMS of your mix as an optional extra to help boost the loudness, but remember, if the RMS goes up but it doesn't sound any louder, then it won't be any louder, but its still useful as it can let you know if a compressor is doing its job or not :).

1359443688.0,179,self.edmproduction,17hh83,Sound design vs composition,pistacchio,196,17,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/17hh83/sound_design_vs_composition/,"Hi,
this discussion is motivated by my curiosity. It seems to me that most of the focus of topics, questions and tutorials, not only here but in the music producers' community in general, revolve around **sound design** and the matter of what notes (composition) those sounds should play is neglected as it is of secondary importance.

Let me clarify. A simple example is the bar here at the right. Sample packs, recipes on how to make certain synth sounds, faqs about EQ and compression... If you look for *""[Your favorite DAW] tutorial""* on Google, you're probably provided with hundreds of links like ""Sidechaining in Ableton"", ""Skrillex-like bass in Logic""; those tutorials generally are like ""Ok, this is our pad chord progression, I won't tell you how I composed it: now let's spend the following 40 minutes giving it a dark ambient evolving sound"".

Personally, I'd love to read more things like:

* Coming up with an interesting chord progression
* Catching melodies: how to evolve them from simple ideas starting from your harmony
* Got a melody? A simple guide to harmonize it
* Binding the bass to the drum and the harmony
* Escape the 3-note chords and add variety with these jazz-inspired chords
* Changing key: how to add a twist to your song by switching it
* Major or minor? An exploration of alternative keys
* Example drum beats in odd, not 4/4 signatures
* Counterpoint: Take your progressive house tune to the next level by adding a secondary lead that flirts with the main melody
* Classy tunes: orchestrate a string section to replace your synth pads
* Add variation to chords with interesting voicings

I'm making up faux-titles mimicking those found for the latest ""wobbling bass sound"" or ""beat repeater secrets"" tutorials. 

In the end, I'm just curious why the stress is on the ""sound"" part and not on the ""compositional"" part. Is it because everyone is already a music graduate with years of experience in classical music and orchestration but new to synths? Everybody is happy with a kick-snare-kick-snare drum with a root-note-on-the-beat bass and just tries to make it different with a chain of effects and a new, fat bass sound?

It seems to me strange that there are so few down-to-earth articles about composition for electronic music. I guess most of us know the basics of music theory (and it's full of ""what is a chord"" tutorials), but probably couldn't follow a very in depth, university-level class about counterpoint with examples taken form Rimsky-Korsakov scores. Nonetheless they would take advantage of simpler composition tutorials using the piano rolls and the DAWs we are used to instead of very complex examples drawn from jazz or classical music and messy scores not all of us can read.

One outcome of this is that many critique requests by self proclaiming newbies are songs that sound good but are terribly unimaginative, repetitive and lack any sort of memorable melody, and the comments are in the vain of ""add more compression to the kick to make it more punchy"".

I'm not talking about an obsession about ""that sound"", but let's face it: rock music has been producing diverse, catching and era-defining songs for the last 60 years with the same sounding drums, guitars and bass. The fact that electronic music puts you in control of the sound and right on the mixing console shouldn't mean that one can single hand skip the composition part and just try to ""make it sound great"" the most repetitive and overused loops one can find in a sample pack.

Maybe it's just my background as a classical music lover and progressive rock fan, but I'd find it million times more interesting a discussion starting with ""How did Mike Oldfield make five different melodies live together at the same time in this part of Tubular Bells without sounding messy"" than the hundredth discussion on ""How to make this Deadmau5 sound"" :P I mean, you can still load up a preset and tweak knobs at random till you hear something you like, but you can't throw out notes at random and come up with the tune of the year by accident!

In the end, am I missing something, or why most discussion are like ""Ok, this is the bass line, make it super fat"" and not ""Ok, this is a standard bass from the Ableton library, let's make it a super interesting walking bass line""?

I went through a stupid naive stage where I would either download cracked plugins or buy them if I saw they did something cool and immediately made the assumption that I would make better music because of it, I was wrong. Yeah sure they work, brilliantly in most cases, but they don't really help, they're just an addition which I most probably didn't need. 

I use FL Studio, been using it for just over a year and decided a few weeks ago to read up on EVERYTHING about it, there was a shit load of things I never even knew it was capable of that made my life so much easier and has opened me up to many ideas. I always viewed the plugins that come with DAWs as very cheap and poorly made, but you'd be surprised at how good some of them are, and how useful some can be, no matter how good/bad they look. If it sounds good, it sounds good. It doesn't matter how much you went against the rules of music, if it fucking sounds good, IT SOUNDS GOOD. I use to compress tracks very subtly, but sometimes I would compress a little harder than usual and it would sound brilliant, but I'd think 'No I can't compress that much I should only compress a little because that's what I've read from these big people and they're right because they're successful'. Fuck it, if it sounds good then bloody do it. 

Learn your DAW and every plugin it has, and all the ones you currently have, and don't go fishing for new ones just because your mates or people you look up to use them, only get one if you TRULY need it or you'd either be wasting money or increasing your chances of getting caught for downloading illegal material. 

Knowing every plugin inside-out is far more effective than having a hard drive packed with plugins that you only know very little about. 

Break the rules, stop feeling guilty, I did this and it only held me back. The guidelines are good so you know where to fall back to if all else fails, but every track is different, every sample is different, there are different guidelines for different genres so only stick to advice closely if it relates to your style/genre, if not, most definitely take it in and take what you can from it, but don't let it hold you back! 

Go mad and fuk da police.

These are just tips and tricks I've learned out of my 7 years of ~~producing~~ attempting to produce. 


**A little background about me**


I started producing about 7 years ago when I was in jr. high. My parents would never get me an instrument or get me lessons. Instead of letting that defeat my feeling that I was born to write music, I did some research for myself and found out about electronic production. I became friends with Adam Young of Owl City, he gave me some pointers and I was on my way. From that point on I've just continued to learn. I think the hardest part of producing (for me) was not having anyone to help me out who knew anything about DAWs. These are just some things I wish people would have told me sooner. So, here we go!


**1. Writers block**

At some point in our writing process, all of us run into writers block. Overcoming it can be a real bitch at times. Some days are just better than others and that's the way it works. However, sometimes I go through periods where I have writers block for days. I overcome this by working on other things. Doesn't have to be music, it can be anything. Sometimes your brain needs a break from having to process the so much of the same stuff. Just like your ears get fatigued after wearing monitors for hours, your brain gets fatigued as well.

Personally, I like to work on other songs and give the one I'm stuck on a break. I know a lot of people (especially on here) say ""Finish songs, finish songs!!!!"" I agree, but sometimes it's not that easy. Go to something else, come back with a clear head and you'd be surprised at what new ideas come to you.


**2. That dreaded ""not good enough"" feeling**


As producers we all get that ""this track sucks"" or ""this doesn't sound like *insert artist you admire*'s tracks at all"". After you've heard something **so much** you develop these feelings. 


Some things you really need to remember. The artists your wanting to have your tracks sounding like more than likely have been making music for a lot longer than you and at one point they were in your position. They also (more than likely) worked with professionals of some sort. Artists that do everything themselves and have ace sounding tracks probably put in countless hours of work and practice. You have to do the same. No one said it was gonna be easy. This is something you have to develop patience with and keep working at even when you're not happy with your sounds. 


It has actually been scientifically proven that we, as humans, like other peoples stuff better than our own. A study was done with t-shirts. Long story short, a vast majority of people said they liked their ""opponents"" shirt better than the one they selected. Yes, you read that right, they had the option to pick between two shirts (that were secretly identical) and in the end said they liked the other one better after someone else picked it. 

I found this really inspirational because you need to think about your tracks like that. Remember how much you **loved** that track when you first started it. That's the feeling people are going to have when they hear it for the first time. How do you think AC/DC feels about ""Thunderstuck""? How do you think Daft Punk feels about ""One More Time""? They have heard/played that song so many fucking times they probably want to puke, but there's people that have heard it just as much as them and **still** love those songs. 


**3. Experiment // Be original // Explore**


I understand this an EDM production sub, but guys, be creative. Explore other genres. Be a diverse producer. Who cares if you're not a rapper, try making a hip hop beat sometime. Try making an ambient track. Try making a rock track. Push yourself. Test yourself. How good of a producer are you really? Find out for yourself and just experiment. No one said you have to release that stuff, but you may learn something new and it also helps with writers block.


I solely produced electronic pop/dance pop for the longest time. I just tried to mimic my favorite artists. While trying to mimic your favorite artists can be beneficial, eventually you have to develop your own sound. A year ago I said ""I want to produce an RnB inspired album"". Today I sit here listening to some of the final mix downs and I'm surprised with myself. I'm not an Rnb singer, a rapper, or really a musician at that. I'm an artist. We're all artists. One day I might write music, another I may write a book. Another I might paint. Do whatever you want. Put a fuckin flanger on your clap and distortion on your vocal samples, whatever. 


This includes listening to a wide array of music. Don't just listen to dubstep or pop or rock. Listen to a huge mix of everything. Pay attention to the arrangement. Listen to the lyrics. Listen to the production techniques. 


**4. Practice, practice, practice!**


Do something musically **at least** an hour a day. Whether it be production, practicing theory, writing lyrics, playing guitar, anything. It may not seem beneficial initially, but you are exposing your brain to an environment that needs to become natural. Production is just like everything else. The more you practice, the better you'll get.


Everyone does their own thing here. I personally sing over my own stuff. I make it a point to write new lyrics every day. Am I going to use everything I write? Realistically, no, but a lot of times I take lines from one set of lyrics and put them with another and end up getting a song. 


**5. A POSITIVE ATTITUDE**


This is the most important thing I've found while in the studio (and in life). Be optimistic. Love the art you are creating. It is impossible to write a song that is universally well liked. Just because Producer Jack didn't like it, doesn't mean it's bad. You are expressing yourself. Do that however you need to. Do you!


When your riding in the car, sitting in class with free time, on your day off, whatever, make it apparent to practice something musically. 



These are all just tips that I've found that have helped my production. They may have been stated here before, but I just thought I'd share my two cents. 


Don't give up guys. It may not come natural right off the bat. All that bullshit that musicians are **only** born and not made is a load of horse shit. If you want it, you'll get it.

Give it a good listen. It’s quite versatile and it almost singlehandedly drives the buildup and release throughout this track.

[Here’s your MIDI file](http://www.mediafire.com/?ugihcnllqq1dt5c) for today. Open up a blank project in your favorite DAW and let’s get started.

**The Key**

A pluck is formed by a rich sound source that’s acted upon by [a low-pass filter with a characteristic envelope](http://i.imgur.com/IJsYH.png). Unison adds to the unique character of today’s pluck.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* A few oscillators, unisoned.

* A low-pass filter, 24 dB (""Lowpass 4"" in Massive), with pluck envelope.

This is the domain of Sylenth1, Massive, Thor and Sytrus. Operator won’t do at all (unless you use a chorus effect to simulate polyphony), and Oatmeal (see [Recipe 2!](http://redd.it/109wrb)) will fall just short of the *full* effect, for reasons we’ll get into in a second.

**Get Cooking**

1. First, let’s prepare our oscillators. For our Japanese Schoolgirls pluck, choose a saw and a square, and tune the saw wave one octave higher than the square.

1. Now complete the basic pluck sound by setting up your LP filter and its envelope. [^[In ^Sylenth1]](http://i.imgur.com/G7w2g.png) [^[In ^Massive]](http://i.imgur.com/uSyoP.png)

2. Next stop is your unison controls. In terms of detuning, this pluck is pretty *al dente* and only has just enough unison to get dat thickness. If you can, turn off oscillator retriggering (this is a necessary step in Sylenth1). When unison oscillators are retriggered, [they get synced up again](http://imgur.com/JI7U1), which reduces the thickness of the sound. This is where Oatmeal falls short, by the way. Its retriggering can’t be turned off, so the sound is stuck in kind-of-thin mode. Bummer, man. :(

That’s it for a basic pluck. Most of this stuff is just not too fancy.

**Dessert**

You’ve probably already gone crazy with automating the filter frequency and decay speed, but in case you haven’t: these parameters are the magic of this sound.

This specific sound was made of one square and one saw an octave higher, but obviously that’s not your only option. The type and tuning of the oscillators dictates the timbre of the pluck, and a wide variety of sounds can be obtained by changing saws to squares to crazy Massive wavetables and raising and lowering their octaves. For extra credit today, turn this pluck into a thick and deep bass.

Feel like breaking the rules? Change up the pluck envelope. Twist the attack knob and get the wubby ""pluck"" from one of my favorite tracks, [""Abandoned"" by Proff](http://youtu.be/bwNCTvRwOQg).

Why don't we, every month, all record ONE sample (If you have a high quality microphone) or even make a patch for a specific plugin, and at the end of the month we all post our high-quality self-recorded sample on to a post with the original raw wav. AND a processed version which was tweaked by yourself. That way, we can all help each other out as majority of us will be chipping in, AND we can all download each other's samples and increase the size of our libraries for free? I'm sure there could be a smoother way to do this but what do you think? Obviously we can do more than just one sample but I think one will be enough to start off, and then see how it goes, or maybe do this every week?

EDIT:
 
I've had a pretty good idea of how to approach this. I'm assuming most of you are producers right? And I also assume that majority of you have a Soundcloud account. If not I would highly recommend getting one, its literally the music central of electronic music for all producers at the moment! 

Right here is how it could work. We all upload our samples on to our soundcloud profile (in private mode), so maybe its just a one-shot kick drum, guitar pluck, snare drum, vocal etc. This is good because we can then PREVIEW the sound before downloading it. We would enable download on the sample uploaded, and when put in private mode, we can put what soundcloud calls 'secret link' on to the post put up on here! All we have to do is basically comment on the post and say something like:

Kick Drum Sample
Format: wav 24Bit


[Private Link]

So if anyone is after a kick drum, they can then check it out, and if they like it, they can download it from their soundcloud! AND, what's even better is we can check out everyone's work too and maybe follow each other and show some support! :D We should keep the sound up for probably a week and then delete it, so everyone has a week to download everyone's samples which should be enough, and it stops our soundcloud from getting cluttered with samples.

For people who will be making patches, they can simply just upload the file to a file-sharing site like 'Zippyshare' 'Mediafire' 'Sendspace' etc, and write something like:

Type: Patch
DAW: Reason
Plugin: Massive
Style: Plucky Bass/Pad/Lead Synth etc.... and then post on the same comment the download link which they too will keep up for roughly a week.

Sound cool?

",JDPatFig,175,17,90,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1at4aa/the_myth_of_that_particular_synth_discussion/,"Hey, all.  I feel like waxing philosophical about synthesis, and the topic is this:  It is a myth that you need to know what synthesizer was used to create a sound in order to reverse engineer that sound.  And, worse yet, restricting yourself to the same synth could just cause problems. 

I am a synth programmer that almost exclusively does reverse engineering of sounds used on well-known tracks.  When I see a discussion about a particular sound veer off into the specific type of synth that was used, I get sweaty, because in most instances, that information provides very little help.  

There are a few reasons why I believe this.  The first is that most sounds you hear on fully produced tracks are not the result of a single synth or a single track.  They consist of multiple tracks, perhaps panned and EQ'd differently, perhaps layered, perhaps with some tracks playing some notes and other tracks playing others to form a seamless sound.  

The best way to approach reverse engineering is to stop thinking about synths and start thinking about sound.  Jump sounds like Jump not because it was played on an Oberheim OB-X, but because it consists of saw tooth waves with Oberheim's classic artifacts, phasing, random oscillator wave start points, and, if I remember right, a very light pitch envelope on the attack.  It also is panned left on the CD with wet reverb in the right channel, possibly the result of two tracks used without the benefit of quantizing. 

How do you recreate that sound if you can't spend $10,000 on an Oberheim?  

Saw waves, of course.  But what do you do if you combine a bunch of saws and they simply aren't beefy enough?  Add EQ?  That won't work, because EQ just boosts the frequencies that are there already - EQs do not ADD frequencies.  

Layering some outside-the-box type of waves is something everyone should try when reverse engineering sounds.  A damn organ sample through a LPF might beef up a patch perfectly without anyone being able to tell it's an organ.

Adding randomness to the amount of detuning might add the slight phasing.  

The point is this:  synth programming is about how things sound, not about learning what equipment was used.  Learning to solve the problem with the sound is something to work on and it has very little to do with solving the riddle of what synth was used. 

What do you all think?  Do you have approaches to reverse engineering sounds? ",,False,,t5_2sa4x,False,,,True,t3_1at4aa,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1at4aa/the_myth_of_that_particular_synth_discussion/,

edit: link to AMA http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/12r4q3/wolfgang_gartner_ama/

edit #2: trying to compile some of the production related (for the most part) answers. sorry the formatting sucks i did it quickly - 

**Q:** I know you have a major synth collection, so I was wondering what your favorite and/or most prized one is.

**A:** Dave Smith Poly Evolver

**Q:** Is there any life lesson you would like to share with us?

**A:** never stop doing what you love. you could get locked up for 10 years and come out and still be successful at it if you love it enough and are good at it. (i didn't get locked up for 10 years just saying).

**Q:** Dat lead synth in the intro of ""The Way It Was"". How?

**A:** secret family recipe. ;) i won't tell you the synth, and it doesn't really matter - just LOTS of very mild pitch automation on the lead. set the pitch bend to +1 / -1 and do quick little automations on certain notes. I play this all live and automate it live and tune it up in the DAW. It's basically just how Herbie Hancock or Chick Corea or Ohio Players did those ""worm"" leads, I've been doing it for years but I really took it a step further on that. Lots of really quick, minor pitch bends in just the right places.

**Q:** How involved are you in the lighting and video production of your shows?

**A:** not at all. I already spend 100% of my time focusing on the music part. I don't have time to get involved with that stuff or it will take away from the music. I leave it to the guys who do that stuff best. Just do what you do best and let everybody else handle the rest. Hey that rhymed. 

**Q:** How to stand out from the crowd of EDM producers? How does one come about to achieve a unique sound that they can call their own?

**A:** that's the ultimate goal and the hardest thing for any artist to do. and i think every artist is in a constant battle with standing out and being unique. i don't have a definitive answer for this one, just that it's one of the biggest challenges.

**Q:** Percussion loops in original productions - yay or nay?

**A:** it's not black and white. i usually only use loops that i've pre-made myself and only in the background to fill up space. but people do great things with a loop off a sample cd sometimes. there are no rules. i stopped having any moral opinion on the subject a while back. i just do my own thing which is start from scratch.

**Q:** Hi Wolfgang! huge fan! What is your favourite native instrument software?
I've recently purchased Komplete and am loving Massive and FM8!

**A:** guitar rig. 

**Q:** What inspired you to pursue electronic music? What sort of musical background do you have?

**A:** about 10 years of classical piano training is the background. what inspired me? hearing the music for the first time.
 
**Q:** Was there a time in your career you were ready to quit and give up? If you were to quit then, where would you be now? Besides your fans, what keeps you going? I am producer and have been for a few years, what advice can you offer to keep going cause I feel like giving up time to time? Thank you for taking the time and have a good day.

**A:** there were probably a hundred times where i was ready to quit pursuing it as a career, and many times where i did quit pursuing it as a career for a while. but i always did it for fun in my spare time. and it doesn't take much extra effort to post it on soundcloud after you made it right? so really if you're doing it for fun, it doesn't matter. then the chance is always there that it will become something more. for me it was just a matter of when i was mailing out demos and when i was too lazy or unmotivated to mail out demos. one time the demo got signed and here i am.

**Q:** What elements do you think are most important to take a mix/live set to the next level from just track A beatmatched with track B?
Specific Fx (freeze delay being very popular), Samples, Layering (live mashup), tension-release in tracklisting, ect.

**A:** I think it's a really abstract concept and it can't be answered with a simple answer. A set should be an experience. You shouldn't just be thinking about A and B but think about A and Z. Also, I use CDJ's, you mention Ableton effects and I don't know how to use a computer to DJ so I can't answer those specifically.

**Q:** What advice do you have for kids who want to start doing what you're doing? Where's a good place to start? Where do you get your inspiration from?

**A:** a computer and some plugins these days.
inspiration is more valuable than gold. if i could buy it i would be blowing the bank. i have no idea where it comes from.

**Q:** What would you say the most important thing in getting your music out there is? What kinds of marketing, social networking, etc. I REALLY hope that I get to see one of your sets someday.. You're a boss!

**A:** this is one of the most common questions i get. and i answer it the same way almost every time - stop thinking about how to get your music out there and just focus on making it better. there are A&amp;R's who go LOOKING FOR YOU (like mine for Kindergarten), if your music is that good, they will find out, even if you just throw it up on soundcloud. stop thinking about marketing and just think about music. We take the old school approach to A&amp;R'ing and go out into the world and find it, rather than waiting for it to come to us, and a lot of other labels do too. That's how you find the gold if you're a good talent scout. Because the demo in your inbox is in 30 other labels' inboxes too. 

**Q:** Would you mind briefly stating your workflow? I know it's different for each track but do you work on a melody first? Drums? 

**A:** drums usually.

**Q:** How do you make that really dissonant high sound in a lot of your tracks? You use it a lot in The Champ. I've tried to reproduce it but I can never even get close, any tips?

**A:** you can do it with anything. just a lot of distortion. it's usually just one note but with the right distortion you can make it sound like real electric guitar feedback if you play the right interval over the bass note that you put it on top of.

Open up a blank project in your favorite DAW and let's get started.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* 1 saw wave
* Distortion (A plain soft clip like Ableton's Saturator or Fruity Soft Clip sounds closest to Jaytech's original)
* Spatialization (i.e. delay and reverb) to taste.

**The Key**

The essence of this sound is a saw wave passed through clipping distortion plus epic spatialization effects.

**Get Cooking**

1. This is a simple chain with only a few elements: generator &gt; distortion &gt; spatialization. Go ahead and get set that up, I'll wait.

2. Get a raw saw wave running out of your synth. That's it, just a pure saw wave, no envelopes or nothin'. Now set your distortion to a simple soft clip and turn it up. At this point you should pretty much have the target sound! Hey, that was easy.

2. Now go back to your synth and turn on a low-pass (LP) filter. It's time to get artsy, so put on your Mozart wig. By slowly and grandiosely sweeping the filter around as you play, you can get the epic ebbs and swells that you hear in ""Pyramid."" Record the sweeps as automation alongside your notes. The notes in Pyramid, by the way, are as follows: A, F# down to A, B, then A down to E, F#.

**Tweaks**

The brief moments when two notes are playing at once create an awesome shredding sound, but if the harshness isn't what you're looking for, I recommend turning the voices down to 1 and enabling portamento/glide, it's pretty sweet.

This is a pretty simple setup, so there's infinite opportunities to expand your performance. One of my favorites is to get funky with the pitch bend. This can create some pretty epic musical phrases as the pitch slowly glides up to reach its peak at the target note.

**Serve With Breakdown Sauce**

Any questions? What sound would you like to hear next time?

Hello, I'm trying something new. In these recipes, I'm going to post step-by-step deconstructions of a specific sound. Hopefully you like, and if so, I'll keep making them! I'm also expecting to get lots of feedback in the comments that reveals where I wasn't clear or what else I should include.

I'm trying to have these first few episodes serve as an intro to sounds for beginners. If this reads like a nursery rhyme to you, well, stay tuned. Of course, I'm starting simple for my own benefit, too, since I'm new to tutorial-making.

Browsing forums and stuff, I picked up some mentalities that I feel like I really shouldn't have. I still have fun making music, I just feel this constant feeling of me not making something good enough or doing something wrong. 

Take for example making a song with only a few tracks. All that runs through my head is that it's too simple, I'm not being ""original"" enough, it needs to be more complex. And I understand how some tracks can be repetitive and need more complexity. But my issue is after a while I lose sight of the reality of how my track sounds vs what I think it should sound like due to all those elitist attitudes. After a while I just get a massive creative block because I get caught up in feeling like everything I do is wrong.

But when you know the sound you're after, knowing how to program your synths to achieve that sound is going to save you time and money.

The responses in the ""Which VST for this sound?"" threads [like this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1fbd86/what_is_a_good_vst_to_get_a_warm_retro_synth/) are mostly just lists of VSTs.  Which is fine, because that's what the OP asked for.

But in these cases where the OP already knows what sound they're going for, doesn't it make more sense to approach the solution in terms of recipes of synth modules and signal processing?

There could be many benefits from using Steam as a music platform.
For starters, free updates will be much easier since the cloud basically takes care of everything when new versions are released. Bug fixes will be available quickly, as well.

Another benefit is the use of the Workshop as a way to share music, plugins, and presets.

I know this kind of gives Fl Studio a bit of that ""toy"" feel, but seriously consider this as being a great idea.

-------------------

**Everything is sine waves.**

Any signal can be converted from a function of intensity over time, to a series (a summation) of sine waves.  This adding up of sine waves will exactly equal the original signal -- this is mathematically proven.  At the core of this is the [Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform), which you usually learn about in your third or fourth semester of calculus in college.  This a bit of a shame, because the Fourier transform is a beautiful application of mathematics.  (Although, it's pretty involved, equations for it look like [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/9/6/d/96d719730559f4399cf1ddc2ba973bbd.png).) 

The Fourier transform has many uses in math, science, physics, electronics, image processing, and digital signal processing.  That last bit is what we do, as any DAW is at its core a DSP.  DAW's do not actually do a full Fourier Transform, but actually a [Discrete Fast Fourier Transform](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fft) (""FFT"") that is actually possible to do with minimal latency, but you do not need to be concerned with this.  All you need to take away from this is the transformation from the ""time domain"" to the ""frequency domain"" --  from a sequence of intensities and times (think raw WAV data) to a group frequencies and phases (just a  bunch of sine waves, stuff we can actually work with).

Why is this important?  Although sound is really just patterns of air pressure entering our ears, we do not perceive the instantaneous deformation of our eardrums.  What we actually perceive are the interactions between multiple frequencies of sound -- we perceive the spectrum of audio.  This has to do with the physics of the [cochlea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochlea), which I won't get into now.  Working in the frequency space of audio is working with audio perceptually.

--------------------------------------------------

What are some properties of sine waves we should know about? 

At it's core, a [sine wave](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave) is an oscillation -- a vibration.  It represents a single frequency.  It's a periodic function -- meaning it repeats endlessly, and each repetition is identical.  Sine functions show up all over the place in mathematics, when you're dealing with triangles or circles, but in audio, it shows up because it is a solution to the [spring equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_equation), but the full explanation is 4th semester calculus.  All you need to know is that vibrating things make sine waves.  You may also have heard of the ""cosine"".  It is defined as the rate of change (or slope) of a sine function, but it is identical to a phase-shifted sine wave.

What happens when you add 2 sine waves that are the same frequency? Well, you get a single sine wave that is twice the amplitude, duh.  But what if one is phase shifted from the other?  Then the amplitude is lowered proportional to how much the waves are out of phase.  [Here's](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+sin%28t%29+%2B+sin%28t%29%2C+plot+sin%28t%29+%2B+sin%28pi%2F2+%2B+t%29%2C+plot+sin%28t%29+%2B+sin%282pi%2F3+%2B+t%29%2C+plot+sin%28t%29+%2B+sin%283pi%2F4+%2B+t%29%2C+plot+sin%28t%29+%2B+sin%28pi+%2B+t%29) a graph of what it looks like as the phase increases.  Also notice once the waves are ""pi radians"" or 180 degrees out of phase, the waves cancel out and you get 0  -- Wolfram even makes that optimization in the graph.  This effect is known as ""phase cancellation"".

What about when you add 2 sine waves that are almost the same frequency?  You then get an effect known as ""beating"".  What you get is a single wave that is the average of the 2 frequencies, modulated by another wave that is the half the difference of the 2 frequencies.  If you add a 50 Hz wave and a 60 Hz wave, you will get a 55hz wave modulated by a 5 Hz wave.  [Here's a graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot+sin%285t%29+%2B+sin%286t%29%2C+plot+2cos%280.5t%29sin%285.5t%29).  This is important, especially when dealing with bass.  If you play 2 adjacent bass notes, you will hear a bad ""WUBWUBWUB"" sound, and the final pitch won't be either of the pitches you want.  This is generally why you only play one bass note at a time.  In higher frequencies, the effect is less apparent.  This can actually add a nice effect -- chorus/unison plugins work by combining the original signal with slightly detuned versions, and all the various beat frequencies make everything sound more organic.

-----------------------------------

What is a [harmonic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic)?  When something vibrates, say a plucked string, or a column of air in a tube, it produces a wave that is inversely proportional to the length of the object.  This is the fundamental frequency.  However, it will also produce one that is half the length, and 1/3rd the length, and 1/4th the length, ... etc.  These are the *harmonics*.  How the object emphasizes these harmonics ajdusts the ""timbre"" of the object.

Since frequency is inversely proportional to length, a harmonic is just a sine wave that whose frequency is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.  So if you have a fundamental frequency of 100 Hz, your harmonics will be sine waves at 200 Hz, 300 Hz, 400 Hz, 500 Hz, ... *n*\*100 Hz, ... etc..  Added up, these waves will produce a coherent note  (again, this gets into how your cochlea works and how we perceive sound).  Any other frequencies, say at 250 Hz, will sound like they are from a different note.  Signals with lots of harmonics, or emphasized harmonics, will sound ""brighter"" or ""sharper"", whereas signals with fewer harmonics, or de-emphasized harmonics will sound ""warmer"" or ""duller"", until they regress to a pure sine wave again -- the fundamental frequency.

------------------------------------

What do the harmonics look like for some common waveforms?  A pure saw wave is a wave that has every single harmonic at equal energy.  (Since energy is proportional to the frequency, the amplitude falls off exponentially, to make the sound energy of each harmonic  equal).  A Saw wave at the note A4 (440 Hz) equals 1\*sin(440t) + 1/2\*sin(880t) + 1/3\*sin(1320t) + 1/4\*sin(1760t) + 1\5\*sin(2200t) + ... + 1/*n*\*sin(440 *n* t) + .... until you exceed the audible range of human hearing (~20000Hz).  Don't believe me? [Check this out](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+sin%28nt%29%2Fn%2C+n+from+1+to+400%2C+plot+t+from+-10+to+10).  A square wave is similar, except every other harmonic is skipped.  [Graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+sin%28%282n-1%29\*t%29%2F%282n-1%29%2C+n+from+1+to+400%2C+plot+t+from+-10+to+10). Triangle waves are similar to square waves spectrally, except the energy of each harmonic falls off exponentially.  [Graph](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sum+%28sin%28%282n-1%29t%29%2F%28%282n-1%29^2%29%29+\*+%28-1%29^%28n-1%29%2C+n+from+1+to+400%2C+plot+t+from+-10+to+10).   These three common wave-forms are actually very closely related.  But it also shows how variations in the patterns of the harmonics adjust the timbre.  Noise is all frequencies added together -- no harmonics,  random phase. 

Graphing all these shapes by adding sine waves is essentially taking the inverse Fourier Transform -- so we can see how you can easily convert from the time domain to the frequency domain, and back.  So why do we work with waveforms like triangles and saws and squares?  Why not just work directly with the harmonics, adding up sine waves?  Actually, that is the basis of [Additive Synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Synthesis_sawtooth.gif) -- it's how Harmor works.  Subtractive Synthesizers that work with waveforms are really just emulating the analog era -- saws, squares, and triangles are easy for hardware signal generators to make.

You may have noticed that the saw and square graphs had some ""fuzziness"" at the ""corners"" of the waveforms.  That's because there is a limit to what Wolfram Alpha can actually graph.  If it could graph the infinite series, it would have perfect edges.  The takeway here is that you need really high frequencies to create ""corners"" in your waveforms.  It takes a lot of energy to instantaneously move your speaker cone in the opposite direction, therefore you need a high frequency sound wave.  This is why clipping in your signal creates a really harsh sound, and you need to ""de-click"" certain samples.  It's also why distortion adds harmonics.  There are a million methods to distort a signal, from bitcrushing, to clipping , to doing physical simulation of vacuum tubes.  The reason some guitar players kill for a tube amp is because vacuum tubes stop amplifying linearly as they reach their limit -- they very softly clip the signal, not really adding/boosting those high frequency harmonics much, giving a nice ""warm"" distortion sound.  Meanwhile, power metal bands use transistor amps, which clip the signal much more harshly, for an entirely different effect.  Digital amps clip perfectly, for an effect no one wants. :P

----------------------------------------

How do EQ's and filters work in light of this?  EQ's lower the amplitudes of the sine waves in certain frequency bands.  Most EQ's actually work by phase cancellation -- they mix the signal with itself, but gradually shift the phase of certain frequency bands so the waves begin cancelling out.  Phase shift 180 degrees, and it cancels out completely.  (It's worth noting that most digital EQs and filters don't work using FFT, but with other mathematical techniques).  Filters just cut out certain frequency bands above or below the cutoff -- there will be a transitional band around the cutoff frequency as the amplitudes fall off.  The steepness of this fall-off is sometumes called the ""order"" or ""Q"" of the filter.

Thinking about the frequency domain also makes EQing in the mixing process make more sense.  You want to isolate the frequency bands of each element -- too many frequencies, too much stuff in one band, and your mix starts sounding like noise, or you get weird phase cancellation effects.  Your brain can't process those frequencies properly and figure out what's going on.  So if two things have overlapping frequency ranges and are making your mix messy, you either need to EQ to isolate, use sidechain compression to make one dominant over the other, or not have them play at the same time.

There has been a lot of discussion about originality in the EDM scene. There are two reasons this field lacks originality: 1) there's little pressure from the audience to be creative — they just want to dance, they don't care if it sounds almost the same as the last track they heard, and 2) the barrier to entry into this genre is so low.

So I see lots of new producers producing within a particular genre. Everyone does it, and it's good practice in the beginning to emulate things you like (I have been doing a lot of [Todd Edwards-esque microsampling](https://soundcloud.com/capyac/keep-your-best-friend-close) recently). BUT in this scene, people _really_ want to have their minds blown. They want to hear a _new_ genre. Even if they'll dance to decent, okay, alright stuff that doesn't sound ""new"" at all (except in a faddish way), they'll _really_ freak-out when something crazy comes on the speakers. That's our goal.

**So this is just a reminder (and really just my opinion): the best way to get known in this scene is to make something no one has ever heard before. Let's strive for that, guys.**

Personally I have interest in the electro-pop sounds (like the Katy Perry, Marina and the Diamonds, Kesha, Ellie Goulding, Lady Gaga styles).

1355745988.0,130,self.edmproduction,14znuc,Very simple mixdown tip which will make a huge difference to how tight/punchy/loud your mix sounds!,,151,21,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/14znuc/very_simple_mixdown_tip_which_will_make_a_huge/,"Firstly I'd just like to give credit to the producer 'Culprate' for this little tip which he shared in an interview I read online and I'm sure many of you who are aware of him and his music will too be very aware of the quality of his work.

Tip: Put a low pass filter on the master bus when mixing, have it roll off around 90Hz so you can hear the real thumpy part of the sub bass and kick, whilst mixing the drums + bass, constantly keep bypassing this filter just to make sure everything is sounding tight and punchy down there and to see if any other sounds within your track need high-passing as some frequencies can cheekily creep up down there. If it sounds very soft and muddy you'll have a very breathy sounding track with no character (unless that's what you want), but ensuring that the kick and bass are sitting incredibly well together is crucial for a punchy tight sounding mix, just keep referring back to it when applying compression/eq/harmonic exciting etc, trust me it'll work wonders, as its very hard to hear if the kick and bass are working in harmony when you have all of the frequencies above smashing down your ears, which as we all know our ears are more sensitive to. If things sound a bit muddy, never finish with 'that'll do', because it won't, be patient and don't rush this part, just spend all the time you need, get it sorted and then bring up the volume of the rest of the song which are higher up the spectrum.

Edit: Sometimes just changing the kick sample is all you need! Don't always feel the need to stick with what you originally started with, changing samples/laying samples can work wonders and save hours of time, you just have to be open minded and willing to make big changes if it means it will get things to work because remember, the people who will be listening to the track will have no idea how it SHOULD have sounded, only you know that, they will just receive it and be blown away with the great mix you did :). 

If you do this, not only will your track stand out more, you should be able to get at least another db or two when mastering because if your track originally had clashing frequencies from the sub bass and kick, there will be some frequencies from both sounds which will be the same, and when more than one of the same frequency is played together in the software it makes it louder, and the bass is one of the first things to distort when pushing the crap out of the limiter, so having a clean low end will stop this frequency over-lapping meaning there's more headroom to boost it on the master, if the track is aimed to be played either on the radio or in clubs of course where loudness unfortunately is desirable and sometimes needed. 

Edit: Just want to add that Noisia, 'the producer's producers', usually spend 6-12 months PER SONG. They obviously have a lot going on at once, and don't sit working on one song for the whole year, but remember that there's three very knowledgeable producers in a stupidly accurate studio(s) but that doesn't give them any excuse to make track after track, they still with all the tools and knowledge of music theory take their time so you should too. What I'm getting at is...CHILL. Don't think churning out track after track is going to get you noticed, obviously you will get that one incredible track out of every 20-30 but you're much better off just staying chilled, being patient and getting a song sounding as best as you can with the tools and knowledge you currently have. Noisia don't have some of the best sounding tracks for no reason, they're patient and simply enjoy sound designing, I use to rush my productions, I've now slowed down loads and all the tracks I've been working on are sounding almost professional which I can't wait to put out, it just means your chances of getting noticed by the (right) people will increase if you have quality work so spend as long as you can getting the bass and kick to work! Quality &gt; Quantity. 


Hope this helps! :)

Right, lets go again, this time, compression. 

Just to clear things up, this is for people who are very intrigued by the term, but have never felt the need to go in to it but if you're someone who produces heavy music, then compression will be your favorite tool. In this I'll be explaining why its used, not how it is used as there's many great tutorials out there on Youtube to show you but this is SO important to know to use what you learn in those tutorials efficiently! 



Lets Go! 

Most tutorials I see online are very good, they explain how its used and why it originally came about, but they don't actually explain WHY you would use it, and HOW it makes your stuff louder.

A compressor is simply an automatic volume knob. It keeps things under control. You know that incredibly loud family member or friend you have? How nice would it be to just have a volume knob for them and just turn them down so they're the same volume as everyone else, would be a dream wouldn't it? Well the compressor is simply this however, what's even more gorgeous about the compressor is it will do the work for you. Rather than you constantly having to adjust the volume of that person's voice, the compressor will do it.

So what we have found out is a compressor turns things DOWN. 

So ChewyMagnets, how the fuck can a compressor make things louder if it constantly turns thing down you idiot? 

Let me tell you.

Imagine you're in a club which is stupidly loud and its giving you a headache. You have that friend next you who's trying to talk but all you do is nod your head and just say 'yes' constantly and do fake laughs because you have no fucking idea what they're saying and just hoping you don't make a twat out of yourself. Lets say you have that volume knob again for the person. If you turn that person up so you can hear them, on top of the loud music and other slobbery hormonal teenagers around you, things will be even MORE LOUDER, making it even more unbearable. But imagine if you had a volume knob so you could turn everything else down, apart from your friend, that way you can hear your friend without having a huge headache! Suddenly the vibe of the club has gone, the music is as quiet as your nan's telly so you want the music up but you can't because then you can't hear your friend again. So instead of turning up the music, why don't you keep everything as it is now (level), and turn ALL of it up. That way, you can hear the music loud and punchy which maintains the club's vibe, *and* you can now hear your friend as everything else was brought down earlier level with their voice!

This is how a compressor works, it simply turns down things which are too loud to make it level with the quieter stuff, and then you bring up the WHOLE leveled volume back up to its original volume, but this time the quieter stuff can now be heard as well as, what was previously the loud stuff. 

Here comes the technical shit, but don't run away now, you were doing so well! 

I'm now going to explain how compressors make your songs/sounds 'appear' louder. 

Right, we make music for the human ear don't we? So now its important to know how the human ear works.

The human ear is designed to hear frequencies in which we can produce with our voice which makes sense as what's the point in making ears for communication if you can't hear someone else? 

The average voice is around 100Hz - 4000Hz (probably wrong but its within that anyway). Our ears however can hear from around 20Hz (very low) all the way up to 20,000Hz (very high) however, our ears are most sensitive around the region in which the human voice sits in which is understandable right? Too simplify, we can hear subtle changes in audio around 100Hz - 4000Hz much more efficiently than we would around 17,000 Hz - 20,000Hz.

Another important thing to know about the human ear is it isn't perfect. If you have a snare drum that hits at 0db (as loud as it could possibly go) however its a really quick snappy snare that lasts around 50ms, and you have the same snare but this time it hits a little lower in volume (around -4db) however its duration is longer (about 200ms), its most likely the the snare with the longer duration (although technically quieter) will sound louder. To the computer the snappy snare which hits at 0db will be louder, but to the human ear (which is what we design our music to be heard by) the quieter yet longer snare will appear louder. The reason for this is because the human ear interestingly confuses loudness with long average volume.

*The higher the average volume of any audio, the louder it will appear*.

This is crucial to know. 

Ever wonder why your track that hits at 0db, compared to a track from Skrillex which also hits at 0db is so much quieter? Its because the little shaven dude has used this fact about the human ear to his advantage to make his stuff APPEAR loud, even though technically its just as loud as your track. 

Getting bored? So am I but fight through it, this is important stuff to know.

Right, lets go back to my first little story about you being in a club. You have the really loud music which is pretty much over-lapping everything, and you have all the voices which you most probably cannot even hear because the music is too loud. When you turned down the volume of everything else apart from your friend's voice so its as loud as his voice, and then turned up EVERYTHING afterwards, including his voice, you actually just made things more uncomfortable for yourself. Because not only are the loud things loud (the music), your friends voice and most probably everyone else's voices are at the same level as the music. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU

YOU IDIOT, YOU'VE JUST MADE THE AVERAGE VOLUME OF THE CLUB EVEN LOUDER AS THE LITTLE SPACES OF SILENCE WITHIN THE CLUB'S MUSIC IS NOW BEING FILLED UP BY THE VOICES OF HORNY TEENAGERS CHATTING EACH OTHER UP!!!!!!!

This is shit however this is actually what you're after in your music to make things loud.

Usually the things that are the loudest in your song (the things that make the volume fader go up and down more than Kim Kardashin) are usually the drums, as they normally have quite a lot of low energy and are very punchy transient-heavy sounds that are usually prioritized within electronic music as they are the backbone of most tracks. So the reason why you CONSTANTLY hear people say to use compression to make tracks louder is because of the club scene example I just wrote. You will use a compressor to quieten down the loudness of the drums so they're nearer the volume of the rest of the music (vocals, synths, guitars etc), and the extra headroom you've saved from turning them down you can now use to push the WHOLE THING UP. So now, the quieter sounds in your song have just been increased by the headroom you've saved by pushing down the peaks of the drums. 

Imagine you compressed the kick drum by 2db and the kick was originally hitting at 0db, so now its hitting at -2db, and the 'body' of your track which is where all the vocals and shit are were originally sitting comfortably at -10db (on average), when you now turn all of it up, the 'body' will now be sitting at -8db (louder) and the kicks will be hitting back at 0db again. Now your track will appear louder as you've just increased the average volume of the track, as its the 'body' of the track where the loudness actually is, because do you remember me saying human ears percieve long sounds as loud? Well all your long swooping/clashing sounds will be in the body and you've just lifted that up by 2db! 

The only down-side to this is you've just crushed the kick drum by 2db, so this will without a doubt change the sound of the kick, hopefully not enough to cause major distortion and yucky sounds but 2db should be fine in most cases but its best to experiment and USE YOUR EARS. This is why quieter music sounds better, because nothing has been crushed, or at least it has been crushed a lot less vigorously. 


So that's it, that's WHY compression is useful and HOW it actually works to make things loud, now all you have to do is learn how to use one. If you want me to write another long-winded thing like this on that, let me know but considering how well my last post went, I'd be happy to help everyone out because you've helped me a tonne! 

Thank you, please correct me if I'm wrong anywhere or if I've missed things out, I'll change it asap and credit you. Hope this helps out guys!

After I did the mixing and mastering a track from start to finish I set out to make a free course to compete with the major schools. I plan to go over everything in layman's terms at first then get into more and more technical and practical personal theory and do full on mixdowns and master tracks. 

Im almost completed the usual tools and suspects of the mixdown and gave some brief examples of solving frequency conflict but ill be getting into mixing multiple sources and what to listen to ect. The video series is planned to be at least 50 hours.

Now I am interested to hear what you would want me to go over, if you have a track you woulnt mind me mixing and critically looking at for a video and if you would think a recorded skypecall or google hangout to shoot the shit would be an idea you would be up for.

I dont claim to be an expert but I hope to help people along and give back much like people like Andivax helped me.

So far I have this tip to share: Don't be afraid to get inspiration to your songs from somewhere. Not only will it be easier to progress about making a song (because you have an idea for how your song will sound), but you are also very likely to not be able to copy it 100%, and change things you personally want in the progress, and you end up with something original/not recognizable.

I decided not to make a video since there were so many requests to do just text tutorials but down the road I will probably have text/video/audio tutorials especially for things like envelopes where seeing the shape and length is crucial to the sound.


I am intentionally keeping everything very basic and fundamental; this guide is designed so that anyone reading can apply the techniques to any FM synth so as a result I won't be going over anything too advanced (yet) and I'll only explain certain parts in detail when necessary.


If you're familiar with FM synthesis basics (what an operator/modulator/carrier is, what it is exactly etc.) then skip down to the next part.

So what exactly is Frequency Modulation Synthesis? It is defined as the change of timbre of a waveform by modulating that waveform with the frequency of another waveform. What does this mean exactly? Well I assume you know what an LFO is and I also assume you know what it sounds like. That's basically what FM synthesis is (you can actually make LFOs with oscillators in FM synths) except instead of using only Low Frequencies you're using much faster frequencies so the timbre is changed instead of just the parameters of a filter or volume control.


In FM there are 2 oscillators (sound generators) called a carrier and a modulator. A carrier carries the sound; it's just a basic oscillator that generates a waveform. A modulator is the oscillator which modulates the carrier. In certain FM synths however you have operators (Abletons operator, FM8) because an oscillator can be a carrier, a modulator, or both. I personally use FM8 so I apologize in advance if I'm not being as ""synth agnostic"" as possible but I will try to keep it so.

For those of you who are more visually inclined here a couple of examples. In [this](http://imgur.com/6W4YAkk) picture operator F is the carrier and operator E is the modulator. In [this](http://imgur.com/tcq1Ngu) picture operator F is a carrier and operator is E is a modulator *and* a carrier.

 Now that you're familiar with what FM is let's talk about how it works...

___________________________________________________________


If you take a look at [this](http://imgur.com/9EbrynJ) picture you will see a summarized view of the operators on the left and on the left you will see the FM Matrix. The FM matrix is where you'll be spending the most time as that is where you are ""FMing"" the operators.


I think the part most people have trouble with in FM is the ratios. I've seen people talk about only being able to make whale sounds, or lasers, or bells so that's what I'll be focusing on.

Basically a ratio is pitch. The higher the frequency, the higher pitch, the lower the frequency the lower the pitch. The thing is, because of bessel functions, these ratios are linear. There's a certain amount of unpredictability in FM but with *harmonic* ratios you can learn what to expect.

If you take operator F and bring its ratio to 2 you will hear that it moves UP an octave because you doubled its frequency linearly. If you halve the ratio (.5) you will hear that it moves DOWN an octave because you halved its frequency. To keep going up by octaves you have to double the previous frequency to acheive the next octave so the next octave would be at 4, then 8, then 16 and so on. To lower the frequency you just keep halving the previous frequency so .5, .25, .125 and so on. Since these ratios are harmonic to the original frequency (1) you can use any of these safely to create a harmonic sound. 

Knowing what to use when you want a certain sound has a lot to do with just straight experimentation, especially by changing the waveform or putting things through the filter before you use it as a modulator. The harmonic ratios just make it easier to determine what kind of sound will come out of different matrix configurations.

One thing I've tried but I'm not sure if it actually has any different effect (anyone with more knowledge could chime in) is starting with a ratio of .75 and then basing everything else off of that frequency but I usually just stick to 1.


As you can guess using lower ratios in the modulators is better for bassy sounds whereas higher sounds are good for plucks, chimes, ""metallic noises"" though those usually need envelope tweaking to be truly effective. I'll cover envelopes in another tutorial because envelopes are where things get tricky but very interesting.


Let's turn on another operator and turn it's ratio to .5. Frequency Modulate operator F with operator E. You will hear its sound deepen or kind of sound like it's ""opening up"" because you're adding lower frequencies to a higher ratio so they're kinda meeting in the middle. If you try the opposite, modulating E by F you will hear the metallic sounds I was talking about as you increase the amount of modulation. As you slowly start to modulate other operators you will be able to hear the difference the amount of modulation makes in changing the
 sound. 

A lot can be done with just 2 operators with sin waves that have different ratios. Try turning on ALL operators and have ratios ranging from 4 to .125. Those ratios would be: 4, 2, 1, .5, .25, and .125.). Then just slowly start FMing different operators. One thing that took me a while to grasp is that the amplitude of modulation doesn't always have to be in high amounts. Sometimes I will only use amps of 25-35 just for making something stick out more by adding harmonics. This is especially useful if you run an operator through the filter and then have that operator modulate a sin wave with a low ratio.

The last point I want to talk about is using multiple modulators to effect a single carrier. This is where the post might get a little plugin ""unagnostic"" but the techniques are still applicable. In FM8 if you take an operator and turn it to a 10th formant with a ratio of .5 and have it FM an operator turned to a saw wave also tuned to a ratio of .5 and have the saw wave as the carrier you can create a nice Zedd style chainsaw bass. Then to add some meat back into the sound have an operator turned to a sin with a ratio of .5 and make it a carrier as well. Then FM the sin wave operator by the saw wave operator (which is being modulated by the 10th formant operator) just a touch to introduce the same kind of harmonics to the sin wave to give it some cohesion. The sound might be a little ""clicky"" or harsh but a lot of this has to do with the envelope and that is a separate tutorial in its own. Feel free to experiment with the envelopes and always remember to RTFM!

So that concludes this tutorial. If this stuff seemed a little too bland or easy it may because because using proper ratios is crucial to making harmonic sounds (i.e whale sounds, lazers, beeps and bloops) so I had to lay the groundwork for other tutorials. Please let me know in the comments any suggestions, what you did or didn't like, and what you want to see in the next tutorial.

[LEVEL: BEGINNER] (FL Studio),Yodamanjaro,128,11,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/v817q/a_simple_lesson_in_creating_basslines_level/,"So I've been helping a couple of Redditors here and there, providing screenshots/mp3s of my work for examples to help them along. And I keep asking myself if I should start making posts about these things. ""Maybe some other Redditors out there could use my advice,"" I tell myself. So, here it is. For the first lesson, I keep it basic but it's important to anyone who's just starting off producing. 

**Bassline Lesson - Level: Beginner**

First off: Assuming you just bought FL Studio with just their standard set of VSTs, they're decent to start off with but I haven't heard anything that will make me think they're worth investing your time in. So, I fully recommend you get V-Station. It's great for trance, I use it for most of my basses and that VST was the first one I learned what knob did what.

Now, onto what notes you should play. The bassline in any particular genre should play the root of the chord. Assuming you know basic music theory, this will change as much as your chords change in their progression. Now you can implement it playing 5ths or octaves (which is what I do in my example, octaves anyway). What makes up for the lack of playable notes is the rhythm you can use and the complexity of your bass. This includes any effects you put behind the bass. I'm going to get into that as well.

Here's my chord structure (this is one of my pad instruments): [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/yCbIU.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?q5qdjj5augvlnm5)

Now this is what my bassline plays: [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/4S64Q.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?yqarr24gcsuoq2h)

****

So we have the notes. It still sounds like crap. **It will.** The rest of the work you'll be putting into this is the actual synth sound and the effects it has. Having a good one without the other will make it sound like crap and it will then ruin your song. Many producers will agree with me that once you get your bassline and kick down, you've got your foundation to any EDM genre.

Since I mentioned V-Station, this bassline is using it. I'm sure you're capable of using Google (and Wikipedia) for a ""what is"" sort of thing. Oscillators make the sound type and the rest of those knobs are affecting the sound that's stemming from that (in layman's terms). You can detune anything and everything, make it filtered or add distortion. **Play around with all of the knobs to see what sounds good. It may sound like terrible advice, but that's how you'll learn. Plain and simple.** And once you learn how to use one VST, learning another is a piece of cake. Use presets as a guide as to how you should start to make a certain kind of sound but if that's hurting your exploration then you should ditch presets altogether. Nothing will be more satisfying than using sounds you've created from scratch and for it all to *sound good in the end*.

Now we're onto effects. In my recent projects I use the Param EQ2 and ""The Glue."" The Glue is a great compressor that's used by many professional producers. I suggest you pick that up as well. [Picture of my FX](http://i.imgur.com/mtyJr.jpg)

The other effect I'm using is another Param EQ2, which cuts off the mids and treble of the bass sound to give it a ""clean"" sound. I've highlighted where you can do this in the mixer: [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/kHPB7.png)

What am I doing with it and how do you use it? Right click on that knob I pointed out (next to the green light). Select the ""Create an Automation Clip"" option. Now you can see it in your playlist and then you can right click in there to create ""dots"" and move them around to whatever you'd like. [You can see here](http://i.imgur.com/eZNOH.png) I have the effect all the way off and then slowly introduce it into the song. [Here's the mp3 for your listening pleasure.](http://www.mediafire.com/?3urldpni42cp9fh)

[Here's the bassline after all of the fun stuff added.](http://www.mediafire.com/?gts793oi738mjvb)

****

Now that we're done with that effect, I should mention to you that there's many different ways to accomplish the same thing usually. I used the EQ effect instead of a highpass filter. But I remember when I first started producing and didn't really touch filters until months in so I hope this keeps it simple for you. 

****

In case you're wondering where I've come from and who I am, I've produced for almost 5 years now and have been signed to 5 different labels since producing (signed to one just 6 months in; don't get the wrong idea, that label sucked). I mainly produce trance and downbeat/ambient tracks but I've dabbled in most EDM genres.

I don't normally post anything to this subreddit, because if I have a question it *usually* has been answered already. But this post is just telling you all a big thank you, so here goes...

I've always wanted to make edm, so I started March of this year. I began with FL Studio and thought, ""Man, this shit is tougher than it sounds!!"" But very short after I discovered a subreddit (r/edmproduction) which at first was confusing, what with all the terminology and utilization of DAW's, plug-ins, interfaces, etc. Now I know all the terms, run Ableton Suite as my DAW, purchased upgrade after upgrade, and learned **A LOT**.

Even when I'm in a rut and become depressed, discouraged and distraught that I'm going nowhere with making dance music, this subreddit has given me inspiration in my saddest hours. I mean, hearing from ~~Porter Robinson~~ Wolfgang Gartner himself that he's wanted to quit hundreds of times (and actually did before his success) was a HUGE eye-opener in this pursuit of edm accomplishment.

Not only that, but the direct feedback I have been given on some of my tracks is spot on. It has 100% helped me become a better producer. Hell, even my roommates tell me every time I finish a new track it was better than the last, so I know I'm going in the right direction with all your guys' (and girls'??) help.

My goal someday is to make a career out of making electronic dance music. It's a true passion of mine that I've always wanted to pursue, but never got serious enough until this year. I know this subreddit will continue serving as a great resource in my journey to dance music success. But if not, it will be a great hobby of mine for the time being, because I love doing it.

And to the mods of this subreddit, thank you for all the hard work you put into r/edmproduction. I just wanted to let you all know you're highly appreciated (even if you already know it!) I will provide whatever input I can to make this community more robust and solid.

Thanks all, and Happy Holidays!!

Sincerely,
Aspiring edm producer, just like you

**For Ableton:**

* Use the Utility effect for volume automation instead of automating the main volume knob.  This lets you change the volume of the entire instrument without fussing with the automation points.

* Save all VST instruments in an Instrument Rack and organize them by sound, not by VST type.

* Learn how to utilize 128s (Sampler with 128 samples loaded to scroll through).  This is super helpful when picking the ""right"" kick or snare or whatever.

* Set up effect racks for commonly used effects, and save them as an effect rack.

* Set up a default template so you don't have to waste time setting up effects/tracks/sends/returns that you use frequently.

* Use the spectrum analyzer to visualize the eq on all your tracks.

**General Tips**

* Break your workflow into 2 session types: Daytime and Nighttime sessions.  Daytime sessions are when you have all day to write a song.  Nighttime sessions are for preparing your instruments, effects, drum loops, watching tutorials, organizing your library, etc.  Don't mix up the goals of either session.  I generally have more nighttime sessions than daytime sessions, but when I sit down to write a track, I have a library of instruments, loops, etc to play with and it makes the songwriting much more effective.

* Set 5 minute limits to decide whether a particular instrument works in your track.  Don't waste time trying to make something work if it doesn't work naturally.

* Learn eq theory, and cut generously, boost sparingly.

* Don't hesitate, it stifles your creativity.

* FINISH SONGS.  Even if they will suck, finishing the process until you have a finished song will make you practice everything that a song needs.  You may not be the best at mastering, or at creating drums, etc, but you will slowly get better and being focused on creating a finished product will force you to practice the aspects that need improvement.

* Show respect to everyone you learn from.  Thanks to ill.Gates, Vespers, Tom Cosm, Mr. Bill, Dubspot, Sonic Academy, Tornado Twins, ableton tutorials, and everyone putting out quality content that teaches people to create.",,False,,t5_2sa4x,False,,sc,True,t3_11wj83,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/11wj83/production_protips_thread/,

1355259643.0,111,self.edmproduction,14onah,Synth Recipe 7: Dark Reese,mark-henry,120,9,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/14onah/synth_recipe_7_dark_reese/,"Today we’ll be making [the dark reese from “So High” by Shadow Child](http://youtu.be/OAdTtzqASJU?t=1m54s), requested by Kloster. This is a subwoofer-killing bass that singlehandedly holds its own against the percussion for the majority of this track's peak time. Open up your favorite DAW and we’ll get started.

**The Key**

Reese basses are made from a battery of saw waves with an exaggerated detune. This particular reese gets its special deep dark quality from the effects chain that follows.

**Ingredients**

* One reese bass. This is a bunch of saw waves, heavily detuned.

* One vintage tube amp saturator. If you don’t have one yet, I recommend [the BootEQ mkII from VarietyOfSound](http://varietyofsound.wordpress.com/downloads/).

* Two lowpass filters.

**Get Cooking**

1. Get your reese going. Crank up the voices count and put lots of detune on. Things should get greasy and buzzy. Now turn on a low pass filter. When you dial it in right, it should already sound pretty close to Shadow Child’s bass! But there’s an important element still missing

2. Put on the tube amp effect and turn all the low-frequency knobs to the right and turn on all the vintage tube amp bells and whistles. Seriously, don’t be shy. Kid-in-a-candy-store this tube amp effect, because this is what allows the sound to be loud and huge and powerful without the aid of high frequencies.

3. That saturation will have restored a lot of brightness to the sound, so throw another low pass filter on. (It will also be over level, probably, so turn the volume down.) Shadow Child didn’t want an over-the-top reese; he chose to keep things contained and dark and window-rattlingly bassy. An interesting choice that makes the track distinctive.

**Finish Up**

Finally, the pumping nature of the sound comes from a compressor sidechained to the kick. Other touches will be needed to mix the sound in with the rest of the track. Tweak the EQing, the positions of the low-pass filters, and the tube amp controls.

Also, check out how Shadow Child layers a second, higher, sound [at 2:58](http://youtu.be/OAdTtzqASJU?t=2m58s). This is an excellent way to progress the sound. Another (more obvious) way would be to automate the filter cutoffs, making the sound swell brighter or fade away.

**Serves One Soundsystem**

After talking in IRC for awhile we came up with an idea for a brand new competition which I think you'll all enjoy. This competition will be a fun way to get producers to finish songs and to get you guys out of your comfort zones.


  **THE COMPETITION**

  Your task is to complete a song in a predetermined genre of electronic music. The song can be whatever length you choose and you can use any synthesizers, samples, or software you choose. However, instead of assigning already established genres of EDM, you will be required to create a song in an imaginary genre created for the purpose of this competition.You will be given a few basic characteristics of the genre, and from there everything else is up to you. Here are two examples of such genres:

**THESE ARE EXAMPLES. THESE ARE NOT THE GENRES YOU WILL BE MAKING.**
  
  Genre: Flexatone Hardcore BPM: 140-150

  Time Signature: 4/4
  
  Characteristics: Flexatone Hardcore is known for its use of reverse sidechain compression and harsh gliding melodies.
  
  Genre: Neo-Pulver

  BPM: 155

  Time Signature: 3/4, 4/4

  Instrumentation: Heavy sampling of country music, predominantly triangle based synthesis.

  Characteristics: 1/4 time drums, 32nd note arpeggios, droning bass.

  **^^^ THESE ARE EXAMPLES. THESE ARE NOT THE GENRES YOU WILL BE MAKING.^^^**

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**
  
  The competition will run for two weeks. Upload your finished song to soundcloud as a private track and send the secret link in a PM to [me](http://reddit.com/user/Doomsaloto) or [DinosaurHospital](http://reddit.com/user/DinosaurHospital). A voting thread will be posted with the entries. 


 ***THIS WEEK'S GENRE***

  **Name: Nu-Melowfe**

  **BPM: 150 - 165**

  **Time Signature: Commonly 4/4, some in 6/8.**

  **Characteristics: Known for its erratic pitched percussion, melancholy synth leads, and warm fuzzy atmospheres.  Often makes use of samples from folk music.**


  Hope you guys enjoy this! I'd like to see a decent number of submissions, have fun! The submissions for this first round will be due on **Friday, July 20th.**

I usually pick apart all the layers that I hear, and sometimes I only hear like one or two tracks going. Maybe just a kick and a bass line. However, in my own tracks, if I try to put a sequence where it's just a kick and a bass line, it still doesn't sound ""finished"". It sounds like it's missing something compared to the professional track.

I know mixing definitely affects this, and I know I don't mix professionally, but I do think my mixes end up sounding solid. I think another factor is that I don't finish too much tracks, so when I listen to a professional track and hear a part where it's simply just a pluck sound, I know there's going to be more instruments coming up and I know going in that the time count of the track is going to be long, so that might also affect it sounding more ""done"". It could also just be that it's my own track so it never sounds perfect to me.

Basically, this is more of a discussion than a question, but what do professionals do that make their count of instruments and sounds going at once to go father and sound more ""finished"" than if I were to use the same amount?

**EDIT:** I think there's a lot of divergence from my actual question. A lot of answers are simply providing good overall mixing/mastering tips. I'm not asking how to get a professional sound overall. I'm asking how do pros make less tracks sound more finished. The way they mix (for example) that kick and bass track and what they do with it and what they do around it is important, but its not the way the entire song is mixed/mastered. Its kind of similar but also a different perspective and approach. I just wanted go bring this back into the main point and not have this be another ""how do I get a pro sounding mix?"" thread.

 * Master Channel volume automation. Usually it should always stay untouched at 0dB. But if you put it down to -1 and raise it to 0 during the drop/chorus/loud part, I heard it's supposed to stand out more without people noticing the difference.

 * ~~BPM automation. Basically the same. someone on here said that it's a usual trick in pop and rock. speeding up the chorus a bit adds some drive, again without people noticing.~~ (EDIT: Apparently this isn't too much of a good idea in EDM. Only do that if you want to piss off DJ's ;P)

 * Also: If you're doing dubstep, you don't always have to try hard to fill drops with lots of stuff apart from your growls and noises. Listen to it in context! Some drops can sound heavier if you have the right buildup that ""introduces"" them. Just listen to Scary Monsters and nice sprites by Skrillex. The drop is just growl-synth and drums. No additional pads or anything to ""widen"" the sound. (I know, the growls are loud and heavy themselves, but the verses etc. have lots of little sparks and a very wide and full sound compared to that) Do some good buildups and some parts can sound heavier than they are. (Scary monsters probably isn't the best example for that, but I also noticed this in some other tracks I don't remember right now. Some choruses/drops are actually weak if you'd listen to them seperated from the rest, but they sound badass with the right buildup). Not only with dubstep but as a generall rule: listen to all your song-parts in context!

 * subtle pitch rises to build up a certain part. Without being too audible(they're not the main synth/melody during that part, that's what I mean), they can change the vibe of a certain part completely. Just recently I used a simple saw wave with glide, going up an octave chromatically. Plus some filter and panning automations to make it more interesting.  

(would be awesome if someone could confirm those haha)

Soo, do you guys know some more of those barely noticeable tricks that make some parts stand out more or some tricks with other effects?

Today we’ll be making [the symphonic pad from Above &amp; Beyond’s *Buzz*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZpx5GiQb4w&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=91s). Epic supersaw pads are the bread and butter of trance, but softer and more symphonic versions like this one are an integral part of the Above &amp; Beyond signature sound, and can be heard consistently throughout their entire discography, from Tri-State to Volume 9.

MIDI: [High](http://www.mediafire.com/?43k5zdu3psgo9ix), [Mid](http://www.mediafire.com/?86098jfn3fbnbsp), [Low](http://www.mediafire.com/?j75srbqxdd18su8).

**The Key**

It seems that the last few episodes have very unison-themed. This one is no exception. The one key to a thick and rich pad sound is massive polyphony.

A large modern orchestra has about 70 string instruments of varying types. To be as classy as an orchestra, a good symphonic pad has to have polyphony on roughly the same order of magnitude.

Adding to the unique character of today’s pad is the fact that it is made of a few layered parts, reminiscent of the different classes of instruments in an orchestra’s string section. This adds to the orchestral nature of the pad, as your ear can tell when each layer is playing different notes.

**Ingredients**

For this three-layer cake, you will need:

* Three instances of your favorite synth. (I recommend Sylenth1 today. Diva, Thor and Sytrus will also do. I implemented this pad in Massive and, for some reason, it turned out all at once brighter, livelier, more metallic and more synthetic. So that was cool too, I guess)

* Some white noise and a filter.

* Two EQs. These will be used to layer the three synths together into a single sound.

* Reverb. This usually goes under the “extras” section, but for this sound, I think reverb is an integral part of the experience, saturating the sound with spectral content and stereo separation.

**Get Cooking**

1. Set up three tracks, each with an instance of your synth and an EQ. Label one High, one Mid, and one Low. Put the appropriate MIDI file on each one if you want. The MIDI is a transcription of the breakdown and then the main loop of “Buzz” the first 16 bars are the breakdown and the last 8 bars are the main loop.

2. Let’s set up the Mid track first, as it’s the first one playing. The Mid pad is two saw waves, one an octave higher than the other. Turn the unison voices way up and then generously detune to achieve the eponymous buzz.

3. Tack on the EQ to the Mid track. High-pass at 300 Hz to take the body out. Now put a deep high shelf cut at 650 Hz. A deep cut; you may have to double up filters to do the job. [^[In ^Ableton]](http://imgur.com/3hGJG.png) A shelf cut, you ask? Yeah, compare with what a low-pass does to the sound. A shelf cut sounds closest to the original.

4. Mids sound good? The High pad is the Mids, on steroids, plus cocaine. Three saw waves, each an octave higher than the next. Max out the unison voices and dial in the detuning to something tasteful; the High pad should sound less buzzy than the Mid. Now add a white noise oscillator to the synth, high-pass it to 10 KHz and turn the volume down until it blends in with the rest of the sound. [^[In ^Ableton]](http://i.imgur.com/QfD5e.png)
 
4. Now for the Low pad. This is less of a huge pad and more of a single cello line that carries the pad’s bass. Set up a single saw wave at -1 octave with a half-dozen voices of unison and a very subtle gentle HP to lighten it up just a tad.

5. Slap your reverb effect onto a send track and add even more space to the sound.

**Garnish**

Sidechain this pad to the kick drum. Aww yeah, like a boss, etc.

You’ll notice that the original sound has a moment right before the drop where the pitch bends up up up and then comes back down again. To imitate this, set the pitch bend range to +/- 1 semitone and automate the pitch bend.

Feel like it’s time to break away from the Buzz imitation? Sweep a low-pass filters over the mix to build up the energy. Sweep a high-pass to prepare for the drop. Try different waveform combinations. Break with with all this unison nonsense and try fewer oscillators for that thinner synthier vintage sound. Distortion. Et cetera.

**Serves One Stadium**

Any questions? What sound would you like to hear in upcoming episodes?

&gt; Still so often people ask me how the hell I created that big ""sucking""-like effect on the main synth, which you can hear starting @ 4:04 -[Massive Attack - Teardrop (Bart Claessen &amp; Tom Fall Bootleg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvCW0Kg2rds)

&gt;Well, I sent the lead synth and the effects of that synth to separate channels on my mixer, and sidechained the FX channel with the original lead channel. Which means that the lead sound kind of pushes away its own effects (and those are LOTS of reverb, delay, and compression). Afterwards, I applied different filters on both channels, separately automated. So I could actually filter down (low pass with resonance) the original lead after it's being sent to the effects bus, which means you can hear that the original lead is filtered down while its own effects are non-filtered loud and clear.

Hope this helps... I can't wait to try it out, myself.

While I don't deny that a lot of sound design is in fact, frequency modulation synthesis combined with resampling, not all of it is. An example, Kill the Noise for whatever reason got automatically thrown into the FM bandwagon, and I've read a lot of users saying his basses are FM synthesis. I know for a fact it's not and want to stop this misinformation. If you don't know how to make a sound, and you can't come reasonably close, don't just make some wild guess and steer someone in the wrong direction. And not everything needs to be resampled x amount of times to sound good. Getting a good sound straight out of the synth is underrated. 

Examples of Massive, and not FM8 include:  

Main bass form   
1. Kill the noise pt. 1  
2. Must Be the feeling (kill the noise remix)  
3. Any xKore tune  
4. Most reeses (which are detuned saw waves by definition)  
  
If anyone has any discrepancies regarding this I can render out basses in Massive akin to those mentioned above with zero resampling and you guys can be the judge.

If your mix doesn't sound good yet, fix it in the mix.

Assuming you have a sub channel, buss or group, you should make sure that your sub is just under the level you are limiting the master track to. For instance, if you have 4dB of maximization on the master limiter, reduce the gain of your sub going into the master by about 4dB (use your ears to get it right).

Since limiting a sine wave just reduces its gain (while potentially adding distortion and artifacts), doing this manually before the limiter will reduce the amount of work your limiter has to do, reduce the distortion and artifacts that reduce the power of your sub, and make it easier for you to achieve a louder track with a balanced sub.

Don't believe me? Try it for yourself.

And he gave me his mastering chain. 

It's an outboard EQ and two linked tube line leveling amplifiers (basically a compressor/limiters). That's it. 

Furthermore, I think the manual for the Waves C4 multiband compressor has the best description of the mastering process. 
&gt;We approach this subject with a bit of sincere care. Mastering is a somewhat misused word at this time, and is not
limited only to making CDs. Anyone who is preparing a “Production Master” for duplication or broadcast is truly
mastering, that is, making the final copy and tweaking it. It happens in film and video (color correction, etc.), in
print, and definitely in audio. This includes preparation of nearly every commercial, show, or production element
in the entire media world.

&gt;The Mastering Guild (the audio group) has emphasized that CD mastering is an acquired art and craft, not an
equipment list, and the most important tools to such an engineer are their ears and their monitor configuration.
They know what things should sound like; the question is how to adjust something to get it to where it can be. It’s
not through presets or guesswork. Historically, it has been through apprenticeships, at best.

[Source, Page 24](http://www.waves.com/manuals/plugins/C4.pdf)

The point of this post isn't to take away from what anyone is doing to master their own material, or to reject the idea that sending a mix to be mastered by a professional is worthless; it's not. The point is to clear up some confusion on what exactly mastering is, and how you should go about learning it or doing it yourself. 

I am not a mastering engineer, but I had one of the best mixing lessons of my life today so I thought I would share the information. 

Mastering begins once your mix is done. Everything is at the right levels, EQ'd perfectly and is sounding like a good mix. Mastering is the process of preparing a track or album for release. 

Objective of mastering:

* Get the audio to a standard level, or ""normalized"" through use of compression and limiting

* Get the track as a whole to have the sound of a professional track, by using EQ's against reference tracks. 

* Bounce the audio into a digital format without artefacts, this is the more difficult thing to do and involves removing problematic frequencies, applying dither and rendering the track in the desired format. 

Tomorrow I'm going to master the most important mix of my life, and I have a bunch of reference tracks and spectral comparisons prepared. I have an excellent listening environment so my speakers won't lie to me and have the mix sound good in only location, and the original mix is sounding delightful. Today was an insightful day for me, so I hope someone else can learn a bit more as well.

So I'm fairly new all this. I know the basics of both FL Studio and Ableton Live. Just recently I decided ""I want to produce music and have my ideas come to life"". I've been a guitarist for almost a decade now and I'd like to explore other types of music. I realized I was a huge EDM fan and figured I'd give it a try. I chose Ableton as my main DAW.

Here's how my usual routine goes as of right now:

* Amazing song idea comes to mind
* Prance around my room singing/humming/screaming it like a crazy person
* Open Ableton live
* Try to recreate what's in my head
* Struggle, lots of struggle
* Accept defeat
* Reddit

I've only been using the program itself for about a week and I know these things take time. I'd just like to know how long it really took for some of you to become comfortable enough to just sit down and make your ideas come to life. I struggled for a good couple hours just trying to make a cool one bar pitch bend-y sound on a bass line and just got fed up.

I won't give up, though! I've made it a personal goal to learn at least one new thing in my DAW every single day, and so far I've been sticking to it. It just gets a bit frustrating, but I know eventually I'll get the hang of it (I remember going through hell trying to learn guitar :P).

Also, side question: I've discovered Tom Cosm's tutorials and I'm considering purchasing a membership on his website to gain access to all of his tutorials. For those who are familiar with him, would you say it's worth it?

However I threw a compressor on the bus, and side chained the reverb to the original signal of the synth, with a really quick attack and medium release. I EQ'd the reverb to give it a high pass at around 400 hz, and it gave this really cool sound. Whenever the synth was playing, there was practically no reverb, but as soon as the note was released, the reverb would rise up and almost suck into the next note.

Every single action has failed and every single request has been met with the same response: 

&gt; While it may sound like a good idea, it would likely kill both subreddits if we tried to split the community in half.

There's a balance between productivity and organization that must be met. /r/WeAreTheMusicMakers had a community that was far, far too general: *anybody even remotely related to the artistic act of making some type of music in some way*. There are people from such completely different disciplines as to not know the first thing about some other person's career. They tried to have less organization so as to include more people for a larger community, but the signal to noise ratio for any one person is too low, so the productivity goes down.

We've split from watmm and formed a community that had a tighter, more specific focus, while still having room for a diverse set of threads. There are a finite number of *types* of threads that are relevant here. You could probably identify fewer than 10, maybe 5. The advantage to having a range of threads in one subreddit is that different sorts of dicussion 'rotate' in such a way as to keep the subreddit interesting to read on a daily basis. We still have few enough types of threads that they will be interesting to most people. We've increased organization, which has provided support for productivity so that there are enough threads to stay relevant.

To split the sub into an organized list of subreddits for these different *types* of threads would strip each one of their intrigue. It's rare for people to want to read many back-to-back threads of the same type. This would increase the organization too far and cause the productivity to plummet because there aren't enough threads to sustain the community and people stop going to it. A link to the sub in the side-bar would not likely avoid this.

So I have been making music for around 8 months and some of my buddies have had a lot of trouble getting inspired and making good music. The beats are clean and cut through, the synth sounds are fresh, the bass is fat, but the song still isn't very good. I've run into a lot of people on the internet, especially on this sub, that say they have similar issues. If this sounds like you, then read on:

**Being a music producer and being a musical artist are two separate things.** People who produce their own music are a combination of both. Sonny Moore was an excellent guitarist and spent a few years in a punk band called From First To Last before he started learning the technology to make electronic music and became Skrillex. What I'm getting at is, it's not their skill with sound design and EQing and compression(although necessary) that makes their music good: it's the actual melodic and rhythmic structure that makes it catchy, and moving, and inspired.

To those of you who do have musical backgrounds this may be obvious, but I have run into a surprising amount of people who know very little about music itself, get really good at using their DAW and VSTs, and are frustrated that the music they're pumping out still just isn't interesting, when they aren't even changing chords, or they're only using 2 or 3 notes in the melody. These guys are excellent producers, but have not spent much time building up creative ability.

While I've only been making music on the computer for 8 months, I've been playing guitar for about 5 years. I've spent countless hours jamming out, experimenting, writing songs and coming up with my own riffs without a computer. I also played trumpet in my school band for 2 years. And the practice and talent that I had built up doing that just naturally transferred to my edm production. Once I learned my way around the piano keys, I was simply using musical talent I started building up long ago. These past 8 months have almost exclusively been spent been learning how to properly use EQ and compression, learning my way around Ableton live, and general mixdown and mastering stuff.

This is not to say that you need a musical background to make ""successful"" music: There is a lot of music out there that does not have very good melodic content but still gets popular because the sound is trendy... Try scrolling down the beatport charts for dubstep... But If you look at the tops of the charts on itunes and beatport and etc. you will find they are dominated by artists that really push the genre forward and make true, inspired ART out of it (Flux P, Seven Lions, etc) and you can tell that they have musical talent and artistic ability by just listening to their music.

So, if you are frustrated that your music is lacking something even though you know how to mix down and do sound design and everything, I ask you this: how much time have you spent not producing a track, but just jamming out? How much experience do you have playing an instrument and getting to know pure, raw music outside of technology and the distractions that come with it?

Sure, you can use midi effects that put whatever you play into the right key, or make chords out of it automatically, or arpeggiate it, or even use an audio effect like pitch correction, it's not cheating... but you are cheating yourself. You will not be making your own musical statement or telling a musical story.

*Music is a language, and you're using google translator.*

While those techniques can be good starting points if you don't know any music theory, they don't work well as primary techniques to create important melodies/hooks in your song.

So, what should you do if you don't know music very well? Start learning the bare minimum of music theory: how to stay in major/minor key, how to make chords, how to recognize the intervals and properly use each scale degree within the scale. This will not teach you how to make awesome melodies, but it will teach you how *not* to sound *wrong*. Then, once you start jamming out and experimenting, you will naturally gain a feel for it and a good musical ear. Lay down at least 8 bars of a fat beat, a simple bass line or chord progression, loop it, and improvise. Rinse and repeat with a different key, tempo, bassline, etc. *Don't* worry about compressing and EQing stuff right or you will lose your inspiration, you gotta get into it, really move to it, really *enjoy* it. When you're ready record it, maybe quantize it, and boom, you have a bangin' section of your song.

If you want to spice up your songs even more, practice jamming out on drums, too. I beatbox randomly all the time and it's great practice. Try coming up with music in your head whenever you think to. It all happens in the brain, and your brain is all you need to practice music anywhere, anytime. Driving, walking, running, lucid dreaming, bungee jumping... You can be making phat beats and riffs in your head with your brain.

Think a pure sawtooth wave. What I'm getting at though is people think fat sound is associated with seeing how many oscillators and effects you can pile up. **nope.** 

Use just one oscillator (or two oscillators with the same waveform) and use just a couple effects at a time and see what you can come up with. Limit yourself. Not only will the process seem intrinsically simpler as you're using less modulations, etc., but you will be able to hear differences you make more rapidly and have an easier time molding a sound than sifting through a jillion filters and phasers and 4 oscillators.

I've been noticing lately, especially with the advent of the circlejerk, that producers with questions related to dubstep production almost predictably get shunted to the side and undermined. Now one reason this may be is that a lot of newer producers may have gotten into the hobby for the sole reason of making dubstep, and thus the questions being asked by them may seem poorly worded or overtly basic. I've not scrolled through pages and pages of edmp for the sole purpose of verifying this, but over last few months it has definitely caught my attention.

We must remember this is a community for producing all kinds of electronic music; one should not have to feel embarrassed or self-conscious if they have a question related to dubstep/brostep/whateverstep. I'd like to discuss what your thoughts are on this; if you find it irrelevant feel free to downvote, but if you think it to be something worth mentioning I encourage you to leave your thoughts in the comments.

I have come to harvest your sweet, sweet self-post karma!

**TL;DR**: [Download this Rack I made](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/632742/Racks/Analog%20Compressor%201.adg). Put it on your drum buss. Turn some knobs. \m/

---

After seeing a not-to-be-named company charging cash money for 'analog modeled' Ableton Live racks that frankly sound like complete shit, I decided to see if I could make a better one. I think I did. Now I want to give it to you for free.

The rack combines Ableton's Compressor and Dynamic Tube, with some Saturation on the end to rein in any errant peaks*. There are Macro controls for Threshold (0db to -20db), Gain (0db to +10db), Attack (1ms to 60ms) and Release (10ms to 200ms). The attack and release of the Dynamic Tube are tuned to that of the Compressor, giving it a pretty smooth quality even at higher gain settings.

Sounds pretty great on your drum buss and hopefully will be a good example for how to create useful, reusable Racks. Feel free to open it up and poke around in its bloody innards.

[Here's a demo](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/632742/Tracks/Analog%20Compression%20Demo%201.mp3). There are break, kick and snare tracks. The only difference between the first 8 bars and the second is that the racks on each track were turned on in the second. If you pull it up and look at the waveform, you'll see that both peak at around the same level. One is just louder (RMS), punchier, and crunchier. Awesome.

[Get the Rack here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/632742/Racks/Analog%20Compressor%201.adg). Put it somewhere and open it up in your File Browser. Drag it onto your drum buss, or individual tracks, or wherever you want. Tweak some knobs until it sounds good. Attack and Release right in the middle should be a good place to start.

Enjoy! Please leave me any feedback or questions here.

**...but this one has some downsides**

I agree that it makes for a more organized subreddit, but at the cost of having less content.  A post that would have 10-30 replies becomes a comment that has 0-3 comment replies.  

People are much more likely to contribute if they are browsing and see a certain sound they know how to make, than if it's buried deep inside of a thread that isn't very content rich.       

**How I think it could be better**

Personally I think a better method would be to re-allow the ""How do I make this sound"" threads, with HDIMITS at the beginning and a tighter set of formatting rules.  This would allow: 

* Searching for a specific song, sound, or artist.
* Anyone who doesn't want to see such posts can filter them out.
* Easy for mods to spot and remove duplicates.
* Over time would become a valuable searchable database of all sound design content up to this time.

Formatting could look something like:

HDIMTS: (type of sound) - (artist), (song)

Someone creates a synth patch along with a very simple MIDI riff.

To make this a learning experience for everyone involved, each winner must post a detailed account of how their patch was created, and the creator of the previous patch must post comparative notes. No effects or layering are allowed, nor are rhythmic backing tracks. This is all about the synth, and how it's made.

I realize there are thousands of VST synths out there, and obviously, not everyone will have access to all of them. So, perhaps limiting the choices of VSTs to the most prevalent ones would be a good idea? A community vote to choose which VSTs should be valid for the competition might not be a bad idea, either, although most sounds can be recreated with almost any VST with a little creativity.

I welcome any further input on this idea, as it's something that just crossed my mind as I was tinkering around in my FM8 library.

Its Ableton based, and Keith fairly regularly puts up some incredibly useful tutorial vids.  Very concise, very useful and inspiring, full of useful tips/tricks and clear explanations of concepts and devices.  I heartily recommend that you put on a brew, fire up their channel and watch every single one.  [Quantize Courses Youtube Channel](www.youtube.com/quantizecourses)

Secondly, Fabfilter got in Tom Worral, a mastering engineer, to do a series of tutorial vids using their plugins... even if you're not a fabfilter user they offer up some incredible insight into mixing, mastering, and probably most effectively with EQ. His style of expaining EQ decisions is the best I've ever seen on the net.  Again, [their whole channel](www.youtube.com/fabfilter) is worth watching all of (and subscribing to), but to get you started here are the EQ videos I'm referring to: [EQ Tips and Tricks](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSNYBbPAvKE&amp;feature=plcp) and [Advanced EQ'ing techniques](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_-PjWts3nI&amp;feature=plcp).

Finally, to watch a man with some prodigious ableton know-how, a very engaging style and a series of batshit crazy ableton challenges, [Tom Cosm's Channel](www.youtube.com/cosmcosm) is an absolute gold-mine.  To see some true music production witchcraft, watch this video in which he starts with a single channel playing a kickdrum, and then proceeds to build a whole techno tune using no additional channels, only sends/returns and a fuckload of automation: [Nothing But Kick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzvvnk6rdNE).  It's over an hour long so you may want to get a brew on, and there is no explanation, but its a very interesting idea very well executed.  His other videos are much more more explain-y.

We've been here since Jan 19, 2011.

Wow. Over a year. Doesn't seem that long. Since its inception, this subreddit has grown far beyond my wildest expectations. I genuinely would have been happy with only a few hundred producers, but look at us now--we're pushing 5,000. I have personally seen a bunch of people casually getting the word out about this place to other people in comment threads elsewhere on Reddit. This is phenomenal, and always puts a smile on my face.

13 months ago, I did not envision what we have today. We have changed, grown, and evolved into a community of which I am proud. I've made friends on our IRC channel (you should check it out, it's a lot of fun), and learned a LOT about production and other completely unrelated disciplines from talking with the people here. Just as an aside, our mods are _awesome_. I could not be any more proud of them.

Importantly, however, with this growth, we've gained a new perspective on an acceptable code of conduct. A larger community than anticipated has shown us errors in some of our previous standards. It's time we've made official adjustments to the EDMP Etiquette. Some of these have carried over from the last version.

---

**Updated EDMP Etiquette** 

Yes this is a bit long, but it's all important.

First, a couple requests:

* We've been getting a fair number of incorrect spam filters lately. When messaging the moderators about this, please include a link to your thread. Even if the title is ""spam filter"" and the body is just a link, it makes our job a lot easier than fishing through your post history to find the thread that was filtered.

* The flair bot is a python script written by one of our mods rxi. It is a program that is always running on my own PC. If my internet is interrupted for even a moment, the bot stops working. Sometimes I don't know it's been interrupted, or I forget to restart it. However, the thing checks very frequently, and will send you a private message telling you whether you've done it correctly. If, after a few minutes, you've not received a message, assume it is down. Please message the moderators letting us know it's down.

Second, the etiquette-type stuff:

* Check your arrogance at the door. 

* **Check your arrogance at the door.** Nobody cares how awesome you are. Self-gloating or other wankery will not be tolerated. This community is **principally** about the next rule. 

* This is community is about HELPING others progress their productions and improve their production skills. This ideal is absolutely paramount to this subreddit. A give and take is to be expected.

* Please have a specific question in mind, not just, ""What do you think?"" Examples of specific questions: ""What do you think about this kick sample?"" ""How's this mix?"" ""I need some help on this melody, the last measure comes off a little cheesy, any ideas?"" etc.

* **ADDED** Along with the previous point, please have a descriptive title. ""i need some help"" is an awful title. ""I need some help with creating this sort of drum pattern"" is a great title.

* Please make an effort to comment on others' questions. Even if you can't give any production tips, you can give an opinion of how it sounds. Production veterans, please be as helpful as possible. Production newbies, please be as descriptive in your opinion, and hence as helpful as possible.

* Courtesy and respect are to be expected. This is a gray area between this and the next section. Yes, it's etiquette, but useless flame wars WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. 
 This also includes bullshit, 
 * ""this is not dubstep"" (Unless you're claiming like a house track is dubstep, or something), 
 * ""shut up hipster"", 
 * ""I'm sick of all these rusko fanboys"", 
 
 or other elitist attitudes. **Please, if you see violations of this, report it.** Violators will be warned. **Multiple warnings may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.** You don't have to like each other, but you do have to treat each other civilly. 

* Oh hey... there's a search function. Please use it before posting a question.

Lastly, some requirements. **Please report all of these:**

* **Absolutely no exchanging of warez or suggestions of piracy. Your post will be removed. Subsequent infractions will result in a ban.** You have been warned.

* If we have any reason to believe you have anything to gain financially from any submission, comment or thread, we will remove it. Repeated offenses will be dealt with harshly.

* Any and all [Feedback] or [Listen] type threads are **NOT** allowed. We now have a [weekly feedback thread](http://www.reddit.com/user/EDMFeedback). Ask for any feedback in the most recent feedback thread. Any threads made that should be a comment in the designated feedback threads will be removed.

* No threads which make it clear the OP has not read the side-bar. It is there for a reason. It's extensive, and it is updated frequently. There is a *lot* of information there to be acquired. 

 This rule includes:

 * ""How do I get started?"" 

 * ""I'm a beginner."" 

 * ""How do you make dubstep?"" 
 
 * Questions about which gear to buy. There is so much information out there--every gear thread is the same.

 For the love of all that is holy, stop posting these. I guarantee all of us think it's fantastic that you love this music so much that you want to try your hand at creating it. This does not excuse you from not reading the side-bar.

* Lastly, other stuff like

 * Hey all, check out my song I just released.

 * Listen to this Deadmau5 track!

 * I'm sick of all this dubstep, lets get some Drum and Bass in here!

I show others and they seem to enjoy it, but I usually feel that it's missing something, and I can't figure out what that is.

So my question to you is **Is it possible that you can ruin your own tracks for yourself just by hearing them too much?** Also I've considered the possibility that I just suck (which is likely as I only have about 10 months experience), so I was wondering if any other producers experience this dilemma.

Brian Trifon is a friend and mentor of ours in San Francisco. He's an absolute wizard in the studio, and relavant to /r/edmproduction for a couple of reasons:

* His [tutorial videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/nextstepaudio) are awesome. This, as many of you know, is rare on youtube (aware that his vids have been posted here before).

* His two man project, Trifonic, just released an album: [Ninth Wave](http://www.trifonic.com/music/) -- highly recommend starting with [Baalbek](https://soundcloud.com/trifonic/baalbek).

* Brian's also extremely approachable. Suggest reaching out to [him](https://twitter.com/trifonic) with advanced, thoughtful, production questions (especially synthesis and resampling related stuff). Hell, he'd probably give a psychotically technical AMA if people asked nicely!

Should also mention that he's who connected us with Scott Pagano -- Their collaboration [Parks On Fire](http://vimeo.com/2388735) blew our minds a few years ago and inspired us to hire Scott for our original [Metropolis teaser](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14zfVItUev8).",,False,,t5_2sa4x,False,,,True,t3_15jw21,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/15jw21/happy_holidays_edmp_lets_talk_about_brian_trifon/,

---

So I'm getting ready to start recording my production lessons for [/r/edmproduction](/r/edmproduction) and my [/r/UniversityofReddit](/r/UniversityofReddit) lessons. Writing scripts for the videos, lesson plans, tweaking my recording setup, etc.

Turns out this shit is hard, son. And even though I have a lot of public speaking experience, talking to no one in front of a computer is surprisingly intimidating.

So, I had an idea that would help me get used to the medium while hopefully providing some interesting content for all you awesome producers.

Would [/r/edmproduction](/r/edmproduction) like it if I recorded a live commentary of me creating a track?

I would be using more of my full sample library and plugin set, rather than the vastly stripped down version (basically the Live built-ins plus Eos reverb) I plan to use to make the lessons more accessible. I wouldn't be able to get as deep into any particular topic since I'll be moving pretty quickly but I think I can still offer up some useful insights.

It would probably be split into a number of reasonably long videos over the course of a few weeks (I don't have a *lot* of time), and I make no guarantees about how good the track will be or how finished other than that I will do my best to make it as good and as finished as any other track I work on, although I may not spend a week resampling the bass on this one...

Got any others?,findMyWay,84,7,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1hmeab/great_post_on_the_why_of_compression_rather_than/,"Most compression tutorials just teach you what the knobs do, but I feel like I need to figure out when and why to use it in certain ways. This post on KVR shed some light on the subject: 

""This is such a difficult and loaded topic to address. But I'll give you my perspective. 

The better you get as a producer, the more precisely sounds will come to you in your head. And when they come to you, once you get ""good"", you will already know what steps are required in the making of that sound. The line(s) between sound design and mixing become blurred. The reason I say this is because if a sound that uses compression as an effect (i.e. compressin the shit out of it) comes to you, you'll see it as such. Just as when you hear a big BWOW-ey bass sound in you head, you know it's time to abuse the ol cutoff knob. 

The other way of compressing (not going for a compressed sound) is usuall more of a problem solving thing. you might say to yourself ""this snare isn't popping enough, but I don't want it to sound compressed, so I'm not going to overdo it."" Or maybe this keyboard part is uneven in volume, or this snare is TOO poppy or whatever. 

The simplest way I can put is: first learn what compression sounds like. Then, if you want it to sound compressed make it sound compressed, if you don't then don't.""

This patch is used for all the growl sounds in this 16-second sample of a remix I did (be sure to download it, zippyshare slaughters audio quality):  http://www2.zippyshare.com/v/72812148/file.html  

Please note, all of the bass sounds are being played on F#1  

Tools: NI Massive, Ableton, SugarBytes WoW  
Base patch: http://www27.zippyshare.com/v/31341170/file.html  
1. Download and install the patch. I'm going to cover everything inside, and then move on to the effects.  
2. I have chosen a bend -/+ for both of my oscillators, as they generally provide the 'wettest' sound when modulated.   
3. The scrapyard osc provides the high-end wet noise, it is created by modulating the wave table position. Take a look at the performers/lfos on it.  
4. The strontium osc provides the bass sound, you'll notice I have heavy modulation on the pitch and intensity. The pitch gives the bulk of this noise, and the intensity gives the sound some movement. Note that the amp of the lfo 5 (used on the pitch) is tied to a macro-control. This is important later.  
5. You'll see that I have two band-pass filters set up. Basically, these intensify that 'wet' sound and help give it some growly movement in the mid-range frequencies by filtering them in and out.  
6. Note that 'restart via gate' is checked in the osc tab. This is probably the most overlooked and most powerful feature to get a clean, loud, centered sound.
  
Onto the effects:  
1. FX Rack: http://i.imgur.com/1mh8B.png  
2. WoW: http://i.imgur.com/4m0Ux.png  
3. Set everything the same. We use WoW to give it the talking sound, and again we are using a band-reject (the opposite of band-pass, same effect but reversed). Everything else is self-explanatory.  
4. YOU WA SHOCK is a free plugin, its essentially soundgoodizer from FL studio. It's cheap and frowned upon, but a quick way to get a nice nasty sound (although muddy). Preset A @ 100%  
5. Sausage fattener isn't really needed. It's set @ 15%.  
6. Try cutting this sound at 90hz and layering it with a sub.    
    
Modulation:  
1. Play around with the macro control 2 on the preset, and the vowel cut-off in WoW. Try different vowel sounds for different effects, and even try binding more macros in massive.  
2. WoW: http://i.imgur.com/C2wDl.png  
3. Massive Macro Control 2: http://i.imgur.com/KxbqS.png

Really there's nothing to it, just record yourself opening a soda can (try to get even stereo width), open the recording in your DAW, and snip out the cracking sound where the can bursts open (when the metal breaks and the carbonation is released). Equalize it however, and some reverb makes for a nice trail.

It's simple: you turn up your entire mix until you notice some element is becoming too harsh or annoying, then you bring the monitoring level back to normal and fix that element (turn it down, EQ, whatever). Then, turn the entire mix down until some element starts to drop out. Go back to normal monitoring level, and address that problem, most likely with some sort of boost.

There's been a number of threads recently either linking to VST repositories or posting someone's favorite free VST. While a lot of these are great, a lot of these are just links to huge groups of VSTs that nobody here has actually checked out. It also adds a lot of mostly non-discussable noise to the sub for a single plugin that will eventually be buried. And this sub isn't a VST link dump, if for no other reason than the fact that *reddit is a terrible archival link repository* (just try looking for something specific in r/VSTi :P).

So I talked to some of the mods and they like this idea: instead of posting links, let's collaborate on [a spreadsheet we can put in the sidebar that has all of our favorite VST plugins](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjkiCMIyE3BodE5hWGxhRlY3Mmkyd3BOdVIwZFpyM1E#gid=0)!

As someone who has been producing for 6+ years and working in the industry for the past year, one of the biggest problems I see aren't amateur producers, like that post suggests, but rather people posting to topics plainly wrong advice or suggestions and acting like they know *exactly* what they're talking about.

I know when I started out, I tried to absorb everything that I could about production and the industry. Amateur producers come here looking for help and information but are instead met with an elitist, ""I know everything I'm talking about"" attitude paired with wrong information.

As an example, I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1h7u5e/edm_songwriter/) asking for help finding a good songwriter. Half the people who commented seemed to believe that I need help writing synth melodies, and the other half seem to think that every song in the history of music has been written by one person (For reference, most songs are written by 3-5 people. As an example, Zedd's Clarity was written by 4 people, which included Porter Robinson and Matthew Koma). It's responses like these that perpetuate misinformation, when instead we could be helping each other make the best fuckin' music we know how.

Tools: NI Massive
  
Explanation: The signature property here is the band-reject filter, it is what gives the bass its wet growling sound. The point of this patch is not to give you a single demonstration of a melodic splatter bass, but rather a tutorial on how to create your own growl across your own note and waveform. Each note makes a drastically different sound for growl synths, so I always produce it over a constant note. To take this patch up a few notes, you would need to adjust the band-reject filter accordingly. Feel free to ask questions in the comments.  
  
1. You need a single modern-talking oscillator. The bend -/+ gives the majority of waveforms a nice wet sound. The pitch modulation gives it the dropping sound, and the amp modulation will cut the growl off after 1 bar. Route to a single filter. Configure it as so: http://i.imgur.com/ch7VJ.png  
2. You need a band-reject filter. High-resonance gives it an even wetter high-end. Configure it as so: http://i.imgur.com/weORS.png   
3. A single insert: http://i.imgur.com/hVOSy.png  
5. LFO 5 can be adjusted to your taste and texture, but mine looked like: http://i.imgur.com/q2ykD.png  
6. LFO/Performer 7: http://i.imgur.com/9O7pQ.png  
7. For the FX, I used a tele-tube and reverb. T-tube at default settings, reverb as such: http://i.imgur.com/WZFpo.png  
8. Note that my final sound was compressed with [YOU WA SHOCK !](http://www.winamp.com/plugin/you-wa-shock-/221523), AKA Sound-goodizer in FL Studio. I use Ableton. Any compressor will do fine. If you want my exact settings, it is config A @ 100%.

I plan on having ""classes"" at set increments. Probably something like weekly, bi-monthly, or monthly. I hope to have a screencast for every class as well as a downloadable Live session. (anyone have a spare screencasting software license for Mac?) I'll demonstrate techniques on the screencast and have you apply that knowledge to the session you'll download.

I will also encourage that you post it publicly so that students can check out one another's work.


Seeing as how this course is for *you*, I want to know what you want to see in this course.

- Should this course be designed for someone with absolutely no musical experience whatsoever (read: going over rudimentary theory before really digging into Ableton) or should I assume you guys know the basics of songwriting? (major/minor triad construction, writing chord progressions, writing melodies, etc.)

- How frequently do you want me to post lessons?

- Should this course start after most colleges let out (I guess a few weeks from now) or should it start ASAP?

- What other suggestions do you guys have? I'm looking into RedditU, but this train has really crappy internet, so it's hard to actually get much information. (And barely being able to read about the Galaxy S III announcement because of a shoddy connection is killing me.) Please let me know what you guys want to see in this course and what you want to get out of it.


Okay, last thing. I'm a music production and music business student who will be releasing his first edm album this summer or early fall. As such, I'm really low on funds. **This course will be absolutely free**, but I will be accepting donations and will be offering one-on-one lessons via Skype (or in person if you're in the Philadelphia area) for a small fee.

I saw loads of topics and threads about mastering and since I've subscribed to this subreddit, I've noticed the topic keep popping up.

I've had scores of tracks and remixes mastered at pretty much every major mastering company that does dance music and here's a few points about what I learned:


**What is mastering?**

Mastering in dance music is the craft of fixing glaring mistakes and trying to use the source material and manipulate it in a way that makes it sound as best as it can.

Mastering engineers will typically use, compression, EQ and limiting in order to make the track sound as fat, wide and punchy as possible.


**Why use a third party mastering guy?**

I believe hearing someone else master your work is actually quite a good thing, as it lets you hear roughly how much better your track can sound and where you went wrong in your mixdowns. 

Having someone who has not spent dozens of hours on your track means that they have a bit more perspective than you, they're not lost in the track.

**Can you polish a turd?**

No you can't polish a turd, but you can make it shiny! Lots of mastering engineers in dance music often deal with tracks that are produced poorly and they will make it sound as good as possible, but they can only manipulate what's there, they can't fix and perfect a track because they simply don't have THAT much control over your tracks once it's been bounced.


**Can I master stuff myself? (Is mastering needed) **
The most important part of your production (aside from creative ideas) is the mixdown. If your shit is mixed tight and perfect, then your track is basically mastered already. You just need to do a bit of level gaining with a limiter etc...

Almost every single thing that a mastering engineer does or fixes can be addressed by you at the mixdown stage.

**Howcome my tracks aren't loud enough?**
That's because you haven't mixed them right...


**A few quick notes**
- If something doesn't sound right and it's sent to mastering, it will sound better but it will still not sound right

- Not all mastering guys are always awesome, sometimes you get a bad master. Mastering guys are humans too, they have good days and bad days, do good work and bad work.

- Try making your mixdowns sound as good as you can without any mastering plugins.

- If your tracks sound shit hot with just a limiter thrown on at the end, then you have got a pretty good mixdown

If you do not know the history of dance music, the players involved, and what this was all originally about now is a great time to learn. I'm sure many of you got interested in electronic music much later and didn't grow up with this stuff, but if you are going to produce electronic music you should have some understanding and appreciation of the history or you are bound to follow the mistakes of many and create vapid, ungroovy, music that plagues beatport and main stages of festivals.

1345826491.0,79,self.edmproduction,yrf1z,Here's a few ways to get width and depth in a mix,PutMyDickOnYourHead,91,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/yrf1z/heres_a_few_ways_to_get_width_and_depth_in_a_mix/,"I saw this posted somewhere on the internet a long time ago and I found it helpful. Maybe you guys will find some useful techniques in it too.



Ways to get width and depth in a mix:



1.) Chorus stuff. Try chorusing only one side of a signal. Can be cool with clean electric guitars.



2.) Flip a side on a stereo track out of phase, mix in 3-6 db underneath the other side.



3.) Haas effect--delay one stereo side on an element or two by 10 milliseconds or so.



4.) Make an aux buss with a pitch shifter on it: detune one side by 6-16 percent, and tune up the other side by 6-16 percent. I.e. left is pitchshifted -6 and right +6 percent. Classic trick.



5.) Buss a few things to an aux with a delay on it. Go sparingly. Ping pong delay can be fun on high hat.



6.) Create an aux buss with a stereo widener on it like Waves S1. Run various stuff to it.



7.) Put a flanger or phaser on an aux buss with a panner. Run a few things to it ever so slightly. You shouldn't really hear it, but you should notice when its gone.



8.) Create a drum buss, route stuff to it. Put a bit of a room verb on it... now smash it with a limiter. Throw into your mix a little bit.



9.) If you are doing primarily sampled drums ala electronic/industrial music try running a mix of the drums to a set of speakers in the live room. Now mic the room in stereo. Add to mix. Fun, fun, fun.



10.) Create a buss and run some snare to it. Pitch shift it down an octave. Mix it in a little bit.



11.) Put 20 milliseconds of delay on your room mics to make the room feel bigger.



Add some of the above ideas along with proper and judicious use of reverb and your tracks will take on new life and size.



If you need the sounds to have 'verb but still stay present in the mix you need to pay attention to the following:



1.) You're running the 'verb as an aux buss or send, right? Not inserting it in the track and playing with the wet/dry ratio, right? Also, make sure the verb is 100% wet on the aux buss. That way you get 100% of the dry sound, plus however much 'verbed sound depending on how much you buss to the aux.



2.) Pre-delay is your friend. That gives the dry sound a chance to be heard before the 'verb cloud starts building up. 20 milliseconds is a good starting point. Anywhere from 10 to 60 milliseconds is common. That will keep things up front, but with ambiance.



3.) Brighter 'verbs feel closer to the listener. Use a shelf or lowpass filter to knock off some top end off the verb. Try a roll off around 3-6 khz for starters. Will move the 'verb in the background, but let you get some mileage out of it.



4.) Time the verb (RT60) to work with the tempo of the song. Works wonders in reducing the sonic clutter.



5.) Dampening absorbs high freqs over time, so the front of the 'verb will be brighter than the tail, making the verb feel more distant. Try that too.



6.) Try increasing the low end decay time or shortening the high end. That's how you get huge without being too spitty on top.



7.) For percussion the main thing that determines the ""size"" of the space is what's happening on the snare. Maybe less overhead 'verb and a bit more snare. Heck, multiple 'verbs on snares work... I've ran a nonlin, plate and room simultaneously in the past and would do it again. Tweak it right and the snare stays front and center, but is big with a nice decay to it.



8.) Setting a balance between early reflections (ER) and the reverb tail is a key to the psychoacoustic distance the listener will perceive. Don't go nuts with the ER's, it can sound a bit weird on many sources and feels closer. Less ER's seem to put things in the distance. However, sometimes it is fun to put a lot of ER on percussion and keep the tail muted a bit.

I spent the last month trying to understand all the responses, went back to my theory books, played on the keyboard a bit more, etc. 

The reply from facetheduke caught my attention: ""Some is modal rather than minor. That may confuse the software depending on how good it is or isn't."" 

So I went on a quest to understand modal music and how often is being used in EDM, and here are my conclusions/perceptions, would you guys confirm or deny them, please?

1) The ""danceable"" parts of most EDM songs are modal. They don't seem to have a well defined chord progression.

2) The breakdown part of most EDM songs are tonal. They have a well defined chord progression.

3) A lot of EDM songs avoid cadences. There doesn't seem to be a  sense of conclusion.

4) Above 3 points help make EDM danceable.

I would love to hear your thoughts.

You can do this by taking the synth plug in and triplicating it, then adding a low pass filter to one, a band pass filter to another and a hi pass to the third. Fiddle until there's neither too much overlap nor space between the three channels. 

2) Add reverb to the high signal. I'd suggest about 75% wet signal with a pretty spacey reverb - you don't want a rattle or echo effect though. I'd also suggest adding an eq after the reverb and rolling off the highest ranges, although not all the way off.

3) Add slight overdrive and chorus to the mid signal. Open the synth patch and find the dominant sound wave. Duplicate that wave (either in the patch or by adding yet another instance of the synth) and then detune both waves by the same amount in opposite directions. It will likely only need be about 5 cents.

4) Boost the bass signal a bit using an eq or bass boost plug in. And either a subtle phaser or automate the threshold of the filter you placed on it on (1) with a random sine with low range (that is, you only want the threshold moving slightly) . This helps create movement in the sound without destabilizing it. 

You might also want to alter the waveform and envelopes in the bass to prevent it from getting to croaky. Increasing the attack of the volume envelope is a good place to start. 

5) Route all three through a bus and add compression and a saturation plug in (the free camel crusher plug in is sterling).  Eqing again and slightly boosting the main frequencies (use your ears or a graphic eq - don't boost the fundamental freq but go for the second or third instead for some brightness).

6) Finally - and I think this is what a lot of you are missing - wide chords on the MIDI input. Use root, octave, fifth above that, another octave and a third above, for example. Leaving space at the bottom and only using third/seventh notes well away from the root note helps make a chord sound big without it being muddy.",,False,,t5_2sa4x,False,,,True,t3_ngb7q,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/ngb7q/quick_guide_to_creating_the_full_synths_you_kids/,

1353190002.0,72,self.edmproduction,13dbtp,Synth Recipe 6: Clicky FM Bass,mark-henry,84,12,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/13dbtp/synth_recipe_6_clicky_fm_bass/,"Today we’ll be recreating the bass from [“Keys To The City” by MiM0SA](http://youtu.be/oraTOij6wi0#t=36s). It has a sub bass low end and a very distinctive clicky top.

This will be our first foray into FM bass synthesis! Instantiate your favorite DAW and let’s get started.

**The Key**

An FM dubstep wub is made by simple waveforms FM-modulating each other. More FM makes a brighter sound, and when you turn the FM amount up and down, it makes wubs.

Different styles of wub are made with different combinations of waveforms and FM modulation routings. For example, a more “vintage” sounding wub is made with two sinewaves, an octave apart, and the high sine modulating the low sine.

This recipe describes another simple routing configuration.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* An FM synth. (Ableton Operator, Sytrus, FM8, etc.)

**Get Cooking**

1. The first and most important thing is to modulate the FM amount. You can bind it to an LFO [^[In ^Operator]](http://imgur.com/7P9aa) or you can bind it to your mod wheel and wub manually, which is pretty fun.

2. First, get some sub going. Set the global transpose to -12 semitones and your first oscillator to a sinewave plus the first harmonic.

2. Now for the modulator. Set a second oscillator to a saw wave and have it FM the first oscillator. You’ll get some ridiculous distorted sound, so turn the modulation way down until the sound mellows out a little. (Or, if you’re working in Operator, turn the second oscillator’s volume down. -19dB was a good setting for me.)

3. Now have the second oscillator modulate itself. [^[In ^Operator]](http://i.imgur.com/mPfN9.png) Set the modulation amount to about 50%.

4. Put a 24dB notch filter at 500Hz, with the resonance turned all the way down.

4. Now the fun part. Mess with all the parameters until you like the result. I recommend messing with the partials of the second oscillator. Playing with the Phase knob can also have some very dramatic effects. In Operator, I also recommend turning the master “Tone” control all the way up, and setting the “Repeat” control for the second oscillator to “Off;” this makes the tone of the second oscillator much, much brighter.

**Finishing Touches**

I believe that it was said by High Rankin in his master class: a tiny bit of distortion can turn a bass completely on its head. And don’t forget about RoughRider, the star of [last week’s show](http://redd.it/11fs68).

Because the sub is overwhelmingly loud, a little bit of EQ is essential to mixing this bass. Shelving the lows 5-10 dB is a good idea.

**Serve Shaken, Not Stirred**

Hey r/edm! I've been producing with ableton for about 8 months now. As a beginner I'm obviously always looking for that thing that will make my music just that much better. In the past it's been my discovery of massive and some other higher end vsts as well as buying some vengeance packs. The two things I'm realized were missing are my little knowledge of mastering, and my little knowledge of synthesis.

So I've decided to finally do it and take the time to learn all I can about synthesis! I won't stop until I can create all the sounds in my head as well as recreate the sounds in my favorite songs.

I've learned the basics (I'll post what I've learned below and maybe you can critique anything I have wrong), but now I don't know where to go. **My question is what's next? Where do I find articles and videos etc. on intermediate synthesis and then advanced etc. until I've learned what I want to.** 

And here's a summary of what I've learned so far. Please let me know if I've got anything wrong. If there's a ""?"" after it means I'm not sure. 

Oscillator (OSC): Produces waveforms. As frequency of waveforms change pitch of note changes. 

Velocity: This is basically how hard or fast a not it played and the resulting sound.

Gate On/Off: When on sound won't pass through to output.

Envelope: How the waveform acts over time. This is generally measured in ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, and Release). Attack is how long it takes a not to reach it's peak volume. Decay is how long it takes to ""settle"" at a specific volume. Sustain is how long the note remains at that volume, and release is how long it takes for the note to go silent.

Sine wave: One frequency, no harmonics? (I'm a bit confused on frequency/harmonics) The actual wave form is rounded, and it produces a soft sound generally used for sub sounds.

Saw wave: Harmonic frequencies at all whole numbers? It creates a harder buzzing sound.

Square wave: Harmonic frequencies on odd numbers? Sort of a mix between a saw and a sine creating an almost hollow sound. 

Triangle wave: Like a square only harmonics get quieter as time goes on. Sounds similar to a square, but softer?

Highpass filter: Allows high frequency sounds to pass through while cutting out low frequencies as the cutoff is turned up.

Lowpass filter: Allows low frequency sounds to pass through while cutting out high frequencies as cutoff is turned down.

Bandpass Filter: generally cuts both high and low when cut off is in the middle, but as cutoff is changed it allows a certain range to pass through.

Bandreject filter: generally cuts out mid range frequencies when cut off is in the middle, but as cut off is changed gives two ranges of frequencies.

Low Frequency Oscillator (LFO): Generates a very slow/wide waveform, and is usally used to modulate other waveforms. When an LFO is used to modulate a filters cutoff the typical wobble sound is produced.

Additive Synthesis: Combining waveforms to create new sounds.

Subtractive Synthesis: Removing frequencies to create a new sound.

FM Synthesis: Using waveforms to ""modulate?"" other waveforms. FM synthesis is unpredictable and the ways sounds interact can only be memorized.

**EDIT:** I am beginning to believe I should be organizing this contest. I am thinking so far that it should be focused on the free VST soft synth, Synth1. If the contest proves to be even a moderate success, I'd like to have future iterations of the contest give attention to other freeware softsynths or combinations of softsynths. 

The big question remaining is how the contest should be judged. I would love to have some input but I already have some ideas:  

* Should there be voting? If not, who should judge? 
* On what criteria should a patchmaking contest be judged? 
* How should people submit demos of their patches? Should there be one demo song MIDI that everyone has to arrange to their patch? 
* What kind of time frame would people like to make their patch? A few weeks? More time? Less time? 

Also, I have no idea what to do about prizes or if there should even be any. I proposed the idea of a contest because I'd really like to see what a competitive spirit brings out in people all making patches for one synth at a time and I never felt like prizes needed to be a part of that. 

-----
**EDIT 2:** Let's hear ideas for themes! (And if you don't think we should have themes, you should say why.) 

Some ideas for themes I have are: 

* Patches attempting to recreate actual instruments
* Single patches that work ~~well~~ as chords, leads or basses
* Standards with twists: e.g. reese basses that are different ""somehow,"" supersaws with a touch of something new and special, ""warm pad"" with a unique sparkle, etc.

Just a small update, which I hope everyone will get a chance to read:

In an on going efforts to improve the content quality of the subreddit, and with the influx of ""How do I make this sound?"" posts, we've decided it would be more beneficial for everyone to have a regular thread (similar to the feedback thread) where people can ask their ""How do I make this sound?"" questions.

We've decided on pushing this idea since it has several obvious advantages. There are often quite a lot of ""how do I make this sound?"" posts, and, similar to the feedback posts they often tend to only serve the person asking the question, or at the most a very small demographic. The thread would also have the advantage of consolidating all the ""How do I make this sound"" questions, Having one page with all of them would be ideal for the people who would usually benefit from the responses to these kinds of questions.

We'd also like to ask that, like the feedback posts, any ""How do I make this sound?"" post outside of the designated thread be reported. Reporting a post flags it for the mods so that we're guaranteed to see it.

Hopefully this will help in making the subreddit a better resource for everyone. We want more content which *everyone* can benefit from, ideally anyone of any skill level would be able to use the subreddit and take something away from it.

Thanks for your time!

Many electronic names have their tracks produced and engineered by other people, sometimes secret, sometimes not. The most common one is David guetta who has had all of his albums and singles produced by different people, which gives his name a huge boost to make a living from touring as a dj. 
In the progressive house scene, a producer called Christian Hirt produces tracks for up to 8 different artists such as Dinka, EDX and Daniel Portman. Everyone knows about this but nothing is ever really mentioned about it. 
I was asked recently about doing it for somebody for $120 per track, even though sales wouldn't reach that. I turned it down as i see it is quite bad taste, but it made me wonder what everyone else thinks of it.
 Would you do it? 
What would be your price?
would you pay somebody to produce for you? 
Would your view of an artist change if you found their tracks were made by somebody else?

I find I'm very shy about dancing unless it's in a dark, crowded club where i can hide in the crowd and not feel self conscious.  Better if I am with a girl.

I'll start.,valiantism,78,3,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/t8rki/what_are_some_of_your_favorite_production_tips/,"I'm sure alot of us have picked up useful tips and techniques over time, so lets share!


* Side-chain compression can be used for much more than just drums. For example: have a bassline and a lead fighting for the same space? Some subtle side-chaining can solve that. It's also a great way to get a vocal track to sit in a mix. The key generally is to use it subtly. If you want to get really fancy with it, set up a multi-band compressor!


* Reverb. A mix-engineer once told me that if you can hear that a track has reverb on it, then there's to much reverb on it. Granted, massive reverbs defiantly has its place, but a subtle *almost* inaudible reverb can make a synth or sample really come alive. The same can be said for delays.


* Parallel-compression (aka New York-compression). Set up a compressor with a high ration, low thresh-hold, quick attack and a quick release as a send effect. My mixing the dry track with a heavily compressed version can give a really nice body to a channel (or whole mix for that matter) while still retaining some of its dynamics.


* The Haas-effect. The haas-effect is a great way to give mono synths/tracks stereo width. The effect is basically to make a copy of the channel you want to apply to the effect two, delay the copy 3-8 ms (by either a delay effect or simply moving it). Then pan the tracks hard left and hard right. Voila, a huge stereo track! If you have ability to send a stereo synth to two mono-channels you can use this technique as well.


* Multi-band distortion. A great way to give a synth/sample some grit is to use several different types of distorion on different frequency bands. Generally it's a good idea to give the lower bands less distortion to retain some of the base-tonality, while you can go crazy on the upper bands. A personal favorite of mine is to use a tape-saturator on 0-4khz and a bitcrusher on everything above 4khz.

After a little research, I found a company that manufactures the actual sirens that the police use and they have samples of each noise from each siren model.  Use [the manufacturer's website](http://www.code3pse.com/code3/resource_library/#), navigate to ""Siren Tones"" to browse the samples, then use the links provided here to easily download it.  I prefer the Mastercom B model's sounds.  They will **direct download** in an .flv format so if you don’t have something to convert .flv to .wav or .mp3, use a website like [Zamzar](http://www.zamzar.com) to convert it for free.  Open the sample up in an editor and trim it to your needs (it will come with a small blip at the front of the sample that you will definitely need to trim).  Then configure the sample in your DAW to play the sample only when designated.  In FL Studio for example, load the sample, right-click its channel and [select cut itself](http://i.imgur.com/sAshhZU.jpg), left-click the same channel to open its settings, look for Precomputed effects and bump the CRF (Crossfade loop) just a small bit until you see a red line appear at the start of the sample ([located here in section 6](http://i.imgur.com/0GkAJ4m.jpg)).  Once the sample is ready for use, play with its EQ, add some reverb and anything else you would like.  Now you have a siren that you can completely control.

So sure, I definitely want first crack at music that is genuinely unreleased (especially if it's being pitched to me as such).

That said, there's no hard and fast rule to signings. We've released tracks picked up off SoundCloud, and we've given official release to songs that have been ""out"" but were never snagged by another label. Honestly, outside of a couple ""first!"" internet types, no one cares all that much. If music is genuinely good when it's put up for free, it will still be good when we give it a proper retail release to a wider audience. Most music is still ""new"" to the vast majority of people out there, and most music sent in for demo consideration isn't getting signed anyway!

In regards to etiquette though, my biggest gripe isn't SoundCloud freebies. It's people sending ""personal"" emails with 20 different label demo addresses in the cc field. Or those charmers who cap things off with a p.s. to the tune of ""other labels are interested in it, but I wanted to offer it to you"" - why, so we can sign a social climber?

If being signed is that important to you, you can learn to be patient enough to wait a bit after sending your tunes to labels before offering it up to the public yourself. In the meantime, there's no reason why you can't give away dope tracks that aren't signable in the first place (bootlegs, tracks with crazy samples, etc.). Or throw up a snippet of an original if you're just that anxious. But it's better to breathe.

Be original, make good music, don't be a dick. Repeat steps one through three. You'll be fine, whether you're signed or not

I might be able to unbrick it, a tricky process I'm going to attempt this coming week. From what I gather Seagate will fix it for free only for retail drives, not if it came with a new computer, like mine did. I didn't even know it was in there.

While there is still hope that the data is intact, I currently have no access to my finished tracks, my unfinished projects, my samples. I'm oddly calm about it.

Learn from my mistake and back up your stuff. Do it now. External drive it, cloud it, save your sets and samples. An OS, your DAW and your VST's can be reinstalled - your precious files cannot.

If you want to check out my Electro House-ish duo, Zulu Company, you can hear some of our stuff [here](http://soundcloud.com/zulucompanymusic) and our Facebook page [here](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Zulu-Company/116138360795).


I realize this first video is long, I wanted to adress a bunch of basic funtions for anybody who is just starting out. My future videos will be much shorter and more focused on a particular sound (example: Zedd bass in Massive tutorial). I would also love to get some requests if anybody wants to make a particular sound that I can help them with, feel free to message me!


In the comments you'll find a download for the Live Pack with all the samples in the tutorial, as well as the final bounced samples for anybody who's not using Live and just wants to try out the samples for their own track. Thanks again for helping me out all these years!

Here is the reality of that happening!

How it works:

I am planning on creating a large sample pack with only submissions from users of this subreddit. Each week we will have a different type of sample to submit. I will collect all the samples and figure out a way to judge them (I need judges). At the end we will organize all the samples in to a large pack and put it up for download on the subreddit.

Keep in mind:

1. All submissions must be original. No stealing or sampling. We don't want to get in trouble.
2. Email your submissions to edmpsamples@gmail.com as an attachment. We don't want to have to go through the comments to find download links.
3. Try and keep the samples well named/formatted. It would be good to name the sample something that actually makes sense for the sample. Also, it would be a good idea to include your reddit username in the email.
4. Be creative. We have an incredibly diverse range of styles on the forums, so we'd like to take advantage of that and have a nice, diverse sample pack.

Schedule:

Week 1: Kicks

Week 2: snares/claps

Week 3:Cymbals

Week 4:Percussion

Week 5:Loops

Week 6:FX (risers, dives etc.)

Week 7:???

Who knows how long this will continue!

***********************************************************

**Week 1: Kicks**

For the first week we will obviously be doing kicks. Not much to explain here, just submit your samples to the email address above. Stay creative and put some effort into the samples you submit.
Thanks!

-	With neurofunk, I like to start a track by playing around with rhythms and grooves. I don’t do anything too fancy, just lay down a pretty standard 2-step beat, and play with the cymbals.  
-	I loop this for around 8 – 16 bars (starting at the 16th bar of the project, to have room to develop an intro or build)  
-	Now I tune all drums to a pitch that sounds good with the vibe I’m going for (you can use a sine wave patch and play a note, then tune the drum to this easily)  

**Basslines: ** 
-	This is where the fun really kicks in for me. Grab your favorite bass patch (could be anything, 808, sine, modern talking even!) and make a rhythm with it (don’t focus on melodic content, as this is funky shit and shouldn’t be constrained by the limits of scales and such)  
-	Beef up your bassline (no. don’t reach for the sausage fattener. Don’t.), add additional harmonics with duplicating patches and changing things slightly. You want it to sound very harmonically rich, and movementalicious.  
-	Reduce the mud as much as you can (EQ, vocoder set to modulator etc), but don’t lose the dynamics, they are key to ultimate funkiness.  
-	Bounce this all down (have at least 16 bars of various rythms) and chuck in a sampler (or just another audio track) and process again (I use harmor before this to put a nice overall chorus/distortion/unison effect over it)  
-	Layer various versions of the bassline with each other (crossfade for some awesome effects), process some more (make some interesting builds with filters and such) and generally stuff around making it more interesting.   

**Ambience/leads/other synths: ** 
-	I’m not as good at these as of yet.   
-	Tons of random sounds/samples work well, along with tonal content to compliment other parts of the track  
-	Process with heavy amounts of effects to get weird warped sounds, but keep low/mid-range to a minimum during the drop as it will diminish the effect of your bassline  
-	Clean everything up, cut any sub you hear from them, or at least make it quiet enough that it’s not interfering.   

**Mixing and mastering: ** 
-	As a rule for myself, I like to keep the whole track in the green while doing all the structuring and creation of the track, as it will lead to a more optimal sound.   
-	The kick and snare should punch just out over the bassline and hats can be turned down as quiet as possible (unless they play a key role in your rhythmic pattern, think friendly intentions by noisia’s drop beat)  
-	Slamming the crap out of your track with compression/saturation will do you no good. You need to be extremely careful when playing with the dynamics of a neuro track as it can make or break a track. Although, if you want it to be louder, warm saturation is best, as it keeps dynamics intact, but clips transients. Be careful, and always reference the unmastered version with the mastered version.  
-	If your master turns out bad, you have a bad mix. Almost always.  

I think that covers the basics of neurofunk, but I can answer any questions you have (and can describe how to make most basses that are used in the genre) If there is any interest for the project file of the track, I can upload :).

- I have made a seperate Word document for each genre and placed them all in a zipped folder. This was the easiest way I could think of to do this.  

- **If someone can upload these to Google Docs and post a link in the comments it might be much more convenient. (I couldn't get Docs working)**

- If anyone has any issues with downloading or being unable to open the documents, please let me know, preferably with a solution.

- I sorted everyone into groups based on your comment. If you're unsure if you might be in a genre group or not **check anyway**. 

- Open the document and use Ctrl + F to find your **username** not artist name.
 
- Ctrl + Click on the other members of your groups' usernames to open their profile, and send them a PM from there.

- **Make sure to send the other members in your group/groups a PM**. This is the only way this will work.

- Together with everyone in your group, **decide on a way to communicate.** 

- I recommend [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) for this purpose.


-----

Possible Issues

- You may be in a group with two people or four people due to numbers problems.

- If you feel you shouldn't be in a group and want to leave, send the members of that group a PM, not me. **Don't do this just because you want to be in a group with different people.**

- If you feel you should be in a group and you are not, request via PM with the members of that group to join, not me.

- If you missed out on the submission thread and want to join the previous point applies.

- I may have made a few mistakes amalgamating genres that may not be similar even though they have similar names. Apologies if that has happened, nothing I can do about that now. 

- I also included a spreadsheet with all the genres and their members in the folder. **I feel that if one of the mods could sidebar a link to that spreadsheet in Google Docs or whatever it might be useful for future reference or contacting members of a genre for help or whatever.**


Any problems? Post in the comments below.

Thanks to the helpful Jewfag_Cuntpuncher they are now on Google Docs  https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B_1O3X-etoUaM1AwTy1rN2VMUEE

Also another suggestion came up for communication which I think is excellent is to create a private subreddit for your group with all members as moderators and approved submitters.

I have been producing on Fl Studio since I was about 14-15 years old (19 now), but didn't start taking it seriously up until my junior year of high school. I have always focused more on the technical aspect of music production rather than the musical side to it. I have very, very basic knowledge of music theory and the piano. I came across a Q &amp; A by Madeon on here the other day and I read a question where someone asked about learning mixing/engineering and an instrument at the same time (I think? I can't remember exactly what the question asked or stated). He replied with something along the lines of 'good mixing/engineering comes with time, learning to play something that allows personal expression is what should be focused on'. Lately I've been attempting to teach myself how to play the piano with my Yamaha keyboard and a self-teaching adult piano course book I picked up from Best Buy. Of course, I know it's a LONG process to learn the piano and that it's not gonna happen overnight. I know basic things such as the notes, chords/chord progressions, scales, etc..but I don't know how to actually play the piano. I'm getting tired of making my melodies and chords from the click of my mouse because it is very limiting and I want my productions to be more musical as well. I want my music to have life, expression that comes from my heart and soul and not the click of a mouse. I also want to learn to play this incredible instrument because it has always been my favorite. I want to be able to create melodies and chord progressions by actually sitting down, away from my computer, being able to create them and play them by hand. Is it a good idea to start this? I'm still learning more and more about music production each day and tend to focus more on mixing/sound design/mastering, rather than learning the piano and the rules to music.

1350050255.0,65,self.edmproduction,11d5r1,Friendly Reminder: Ask good questions!,aedile,75,10,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/11d5r1/friendly_reminder_ask_good_questions/,"I really like this sub.  I would consider it a high-quality, high-content community for producers of all levels.  That being said, there is one thing that plagues any sub of this nature: continuous repetition of the same 20 or so questions over and over and over again.  With that in mind, here are a few tips for asking questions in this sub:

1.  Google is your friend, as is reddit search.  If you have a question, choose a few basic keywords about what you are trying to do and Google it.  Chances are you are asking a question that has already been asked, and Googling it is the quickest way to get an answer.  Reddit search can be helpful as well.  Some people dislike it.  If you want reddit-only results but hate reddit search, try using Google and adding ""site:reddit.com"" to the end of your search string.

2.  Before asking any question, make sure you try to figure things out for yourself.  Let's face it, making music isn't an easy pursuit.  One of the most valuable tools for improving your skillset is trying to figure things out on your own.  Want to know how DJBluntz is getting that wicked awesome kick sound?  Chances are, somebody here knows exactly how to do it, but you'll learn a LOT more if you at least tried to figure out part of it on your own.  Anybody who's been producing for any length of time will tell you that this kind of exploration is invaluable.  While you might find the answer to your question, more often than not you'll discover something completely different that is exciting or useful.  

3. Ask your question well.  Be very clear/specific about what you are asking.  List out the steps that you have already taken on your own to answer the question yourself.  If you are referencing a track, link to it.  Be sure to link specifically to the point in the track that you are referring to if that is possible.  If you are working with specific tools, be sure to mention that so others using the same tools will be more likely to chime in.  

4. Choose a title that is specific and concise.  This is just courtesy.  A good title will direct people to or away from your question depending on what they are trying to get out of the sub.  

5. Above all, learn your craft!  Hang out here and read all the questions, especially the ones you don't know the answer to.  If you don't think it pertains to you, read it anyways.  You never know what you'll find in the comments.  If you have feedback or know the answer even partially, by all means comment!  Did you read a jargon term you didn't know?  Look it up, memorize it, and use it where it's appropriate.  The more you learn about making EDM, the better your questions will be (and you'll have them less often to boot).


There is nothing wrong with asking questions.  Everybody will arrive at a point where they need outside help at some time in their career as a producer.  Asking a good question will get you better answers and they'll arrive more quickly.  Above all, it will keep our sub clean and content-driven.

It's pretty amazing how effective it is. 

For example, I produce dubstep. So, after thinking a section of my track was perfect, I listened to a country song a friend sent me. Going back to my track and listening to it again, I heard very subtle things, such as minutely displaced samples, parts that were a little too quiet or too loud, and even thematic elements that needed tweaking. 

Most likely if you are working on a track, you are spending tons of time with your track, hitting play and stop over and over again. This can really lock you in on a track for more than you desire. I recommend this ""trick"" to anyone to prevent that. But, I also recommend just finding your own way to completely flush your ears before returning to a track. I doubt this is the best method, and there are definitely people out there who are more creative than I am.

We're back with genre competition #4. This genre was invented by our previous winner, maplesyrupismajestic.

Your mission is to create a track in the following fictitious genre. Interpret this genre description however you wish, and create a song that 

fulfills your vision of this genre. You may use any sound sources you desire in this competition.

Genre: Etiamunda

Tempo: Adagio, 66 - 76 beats per minute.

Time signature: 4/4, 6/8, or 7/4.

Instrumentation:

    Natural percussion, especially tonal-mallet instruments (marimba, vibraphone, etc.)

    Long droning chords in deep pads and airy harmonics.

    And highly rhythmical synths with shorter articulations such such as pizzicato, trills, glissando, staccato, marcato, etc.

Characteristics:

    History: Sheet music recently discovered in an old stone hovel unearthed in an excavation in Cumbria gives us Etiamunda as the first hint at 

modern music composition. Cumbria is the place where the musical Skiddaw Stones were discovered in the early 1800s and the person who discovered 

them had also been, we have good reason to think, highly trained in classical instrumentation. Mixing the two elements of the Stones and classical 

instruments the composer discovered new worlds in music that no other before had attempted.

    Structure: Inspired by the long rolling hills in Cumbria, the composer decided that music should be written in even ratios: for every crescendo 

there must also be an equal decrescendo. Based upon this simple formula, the composition structures used were: ABA, ABCBA, AABBAA, ABCCBA. In fact 

'Etiamunda' roughly translates from Latin as ""Even Wave.""

    Time frame: After analysis of the nearly 400 of the compositions we've discovered that no composition the composer wrote in Etiamunda exceeded 

1:40 seconds. It's still one of the great mysteries of music as to why this was, but the leading theory is that the forum in which all of the pieces 

were performed was outdoors and no stringed instrument of the time could stay in tune for that period of time outside.

Ancillary:

    Cumbria is a cold place for most of the year. The land and forests are dark green and the rocky hills dark gray. Compound this with the fact 

that it rains there often and is as often foggy, the nature of most of the pieces are extremely solemn and depressing. To achieve this the composer 

often used the Dorian and Phrygian modes when not using the natural minor scale.

http://www.banjolin.co.uk/modes/dorian_mode.htm
http://www.banjolin.co.uk/modes/phrygian_mode.htm

    In a note found in a journal the composer wrote the following: ""The system of waves coming in from the ocean is miraculous: they are at first 

shallow and even, then they build and build, then at the apotheosis they crash with magnificent thunder and slowly return back into themselves until 

they are but a trickle on the beach. Should not everything in life be the same? Should not every music be so modeled?""

    Sometimes but not always the compositions would change time signature and key at the climax of the piece then return to the original time 

signature at the decrescendo.

    Natural harmonics within the strings were employed often.

This is a continuation of the last genre comp as it would be a shame to waste those tracks.

The submission and voting form will be presented when MWD finishes it
and there will be an update as to how and where

(if there are any issues, i've set up an SC for submissions and we'll go that route sot here's a back up plan if needed)

deadline isnt wholly decided but the *latest* it will be is the 16th of feb, this might be brought forward as it's a continuation but subsequent genre comps will be one month long

1348271139.0,61,self.edmproduction,109wrb,"Synth Recipes, Episode 2: Bright Lead",mark-henry,75,14,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/109wrb/synth_recipes_episode_2_bright_lead/,"Today we’re going to be making the bright lead synth from [MiM0SA’s *Keys To The City*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oraTOij6wi0&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=71s), suitable for bass music, pop, beats and whatever else it is that the kids are into these days. This is another beginner-level sound, and it’s very similar to the lead we implemented last time. In this episode, we’ll also invite you to get familiar with the overtone series and the Oatmeal VST.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* A synth that lets you edit the waveform manually and has a unison feature. I recommend Oatmeal, the free VST that everyone should own. Grab a complete Oatmeal pack with skins and preset banks [here](http://rapidlibrary.com/files/fuzzpilz-oatmeal-vsti-all-in-one-pack-rar_ulzxbfnvfri89on.html). Ableton Operator will also do the trick. Thor will get you to the basic sound, but you won’t be able to manually play with the waveform.

**The Key**

This sound is powerfully simple: a single oscillator with tight unison for flavor. It demonstrates that an energetic and charismatic lead doesn’t have to come from an expensive effects chain.

**Get Cooking**

1. Preheat your synth to saw wave degrees Fahrenheit. In Oatmeal, first load an empty patch, then right-click on the sinewave next to Osc. 1 and pick Saw. Set your amp envelope’s sustain to 100%.

2. Find your unison control and put it at 2 or 3 voices. In Oatmeal, you’ll find the Unison controls [here](http://i.imgur.com/bLoC7.png). In Operator, you’ll have to make do with the Spread knob; in Thor, get a Multi Osc going. Find a nice sweet spot for the detuning. Not too narrow, not too crazy.

3. Now set the overall voices to one (so that when you press two notes at once it only plays one of them). Set up some 30ms portamento/glide and boom, you’ll be able to play MiM0SA’s melody! ([Here’s a MIDI file](http://www.mediafire.com/?osh87apnq2p3o4o) for those of us without a keyboard, and for those of us who have a keyboard but are lazy.) (Portamento in Oatmeal is a bit tetchy, so [here’s](http://imgur.com/FWSAm) what the three controls should be set to. The middle one's at about 30ms.)

**Tweaks**

You’ll probably notice that MiM0SA’s synth doesn’t match up exactly to what we have here. He’s got some EQing in the mix — a dip at 5 KHz and a boost above that — but the real trick is that he’s not using a saw wave, exactly. So the final step is to play with your waveform and change up the sound.

Now’s the time for Oatmeal’s user-editable-waveform feature to shine. [Bring up the custom waveform display](http://i.imgur.com/CDKM9.png) and start playing with the bars. Each one of these bars represents a volume control on a sinewave. Each sinewave is tuned to a specific frequency in the overtone series. (Math.) Each member of the overtone series is called a harmonic.

Wiggle them one by one. Now move a bunch at once. [Chop holes in the series](http://imgur.com/1OSrC) to make weird timbres. Go crazy because this is fun-exploring-time. You’ll probably notice that the lower harmonics individually have more of a say in the final sound than the high tones. Now go for subtle, wide changes and try to bake a little more analogue warmth into the sterility of the saw wave.

My final recommendation is a little compression. That’s about all you need; the power of this sound is in its simplicity. Like too much soy sauce on the finely seasoned and vinegared rice used for sushi, reverb or delay would overwhelm the subtle stereo separation flavor of the unison effect.

**Serve With Fresh Beats**

Hi, welcome to a thing. Each episode, I post a step-by-step recipe for a specific sound. This is a new thing, so please tell me what you think in the comments. These first few episodes serve as an intro to basic sounds for beginners, so if single-oscillator leads aren’t exactly unexplored territory for you, well, stay tuned.

[Take a look at my bassline lesson!](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/v817q/a_simple_lesson_in_creating_basslines_level/)

So let's say you've thrown a song together but are missing the key piece of the track - the melody. Without this the listener will probably not remember it as well as they would have if you had a great melody in it. That's what your listeners will be humming far after the song is over (there are exceptions to this but most generally this is the case). To put it plainly, the better the melody the better the track (as goes many things but this piece is important). I'm a strong believer in production values so don't take that for granted but a strong melody in someone's track will win me over. 

In this lesson I'll be going over one of my more melody-driven tracks. I'll be going into it one layer at a time so you can understand where I came from while producing it.

****

My first song example is called Daylight Crossing Train. You can listen to it [here on Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/373797). It was featured on a [flash game](http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/576557) that ended up on the front page of [joystiq.com](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/08/13/sorry-did-you-want-game-news-were-too-busy-playing-symphonic/) and I happened to have the starting song for the game. To put it plainly, hundreds of thousands of people listened to this song and what made them love it (at least some of them) was the simple but catchy melody. I really don't pride myself in this song since it doesn't have the best production values in it and is a bit too simple but it works great as an example here. 

Let's start with my chord progression. I tend to make my chord progressions before the melodies. And when that gets satisfactory I then make the rest of the song. The song will showcase the melody so if I can't produce a good one I end up dropping the song altogether. (That will happen, don't worry about it. Just move on and keep working hard!) [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/zd5qq.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?1ql03vu19smupxx)

**** 

Now onto the actual melody. I'm using a piano sound for this track as I love a good trance track featuring piano. Let's take a look at the notes first. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/knF3C.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?7hhbtttjmeee3ui)

A great way to start any melody is to have a simple rhythm going every 2 measures. Keep that rhythm consistent, (most likely) the more you tamper with this the less it will be memorable! That doesn't mean you can't mix it up but if you have random rhythms going throughout your melody it will be hard to instantly put that (and keep) in someone's head. That ""likeable"" factor dwindles down as well.

Other than rhythm stick to what you know about your chord progression. Keep the notes within their scales. This song is the perfect example. Once you can get a handle on this kind of melody writing you can really get crazy and end up with some cool sounding songs. EDM in general is about repetition. There. I said it. What keeps the song going in EDM is the layering and the progression through the changing layers whereas in classical music (and other genres of music) you have the actual progression driving the song. Melodies don't repeat as often as they do in EDM. You can have the most simple melody in EDM and it can be a big radio hit. 

[Here's an mp3 of the melody in the song](http://www.mediafire.com/?ytpce3ju5rd2ko9)

****
Let's break this down even more. Here I have a simplified version of that piano melody. [Picture](http://i.imgur.com/S8i1A.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?7e2da20pqcv2zxs)

What are the notes in the simplified melody compared to my chords? **[A picture I'll be referring to.](http://i.imgur.com/NPpeN.png)** Take the first note of each measure. I've labelled them accordingly to what they are in the chord progression. You can see I stick to playing the 3rd or root of the chord. This doesn't mean you shouldn't play any other notes but in this example I'm keeping it simple. What I did later on was put on some ""sprinkles."" [Picture reference](http://i.imgur.com/ddk68.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?re8p4rz1lxwtz61) This is the perfect example of how a simple melody can become much more complicated. 

**For you more experienced producers out there**, I'm throwing in passing tones and adding another voice to my melody (to keep it interesting during the longer notes that the original melody had). Some other examples you could possibly use are turns or mordents. I can't see them being used very often in EDM but I'm sure you could throw in a couple here or there. Wikipedia it or Google those if you want more information. I'm not the best person to give lessons on counter melody or some other tips on how you can make more complicated melodies. Read/buy a book on music theory, and look at voice leading. That will definitely get you a better idea of where I'm coming from and will be better than me giving you what partial definitions of I remember from 3-4 years ago.

So there you have it. A breakdown of my melodies in a song that's driven by melody. If you have anything to add, feel free to leave it in the comments! And for my next lesson, I'll be going into lead synth making. If there's anything else you'd like me to go over in future lessons, let me know!

I'm preparing for a friend's wedding today and can't respond to all the new comments just yet but I'll get to them tomorrow.  I greatly appreciate the time you have taken to respond and share your knowledge and opinions.

So I had an idea I wanted to discuss and see what everyone's thoughts are on it.  First, a little background.  Before recording technology, music was ephemeral, it was unique every time it was performed and heard.  That ephemeral quality has dissipated somewhat with the invention of records, tapes, CDs and hard drives, though for most non-electronic / non-DJ performances the music does change when it is performed live.  Now with the rise of the DJ, almost everything you hear is pre-recorded.  True that the mixes will sound slightly different sometimes but it is still performed with pre-recorded materials.

Onto the idea:  what if a song was a living organism, that every time the song was played back on a device, the sounds, structure, content and subtle timings would be different?  The overall style or theme would stay the same, but the permutations would be endless.  Generative music has existed since the 18th century, where some composers (Johann Philipp Kirnberger for example) used dice as an element of chance in determining the composition.  Today generative techniques are used very commonly especially in electronic music.  But once the piece is created, it is recorded and made static.  What if songs were not only written, but CODED so that each song had it's own special algorithm that determined the result?  Even further, since these songs would be streamed / preloaded off the internet, you could determine the listeners location, and tailor the song to things like the current weather the person is currently experiencing.  You could also take live data from recent news articles, the stock market...the possibilities are insane.  Think of it like how like a generative digital art piece works...it is different anytime you run it, but the overall style is the same.

Icarus' album Fake Fish Distribution did something like this, but they only had 1000 versions ('only' lol, but hear me out).  I'm talking about the song being different every time it is heard.

I'm thinking of a web application that would act as the interface for users to browse 'songs'.  The system would keep say, 10 different recordings of the algorithm's results in a queue, dropping the oldest one and adding a new generation every hour or so.  Or in cases where live data is needed, perhaps the generations are created on-demand in order to be tailored to things like the aforementioned weather scenario.  

Maybe sometime way in the future, this kind of thing will be common...but right now I'm thinking I'd like to do this just for a single album or EP.  What are your guys' thoughts on this and does it give you any ideas?  Do you think this is even feasible or worthwhile to attempt?  What kind of statement does it make about how people currently consume music?",,False,,t5_2sa4x,1349456907.0,,sc,True,t3_10xs4s,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/10xs4s/an_idea_ive_been_toying_with_songs_as_living/,

As you may or may not know, /r/edmproduction has been lucky enough to have three very talented artists take their time to answer your questions. We're also happy to say the Glitch Mob will be coming to do an AMA in the very near future. However, to prepare for this and any future AMAs, it is important to set up a few rules. 

**Things you should not do when commenting on an /r/edmproduction AMA**:

 * DO NOT post questions unrelated to electronic music production. Be smart here. The mods will have final say over what qualifies as a good question.

 * DO NOT leave a top level comment without a question. These create unnecessary clutter in the thread and make it harder for the OP to find quality questions to answer. Nobody cares how much you love *artist name here*.

 * DO NOT plug your own music / attempt to receive feedback on one of your songs. These artists probably all have promo emails, use them.

 * Before asking a question, make sure it hasn't already been asked, especially common questions, i.e. favorite vsti.

 * **DO NOT plug your own music / attempt to receive feedback on one of your songs. These artists probably all have promo emails, use them.**


**Things you should do when commenting on an /r/edmproduction AMA**:

  * Keep your questions concise. Nobody has time to read an essay when we've got 500 people asking questions.

  * Use bullet points when asking multiple questions.

  * Be respectful and appreciative (don't be a cunt)

  Any comments breaking these rules will be subject to deletion by the mods. We are very lucky to have these artists take their time to answer our questions, do not waste this opportunity by filling the thread with joke questions and useless internet ego stroking.

I can make a nice full sub that sounds great on systems with a wide frequency response, but on decent home media systems it's practically nonexistent.  

My guess is that my subs are hitting out of the frequency range of more general systems.  I've tried compensating by writing in higher keys, which helps but still just doesn't quite match that nice full sound you'll hear in professional tracks.  

As I understand it, a sub should generally be a single sine wave, with as little compression as necessary, as a smoother sine will move more air (thus produce more power).  So my subs are very simple, generally just use operator(in ableton) with a single sine, dropped an octave, an eq with a hi cut around 250 Hz and a compressor with a ratio of about 1:2-1:3 and attack around 5ms.  

I've heard of people adding squares, or two octaves for their sub.  While I hear this adding color, it doesn't add fullness.

I just feel like bringing this to the attention to newer producers: If you can get a good understanding of how sound design, fx processing, and music theory work, you can make any kind of music you want to. I know there are definitely variations on some techniques but you can usually use your ears to determine what's different. These skills (mixdown and sound design skills) take a lot of time to learn. Don't feel discouraged if you've been producing for a year and can't make whatever genre you want to make immediately. The best thing you can do is use the tools (synths, FX, daw) you have, learn them inside and out, and improve your skills as much as you possibly can. You have to have the patience to learn. a LOT of patience.

this isn't meant to offend anybody obviously, just trying to point out that if you're newer to production, you're not going to be as skillful as someone who has been producing for a long time. And that's okay. good luck producing :)

1373596575.0,57,self.edmproduction,1i4lgm,I came up with a workaround to make the flair soundcloud links clickable,adamnemecek,67,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1i4lgm/i_came_up_with_a_workaround_to_make_the_flair/,"I got annoyed by the fact that you cannot click the soundcloud flairs so I made a bookmarklet which will make all soundcloud links clickable. To use it either: 

1. go to this [site](http://mrcoles.com/bookmarklet)
2. paste this code into the text field 

        (function() {
            $('span[class*=\'flair-sc\'][title!=\'\']').live('hover', function(evt) {
                var e = evt.target,
                    t = e.title.replace(/^http(s?):\/\//, ''),
                    $n = $('&lt;a/&gt;', {
                        html: t,
                        href: 'https://' + t,
                        target: '_blank',
                        class: $(e).attr('class')
                    });
                 $(e).replaceWith($n);
            });
        })();

3. click the 'convert to bookmarklet' button 
4. drag the link that will show up to your bookmark bar


alternatively you can create a new bookmark and put this as the url:

    javascript:(function(){$('span[class*=\'flair-sc\'][title!=\'\']').live('hover',function(evt){var e=evt.target,t=e.title.replace(/^http(s?):\/\//,''),$n=$('&lt;a/&gt;',{html:t,href:'https://'+t,target:'_blank',class:$(e).attr('class')});$(e).replaceWith($n);});})();




If you then click the bookmarklet button, it will make all soundcloud flair links clickable. It's not the best solution but it's currently the only option since reddit does not allow links in flairs and you can't really get around that. 

EDIT: I made a small change to make it work with the RES infinite scrolling. 

**EDIT2: Another approach is to install Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey and then this script http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/173111 .
The advantage of this approach is that you don't have to click on the bookmarklet to activate the links every single time, once the script is installed it will just work^TM.**",,False,,t5_2sa4x,1373614447.0,,,True,t3_1i4lgm,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1i4lgm/i_came_up_with_a_workaround_to_make_the_flair/,

TUNE YOUR KICKS!

--------this is not just for dubstep/trap, I produce house!------------

So I've spent hours and hours going through so many different mastering chains on my master channel, changing compressors, eq's and everything you can think of both on the master and kick channels I had. Still I could not get a sound that felt professional to me. I had seen and heard many times about tuning your kicks, however I felt like anytime I tweeked kick samples my sound always got muckier. But, I finally gave in after watching a [recent video](http://youtu.be/z2Ean7sG-jQ?t=4m38s) from my heroes Dada Life. 

Now, I disclaim that this will not make everything you do sound amazing, but this has reduced the amount of work it takes to make a sample sound good for me almost ten fold I would say. One other tip would be to try Dada Life's Sausage Fattener plugin on your kick as well. I guess I owe Dada Life a lot!

Quick Outline for Tuning Kick on Ableton 9:

* 1. Pull up drum rack with a kick playing on it's own channel.
* 2. Insert a ""Spectrum"" from Audio Effects in the browser.
* 3. With the kick playing through the Spectrum look at the wave form produced, it should look like a hill.
* 4. Pick out the top of the hill and hover your mouse over it. be precise.
* 5. A box will display by your mouse telling you the frequency and also the ""note"" of the frequency, e.x. G#1
* 6. Use transpose function in the drum rack to change the pitch of the drum in steps to either the tonic or dominant of the key of your track and ""detune"" for even finer tuning. e.x. I hover the mouse it says G#1 and my song is in F, I set transpose to -3 and my kick should be at an F now.

note: In my short experience I've found you don't want to be transposing a sample more than around 4 or 5 steps max, so find a different sample that is closer to being in key, or ideally already in key!

note 2: experiment using this technique on snares and any other percussion you like.

Happy to answer any other questions you might have or direct you to more learning materials related to the subject!

EDIT 4/4/13- There's tons of good advice in the comments below and different methodologies explained. Sounds like a consensus agrees that ideally a sample should already be in key requiring no transposing, as suggested per my first note (unless you want dissonance).",,False,,t5_2sa4x,1365108844.0,,sc,True,t3_1bneju,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1bneju/tiptutorial_get_your_kicks_to_finally_sit_nicely/,

It's very noob friendly which makes learning this synth a breeze. 

It's got 2 synths that both have an LFO table, and each synth has 2 oscillators and a master control. It also has an envelope editor where you can manually adjust the wave pattern (Pretty fucking sweet, in my opinion). It has a main controller which controls volume and pitch. It also has a built in chorus, reverb and distortion controller.

I'm not affiliated with the developers of this VST or anything like that, I just freaking love it so I thought I should share it with others because it's a great go-to vst for learning.

In my opinion, this synth is on par with Massive. And it is completely free.

The vst is called Tal Noisemaker.

My tip for you guys to become a better producer may sound wrong, but it worked for me.

Learn how to mix a song correctly (-3 dB to -6 dB of headroom), learn proper subtractive EQing and proper use of compression, learn what to do in every situation.

THEN FORGET THEM.  I don't leave that much headroom, I don't use subtractive EQ; my mixes sound better than before by being relaxed and not following every rule/step to mixing a song.  What do I do now?  I throw a limiter on the master and mix at -0.3 dB and lower the volume to -3dB after I finish the track and ready for master.  I never do subtractive EQ, subtlety may seem good, but sometimes you need to just crank up a frequency of a snare or a bass.  

**EDIT**: Before you say that what I do will hurt my music, I do high pass, low pass unneeded frequencies.  I don't use subtractive EQ like a lot of ""professionals"" tell you to, I use it when I want to/high passing/low passing things.  My mixes are becoming better because I only break the rules once I understand them.

I'm not saying don't follow proper mixing, but become comfortable and start experimenting with the way you mix to become comfortable.

From the few tutorials that I've found on chord progressions and how to use them within this genre, it seems that the most basic arrangement seems to go like this: 8 bar loops, with one chord per two bars, preferably ending on the root chord for a nice resolving cadence, loop the first few bars of the loop before the release/break, use the root chord for bass, etc. I usually go this route with some variations, and it has been the most rewarding, however, I feel like I keep running in circles and my tracks are starting to sound too similar.

Other variations I've seen, like I've seen on MIDI files (the ones where you can easily tell the chord progressions the artist started out with, like Avicii's stuff) involve a much faster-changing loop. IE every bar contains two chords, 3/4th of the bar for one chord and the last 1/4th for another, etc. 

Some variations seem more like ""chord stabs"", where there is a bit of silence between each chord and there's more of a melodic pattern to the loop.

My question is, how is each variation used? I think the problem is that I don't understand the exact purpose of chord progression loops. I know there's more to it than just ""play the root note with the bass, and make your melodies resolve to the top note of the chord"".

Now, please let me make this clear, I know there ~~are no rules to music~~ no magic formula. I've made tons of tracks before I decided to settle on a common workflow from which I can add variations or express myself better. I know the golden rule of ""if it sounds good, go with it"". I can bullshit along and find a nice loop that sounds good once  every blue moon, but it's hard to fill an entire track with it.

How do you guys write chord progressions? What patterns do you use? How do you split them up? Are they supposed to define a melodic pattern or are they more like guidelines for the chord/notes you should focus on in a particular segment of a track? How do you derive melodies and bass lines out of them? How do you go from chord progressions to an entire track?

Are you a Redditor? Do you want to collaborate with way too many others? Do you want a new car?  If you answered yes to any of those questions, you are invited to participate in the /r/edmproduction collaboration!

Unlike past attempts at massive collaborations, we have an organized plan of attack.  This project will span two months, and everyone will be assigned to a specific part of the project.  Signups are open until next Sunday (June 1).  If you are interested in participating, please read the plan below, sign up at the link at the bottom, and head on over to /r/edmproductioncollab to begin discussing the project!


What follows below is the original post from /r/edmproductioncollab:


Welcome to the first r/edmproduction collaboration; this is going to be a great project! To make everything work smoothly we need to have some organization, and everyone involved needs to uphold their end of the bargain. We welcome anyone with any skill range, from any genre background, and with any level of experience! But please only sign up if you know that you can deliver what you promise.

Contributors to the collaboration will be assigned to a particular team. When you sign up, you will rank your top three preferences. At the end of the signup period the Core Team (/u/Bahgel, /u/Retriax, and /u/Khedgey) will divide up everyone among the teams, and hopefully everyone will be placed on their first or second priority team. However, just because you don't get placed on a team does not mean that you cannot have a hand in that part of the process--please feel free to contribute suggestions and help to any part of the project. In fact, we encourage inter-team communication! Teams will be responsible for doing the bulk of the work in their area, making final call regarding creative decisions in their area, and providing their products by the deadline. When designing the teams we will try to make sure each team has a balance of experience levels so hopefully people can learn through this process. No team will be left without someone who really knows what they are doing.


The teams are as follows:

* Composition Team (Writing the core structure of the song)
* Lyrics Team (Writing the lyrics/phrasing/melody for the words)
* Rhythm/Samples Team (Creating the beats and rhythmic structures)
* Melody Team (Writing the melodies)
* Sound Creation Team (Creating the sounds for the basses, pads, and melodies)
* Vocal Team (recording and then engineering)
* Arrangement (Combining all tracks into the final arrangement and adding connective tissue)
* Mixing Team
* Mastering Team

The schedule for the project is as follows:

* Signups (Until June 9th) -- Please sign up using the link at the bottom of this!
* Idea Phase (Week 1: June 10 - June 16) -- Everyone that wishes to be involved discusses an idea for what direction the song should go in. Do we want to make a Porter Robinson style pulsing trance song? Do we want to make Daft-Punkish stuff? Danceable song? Or chill song? Do we want to have a concept and try to send a message or tell a story? Or just let it be fun? Of course this will change as the pieces are put together, but this will give the composition team an idea to run with. We will leave the discussion up for three days then decide on it by what looks like it gets the most interest.
* Song Composition (Week 2: June 17 - June 23) -- Everyone on the composition team works together to compose the basic blocks of the song, charting out a structure (i.e. ""4 measures of build up, 8 measures of beatdown, 8 measures of drop out,"" etc), and a basic chord structure for the song. They can work on this through skype, exchanging snippets on soundcloud or dropbox, telephone, whatever. At the end of this period, they should have a completed demo of a song, even if its just some stock piano and pad sounds over some stock drum loops, maybe even some rough ideas for melody (vocal or instrumental), just to give everyone the draft of the song structure. A .wav file of this demo will be the structure that the rest of the song will be based around.
* Lyrics writing (Week 2: June 17 - June 23) -- Working with the Composition Team, the Lyrics Team will write the lyrics, melody, and phrasing. At the end of the week they will produce a vocal demo (quality doesn't matter) and a text document with lyrics written.
* Rhythmic Structure (Week 3: June 24 - June 30) -- The Rhythm/Samples Team will pound out the rhythm of the song and create those tracks. Did the composers call for a sexy samba beat for these four bars? Rhythm team can provide. Did the composers call for an uptempo build up? Rhythm team has it under control. At the end of this week, the Rhythm team will provide Tracks of all rhythm parts of the song.
* Melodic Structure (Week 3: June 24 - June 30) -- The melody team (3-5 people) will take the composers' instructions and create melody. Do the composers call for an ascending intricate melody with counterpoint behind it? Melody team will provide. At the end of this week, the melody team should provide all necessary melodies for the song in notation form and preferably Midi files. Once again the sounds themselves don't matter, that's up to Sound Creation Team, but Melody Team can provide ideas for what sort of sounds they had in mind.
* Sound Creation (Week 4: July 1 - July 7) -- Sound Creation team (3-5 people) will take the chords from Composition Team and melodies from Melody Team and create kickass sounds for each of these. These are the guys that will be digging hard into Massive, Nexus, or pick your other favorite VST. At the end of the week, they will produce individual bounced tracks the length of the song for each instrument/sound they create.
* Note: If some of the sounds depend upon other sounds (i.e., side-chaining a compressor on a synth to a kick drum to make the sound ""pulse"") please provide a bounced track of the sound with AND without the sidechained effect, along with notes as to how the sidechain works. Sidechaining for an effect like this can need delicate tweaking during the mixing phase, and this will allow the Mixing Team the opportunity to do this.
* Vocals (Week 3 - 4: June 24 - July 7) -- The Vocal Team can begin working as soon as they have the structure from the Song Comp team, but they can work even better when they have the melodic structure from the Melody Team. This team will write the vocals, record them (either themselves, or they can bring in someone they know), and cut them up/remix them, so that at the end of the week 4 they have a full vocal track for the song
* Arrangement (week 5: July 8 - July 14) -- During this time, the Arrangement Team can take the tracks that exist already and arrange them into the full song. They will also add in any connective tissue to breathe the track to life. Clicks, pops, stutters, swells, reverbed stuff in the background, etc. At the end of the week they will have tracks for each effect and sound, ready to give a full set of tracks to the mixing team.
* Mixing (week 5 - 6: July 8 - July 21) -- The mixing team can begin at week 5, once they have the tracks from the Sample/Loop Team, Sound Creation Team, and Vocal Team. This is where they will do the necessary hard core mixing/engineering. At the end of week 5, they will have the full arrangement from the Arrangement Team, to create a final mix.
* Tweaking (week 7: July 22 - July 28) -- The finished mix will be given to the whole community so anyone can comment on it. If something needs to be added, removed, or tweaked, now is the time! Everyone should be paying attention during this week so if their team is needed, they can quickly respond to what is going on!
* Mastering (week 8: July 29 - August 4) -- Mastering, and then KABLAMO the project is finished!
* Throughout the project the Core Team will be behind the scenes pulling everything together. We will be checking on the teams' progress, and when the teams submit their finished product, we will take care of organizing the submitted files and tracks in a central location, and will constantly keep the most final mix possible available to everyone. Did the rhythm team tweak something last night? We will add in the new tracks and then redistribute the new mix.

Submitting finished work:

* We will be using dropbox to organise and collaborate.
* You will need a dropbox account and you can get one here: http://db.tt/AbWGZdM (please use the referal link as we will get more space)
* You do not need to make a new dropbox account if you already have one
* There will be folders for each team and you should be able to work out how you are going to organise it within your team.
* However please try and make the folder structure tidy and easy to understand with folders for categories. For instance sort it by date or who made it.
* Preferably keep your files in wav, project files and MIDI.
* Each team will have their own folder in the dropbox, and every time something is submitted, create a new folder within the team folder named by that day's date in the format DD MONTH YYYY (i.e. 07 JULY 2013). To submit sounds, please upload them in .wav format.

General Notes:

* It will be very important for these teams to work together within themselves; rather than 3 different people submitting their own versions of something, each team needs to produce 1 finished product.
* The deadlines will be absolute, and teams need to have their finished product submitted when they are scheduled to do so. If after submission, a team comes up with a better product, or wishes to change their contributions to better fit what others have submitted, they can do that for a few days. (Say, the melody team wants to tweak something based upon a cool groove the rhythm team created.)
* When uploading sounds, please upload them with no external reverb, compression, or EQ, (outside of what is necessary to create that specific sound) as these effects can make mixing very difficult. If you wish, feel free to add notes on what kind of extra effects you would like on the track.
* If you wish to include notes with your submission, please add a text file in the folder with the uploaded files.
* Everyone is allowed to give feedback on something after a team has contributed their piece, and teams are encouraged to go back and incorporate the suggestions into their submissions and submit them again.
* Teams are encouraged to contribute more than the bare minimum. The sound team can contribute 3 different sounds for the melody instead of 1, and the Mixing Team working with the Core Team, along with input from the entire community can make the final call on which one makes it into the final mix.
* Help other teams with suggestions or discussion, but please don't be upset if they do not use your ideas or advice--this is a collaboration, and micromanaging everybody else's part of the project takes the fun out of it! Try to be respectful of other people's contributions, even if they aren't what you had in mind or are not as good as you could have done. Even better, if they aren't as good as you can do, why not help them do it better? Send them a message or post in the subreddit with helpful advice, links to videos or tutorials, and give constructive criticism.
* Everyone will be on only one team, except for the case that we do not have enough people sign up to fill each team--in this case, some people may be assigned to two teams. But don't worry, if you don't get placed on your first choice for team, this will be a good growth opportunity for you! And if this project is successful, we will do more in the future, and you will be on a different team next time around!
* There will be only one project, unless we have more than 50 people sign up, in which case we will begin splitting everyone into multiple projects.
* Please be patient with us, as those of us organizing this are only simple redditors like yourself. If something isn't going perfectly smoothly, or you have an idea of how something could be done better, please do not hesitate to contact us with your suggestions!

When we hear the final song, if it's good enough, we can talk about putting it on spotify and other forms of digital distribution. And who knows? Maybe this could become a regular thing, and we could repeat this process every three months! Also, once the project is finished, we will release all the stems from the project so that everyone in the community can have a go at remixing the track. Our hope is that by working closely with the people on your team and in the rest of the community, you will get to know some producers that you didn't know before, which could possibly spark some awesome new collaborations!

1369763451.0,57,self.edmproduction,1f7mno,Compressor attack time - Explanation,KaazEDM,74,17,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1f7mno/compressor_attack_time_explanation/,"I read the ""there are no stupid questions"" thread and there was a lot about compressor attack times.

Basically the debate was the following: is the attack time how long the compressor takes before it starts compressing, or is it how long the compressor takes to do the 'full' compression (from uncompressed to the desired compressed volume).

Here is the explanation: **IT DEPENDS ON THE COMPRESSOR YOU ARE USING**.

To prove my point, I chose two different compressors in Logic: **MCompressor** (by Melda) and **Silver Compressor** (Logic stock compressor). To be able to capture the dynamic of the sound in one picture, I used the FabFilter Pro-C, which is not compressing anything (ratio 1:1, threshold all the way up just to be sure...).

[THIS](http://imgur.com/eHO8KK3) is the wave I'll be using for the demonstration, it is a pure sinewave with an envelope that just makes it, well, a brick of sound, to ensure that no dynamics come from the sound itself.

First, I'm using the Silver Compressor:

[HERE](http://imgur.com/3njMvWE) is what it looks like with a fast attack time. [HERE](http://imgur.com/f0ffUt6) is what it looks like with a slow attack time.

You can see that the transient stays intact. The only thing that changes is the compression slope.

Now, off to the MCompressor:
[HERE](http://imgur.com/BaV59rr) is the fast attack. [HERE](http://imgur.com/IqLkGVS) is the slow attack.

Here, both the slope and the time the compressor takes to react change with increasing attack.

I also tried with the FabFilter Pro-C (this time, actually using it as a compressor) and it turns out that it barely lets any transient go through uncompressed even with attack times as high as 500ms. All it does is modify the slope.

So here you are:

* The Silver Compressor lets a certain amount of transient through and its attack time allows you to modulate the compression slope. 
* The MCompressor's attack time allows you to modulate both the amount of transient going through AND the compression slope.
* The FabFilter Pro-C barely lets any transient through and its attack time allows you to modulate the compression slope.

In conclusion, there is no 'true' definition of attack time. The difference in action of the attack time between compressors is to me what justifies buying several compressors beyond the fact that they ""color"" your sound to some extent. I hope that kind of clarified the whole 'attack time' theme and please let me know if anything is unclear.

EDIT: new screenshots where both compressors have the same threshold, attack and ratio:

It seems that the go-to packs that I've seen are [Vengeance Essentials](http://refx.com/products/vengeance/samples/) and [Xfer](http://www.loopmasters.com/product/details/236). As for effects, I personally use the ones included in the former, as well as Push Button Bang's [Robostep sample pack.](http://www.loopmasters.com/product/details/1040/Robostep). Rankin Audio also has some sick loops and sample packs from competent artists. I also have a huge collection of sampled sounds from old drum machines called The Machine.

As for VSTs, I use mainly Massive. I make a lot of my own sounds, but I also look at tutorials for other peoples' signature sounds, and then tweak them to make them better and unique.

What sample packs and VSTs do you use?

So here's a list of all the sample packs mentioned thus far:

* Vengeance

* Xfer

* PBB Robostep

* EZ Drummer 

* Superior Drummer

* Thomas Penton Essential Series

",JDPatFig,61,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/1727wo/some_pluck_programming_tips_that_apply_to_other/,"I was working on a couple plucks in Massive a few months back.  I looked at some Youtube videos for ideas and to see how others were tackling them, and I noticed a few things that people tended to overlook: 

1.  The Release:  Obviously the most notable aspect of the pluck is the envelop on the LPF cutoff frequency.  The sound starts brighter and very quickly descends to a slightly duller sound, just like a pluck on a string.  The sound gets brighter as the cutoff frequency is raised when the filter is opened up.  At the same time, many programmers increase the release time on the AMP envelop, so the sound holds out longer as it gets brighter.  To do this, you can set a macro in Massive to control both the cutoff frequency in the filter and the release time in the AMP envelop (which by default is envelop 4). 

2.  The Amount of Filter Drop:  When the sound is in its initial dullest stage, the difference between the attack and the sustain is not great.  But when the sound is in a brighter stage as the filter is opened up, the attack cutoff frequency and the sustain cutoff frequency can be much different (Zedd does this a lot).  To do this, assign the same Macro to the 'level' parameter in the filter envelop.  When the sound gets brighter as you open the filter, the sustain point needs to be lower.  

This all makes sense when you start playing around with these parameters.  Ideally, you can have one macro assigned to something like the mod wheel that will allow you to manually play around with the settings.  When you raise the mod wheel, the sound will get brighter, the release time will increase slightly, and the sound will still drop to a  duller sustain point even if the attack frequency gets very bright.  

Another cool tip:  assign the random parameter (TR next to the macros) to the amount of pitch spread between the voices.  If you're using unison mode, a/k/a multiple voices with panning and pitch spread, then you can assign the random parameter to the pitch spread of the voices.  If you're using multiple oscillators, you can assign the random parameter to the pitch of one of the oscillators and give it a range of 3-5 cents.  This will result in a wider sound in the stereo field, so don't do this if your mix calls for a more-narrow sound.

This thing just saved me so much time and hassle, I figured I'd share it with the community. 

Here's a cool experiment. Take a channel that you have, let's say, a grimy bass on. Now that bass is eating up not only the low end, but interfering with the high end in the drums. Put the rack on that.
Now take another channel (let's say a grouped track of drums) and send it to three new audio channels, and put the audio from the original on sends only. Take the high multiband compressor and put it on the first new track, rename that track drums hi or whatever. Do the same thing for the other two tracks with the other multiband compressors, renaming accordingly. 
Now go to the compressor in the rack on your grimy bass and route the corresponding drum channel to the sidechain for each compressor. Now you can adjust to taste how much you want each eq band to pump.

I really dig this because it's an efficient way to free up certain areas of the spectrum for a split second to let another instrument come through, and it's not as apparent as total sidechain compression. You can use it as either a very subtle mixing tool or an all out dynamic effect.

Open up an instance of your favorite DAW and we'll get started!

**The Key**

This sound is made using a dead-simple FM synthesis recipe. I was lucky enough to recognize the sound at first listen because the formula is really easy to stumble upon through exploration.

**Ingredients**

* An FM synth of any description. FM8, Sytrus and Operator are great, but even something like Oatmeal or Thor that only supports basic FM will work too. Last episode, WELL_GODDAMN_SON and Sachemdot were kind enough to recommend some free FM synths: Oxe FM, FMMF and VOPM.

**Get Cooking**

1. Set carrier to a sinewave at -1 octave. Set modulator to an at-pitch sinewave and turn the FM down until the sound mellows out a bit. Map the FM amount to your mod wheel or to an LFO and further adjust the FM amount and mod amount values until nice clean wubs result.

2. The timbre of the target sound has already been achieved! Let's make it even more wubbly by adding on a low-pass filter. Turn the frequency all the way down and crank the resonance. Map it to the mod wheel or LFO that you set up in the first step, and adjust the mod amount until it jives.

3. We're still missing some minor timbral modifications. What you want to do next is set up another carrier-modulator pair, identical to the first, but one octave higher. Make sure they're not modulating the first pair in any way.

**Polish and Variations**

It's easy to turn this into other, nastier dubstep wobbles. Experimenting with substituting different waveforms in place of the sinewaves can be very rewarding.

A little distortion on the end of the chain can really enhance the character of the sound. A vintage tube can emphasize the garage flavor; a convoluted Ohmicide preset could be appropriate for neuro effects.

Try some stereo separation. A cheap-sounding spring reverb can create heavy space around the sound. Or try a touch of chorus to make it leap out of the mix — perfect for complextro-style one-shot wubs.

1357269066.0,59,self.edmproduction,15xfpo,Synth Recipe 9: Vintage Bass,mark-henry,66,7,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/15xfpo/synth_recipe_9_vintage_bass/,"Today we'll be making [a vintage house bass as in ""Head of House"" by Glenn Underground](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNbxZpdWIuA#t=30s), as requested by snupicel. This is a nice beginner-level sound whose vintage flavor serves as an excellent base for many other sounds. Open up a blank project in your favorite DAW and we'll get started!

**The Key**

This is the characteristic sound of a vintage analog synth. This bass could have been made by any vintage synth you could name: it's just a simple waveform put through a resonant low-pass filter. As the filter envelope decays, the filter makes that classic bow bow noise.

This is very similar to Synth Recipe 3: Progressive-House Pluck. The difference is that it's monophonic, the filter settings are different, and the filter envelope is quite a bit slower.

**Ingredients**

* An analog synth

**Get Cooking**

1. Set the synth to a saw wave and transpose -1 octave. Set the decay to about a second and the sustain to -10 dB.

2. Activate a low pass filter and its envelope. The decay should be at about two to three seconds. Set the resonance (sometimes labeled ""Q"") fairly high and slide the frequency down until the sound gets nice and dark. Envelope amount, filter frequency, and decay length — expect to have to jigger with these three settings for a bit until you get to the target sound.

**Polish and Variations**

A little tube distortion (I got good results with [BootEQmkII by Variety of Sound](http://varietyofsound.wordpress.com/downloads/)) really complements the vintage feel of this sound. Keep it tasteful.

Or don't. Turn the filter resonance all the way up, grab a saturator and overdrive the sound into a harsh mess. Play fast arpeggios with it and you have instant Chemical Brothers acid bass. Tighten the volume and filter decays down to almost nothing and ping pong delay it for a sick stabby background texture.

If you find a middle ground in the distortion department and turn the filter envelope down, you can play low beefy bass notes. Funky.

If you're into vintage deep house stuff, look [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAbLiJAGp_8) for more inspiration. There are two or three sounds in this track that are derived from more or less the same formula.

We can instead do an EDM song with everyone submitting stems and someone mixing it all together. We can vote for the tempo/genre or just do a big mashup. We can post the song to itunes and then give all proceeds to a charity of the communities choosing, possibly something that helps to fund music education. 

Who is interested?

**Edit:** skylink gave a great idea, instead of working on just one song we can split into teams and work on different songs of different genres and put together an EP instead. 

**Edit 2:** I think the consensus is moving towards an EP. From the comments, it seems we should include a Moombah track, Electro-House, and Liquid DnB. If anyone is willing to do another genre please  post.

I'll private message everyone who comments on this thread to see the level of interest and work out logistics. I think a shared dropbox system will be ideal and we can use google docs to share contact information. Each song can have a captain who is in charge of the song and will work with collaborators to produce it. We should have an overall project manager to make sure the songs get done and to oversee the whole project. What say you?

**EDIT 4:** Ok, I think an EP consisting of 6 songs will work. Each song will have up to 5 collaborators and will elect a team captain to oversee the song. I will oversee the whole project and make sure the songs get done. I tried my best to match everyone with a song based on what they stated, this is a rough guideline for the 6 songs, if anyone wants to change one of the songs to another genre or something, let me know. If you want to work on a specific song and there's an opening, please private message me, otherwise I'll try and place people by what they posted in the comments. Although some of the genres are similar, this will allow the teams to express different sides of each genre.

**Also, if you are going to work on a project, please pm me your email (preferably gmail). I will be creating a central document on google docs to handle logistics and hold everyone's contact info. I will be sending out an invite to a shared dropbox folder but I only have 2gb of space.**

**Edit 5:** Each Team will choose their own team leader who will be put in charge of overseeing the project. The team leader will create a dropbox for the team to use. Each team will have their own dropbox so that there isn't clutter or too much space is used. I am creating a spreadsheet to upload onto google docs that will give everyone's email and what they are doing. I also need people who like to mix and master in case any of the teams needs someone to do so. PM your email if you would like to mix or master.



**Edit 6:** The teams are now set, I just need everyone's email who are on teams by tomorrow night so I can compile the email addresses and create the google doc. Everyone go ahead and message your team members and decide on a team leader. I'll work directly with the team leaders to establish deadlines and a schedule. I'm really excited about this and hope everyone else is too. Let's make this a really great EP.

**Edit 7:** I would really love to have more genres but as of now, 6 is enough for the EP and with 30 collaborators, it is going to be a lot of work to make sure this gets done.

Common Questions:

- **When can I submit my track?** Track submissions will start once you accept my invite to the shared Google Drive folder called ""EDMP Compilation Submissions"", sent out to you after registration closes, and voting ends Sunday night.

- **When does voting on the tracks start?** As of right now, the last day to TURN IN tracks will be April 1st. After that date, they will either be sent to mastering or to the third party judge. If a majority wants a public judging session on Plug.dj or soundcloud, that will probably happen before the 3rd party judge ranks them (while we're waiting on mastering). Unless we decide to have everyone master their own track, the 3rd party judge will not start judging until all the tracks are mastered, hopefully, second week in April. To be fair to everyone, the 3rd party judge should rank the mastered tracks only. Please add [mastered] or [pre-master] to the end of your file depending on what you decide to do.

- **Can I post my submission to any other sites during the competition?** Yes you can, as long as you aren't charging for downloads or signing up for distribution through a label or a company. If you want to try and have your track signed AFTER the album is released (and your track in the top 15-20), please inform me before it goes live on other stores, and I'll have to remove it from the compilation.

- **Are there any restrictions on genre?** No, as long as it's in the dance genres listed as options for the /r/EDMP flair bot.

- **How can I share my work in progress submission with other subredditors?** Once the shared folder is created and you've accepted my invite to join it, you will have access to the reference of the folder on the Google Group to browse whenever you want. Feel free to upload WIP's to get feedback or collaborate. If you upload stems (for collab), please make your own folder. The folder will be locked when the clock strikes midnight and it becomes April 2nd. If you have multiple tracks in the folder, delete them before then, and make sure you have the right VERSION of your track in the folder before then. If the rule vote decides that we're going to do both new and old releases as separate albums, there will be two shared folders.

- **If I don't leave enough headroom in my mix (-6 - 8 dB) or if I realized I screwed something up in the mix after April 1st, can I fix it?** No. Your track must be completely ready to go by April 1st. If you need help with either of those things, please use the group or post to the subreddit BEFORE the deadline.

- **What if we don't find an engineer to volunteer and everyone submits unmastered tracks?** 
If we can't find a volunteer after the next two weeks, we will discuss this further, (possibly requiring everyone to master their own tracks). We could split up the work, if need be, between the most experienced / willing members of the sub reddit. If that proves to be too time consuming, the judging will start with the pre-masters, with exceptions made for mastering-based problems, and then the top ranked songs will be gathered and sent to a volunteer, or I'll attempt to do it myself(lolz). **If we do find a volunteer soon, and you finish your track early, please let me know, and I will send it to him early.**

I was just thinking once again about the amazing talent here and my appreciation of that talent.
I consider how fortunate I am to live during this time and experience all that's possible. 
I am driven to evangelize, to you and to others, about our fantastic opportunities and wealth of experience that's possible today.  
Why does this matter to me? Why should this matter to anyone?  

Some of you guys and girls are among the best electronic artists out there. Whether you know it or not. Whether or not you are doing this as a hobby, professionally, or whatever your goals may be. 
You may not know it. You may not think it. You may not believe it.   

Hold on, who the hell is Leechifer to know what the hell he's talking about? 

Oh hell, here he goes again, about how he had to trudge uphill both ways to and from the studio. 
You don't think? Take a minute and read it. It's an interesting story if you like ancient history in Internet years.  
Experience counts. You know it does. 

So, I'll be 45 this year. I started sound, lights and video production while I was in high school. Between 27 and 28 years ago. I attended a private prep school with a huge drama department &amp; theater, and a video production studio with professional equipment. 
I did on-location and in-house sound and video production with pro gear back in the 80's. All that gear was analog. All of it. Digital pretty much wasn't ""there"" yet. That's some perspective and experience, IMO. After I graduated high school, in college I did tons of music recording. 
Tons of it. I was in Athens, GA, and Atlanta at the prime of the punk era and the beginning of the indie era. I recorded live bands and lots of electronic &amp; industrial performers in clubs like the 40 Watt, The Point, 688, the Metroplex, the Cotton Club, the Uptown Lounge, etc. 
Did light &amp; sound work too, in some of the venues and ones not on that list that were small and had friendly house engineers. I can't even remember all the different mixers I've worked with.  
Part of this missive it to impart that now is an amazing time for all of you. (Yeah, yeah, you keep telling us that...)

I recorded my own music. At the time it was influenced by Skinny Puppy, Bauhaus, Einsturzende Neubauten, the Cocteau Twins, the Butthole Surfers, and so forth. 

I did live sound, lights, and video for punk bands, industrial artists, experimental, electronic pop, dance, ska, and rock &amp; indie artists. Between giving all the masters and studio recordings to the artists I'm kicking myself at how I have almost none of it now.  

I was a PC guy. So I had the program called Cakewalk to do MIDI work. It ran on the MS-DOS operating system, originally. Dude...DOS. A monochrome display for the first version of the program. NO digital audio in the DAW--it didn't really exist as a open market thing yet, when I started. The gear to produce CD masters was so expensive it was totally out of reach. 
 
I worked with a Fostex 4-track, with two-track reel-to-reel tape, and later on with DAT. When I recorded live sound it was with a couple of SM57 mics, a SM58, a couple of PZM mic's, and whatever sends or sub-mix I could get from the house board. I built up my own studio and am fortunate that I had (comparatively) a lot of money for a college kid. 
In my studio as I built it up I had a Korg DDD-5 drum machine (12 bit resolution!), a Korg DW-8000 keyboard, a [Korg DSM-1 sampler](http://www.vintagesynth.com/korg/dss1.php), an Alesis Midiverb 3, a little Yamaha reverb unit, a MIDI patch bay, a Sony DAT recorder, a timecode interface, eventually a Mackie 1604 mixer, and a ton of hand-me-down guitar effects pedals like a RAT distortion pedal, etc. 

OK so what?  Well the outputs of all these is *analog*, other than the DAT. The card(s) available to get digital audio into the computer were *really* expensive. It took some expensive computer parts to even get a system that could record audio at 16 bit &amp; 44.1 mhz. If we wanted. 
 
When we first got audio editing software for Windows, you couldn't do effects in real-time! You had to render it and then see how it sounded on playback. Sync'ing sound with video used timecode and for much of the gear that chewed up one of your analog tracks--the pro gear had a dedicated timecode track to ""stripe"". Now things render and mix in real time!!! Tons of tracks!!!
I'm from the dark ages. Yet I still had an amazing, powerful studio and instruments. Later on I got a Kurzweil K2000 which is one of the best fucking synths/samplers ever made, hands down. I've had all manner of DAW software through the years, had Fruity Loops when that's what it was called. Had Sonar, Have Sound Forge, ACID Pro, FL Studio, a bunch of other random audio programs, and now I've just picked up Ableton and Reaper. Year by year there's more and more out there and it's amazing. 
I'm not mentioning all this to brag. Tons of my experience isn't even with edm and edm production. I just want to give you an idea of all the stuff I've worked with and how it's influenced me, and what's different--and what's the same between you all and me--and then &amp; now. 

When I look at what I have now, it's like being in some sort of futuristic heaven. Anything I'd want to do is possible. Anything. It's the most fucking amazing thing about music creation and audio production. This is an astounding time to be alive and be someone who creates and records music. *Appreciate it*. Use it.

One thing after all these years that I realize now is that I'm a far better sound engineer for *other people's music*. Years of output prove that. For my own, I don't have patience and don't spend enough time and practice. One of the *big* mistakes I made in the past was working while under the influence. Personal disasters lost so much gear, source material, tracks, mixed or not. I haven't had a drink in 5+ years and that's the best decision I've ever made.  

I've known what I'm doing and yet have made bad decisions and wound up in a situation where pretty much anything I've done for someone else is better than for myself. That's OK if I'm OK with it. 
You hear the saying, ""those that can't do, teach."" I feel like that much of the time. A Bob Marley quote is oddly relevant: ""it's intuition; them knew it, but them can't do it."" 
For my own music, I didn't have patience, I didn't take enough time with my work, I didn't stay sober while working on it, and I didn't focus. Well I'm going to now. At least more than I did. I don't have the free time I once had, but I've got a whole new set of gear. Again I'm fortunate that I made some good life decisions and money is essentially no object.
But this isn't some ""wah, poor me BS"". This is amazing. If I want to, nothing is stopping me. I post my stuff under another alias to separate the artistic stuff from all the day-to-day redditing. Some of ya know who I am. It doesn't matter.  

You say, again, ""so what?""

OK, my beautiful creative compatriots: Do it. Play it. Record it. Make it better ... don't give up. Keep at it. If you want to, go for it and keep going for it. Nothing is stopping you. Whether you think you can, or think you can't--you're right either way. Be right that you can do it!
This stuff I hear from you guys is so inspiring and rewarding emotionally and artistically. Back then, we didn't have the content and connectivity on the Internet. We didn't have the Web. We didn't have the amazing ability to share, to collaborate, to learn, to distribute or *sell* if we wanted that, which you do now. You have a universe available that I urge you again and again. 

And I want to throw out there that I'd love to mix, re-mix, or take a stab at mastering some of your work. PM me. This week is not great for getting started, as I'll be working an IT project in Minnesota for a defense contractor.

* First, we were hoping that this wouldn't become a problem, but apparently we're getting popular enough that there have been plugs for people's own businesses/software/etc. This will no longer be tolerated. Most of you don't need to worry about this, but if we have any reason to believe you have anything to gain financially from any submission, comment or thread, we will remove it. Repeated offenses will be dealt with harshly. Cut the bullshit--this is not even remotely the place for it.

**REDACTED BY POPULAR OPINION**

~~* Second, and this is going to have a more noticeable effect, we've decided to do away with gear threads. There is gads, oodles, butt-loads, and metric shit-tons of information on the internet about which gear you should buy for your purpose, at your budget. There's a link on the side-bar that is so damn good, everyone should read it. It's the [Newbie's guide to EVERYTHING](http://www.dubstepforum.com/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=159713), and among many, many other things, it has information about hardware. Basically, there is no need to have repeated hardware threads that yield the same responses. If you need specific information about how to program a launchpad, or that kind of thing, that's ok.~~

I hope you all can continue to recognize the importance of setting limitations on the content. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

**Edit** We've realized that apparently we had it wrong. Obviously, our ideas about the the gear threads are different than the community's, and so after careful consideration, we've decided to cancel the no gear thread policy. 

We strive to listen to our community and heed their calls when we are making changes that the majority disagrees with. We do not aim to fall by the wayside, and the quickest way to do that would be to ignore you guys when you're all speaking out against things we're doing.

1350174128.0,52,self.edmproduction,11fs68,Synth Recipe 5: Rolling Electro Bass,mark-henry,61,9,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/11fs68/synth_recipe_5_rolling_electro_bass/,"Today we’ll be making [the effervescent bass from ""Sunset Boulevard"" by Paul Keeley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyQAMR0Y_No#t=79s). Open up a blank project in your favorite DAW and let’s get started.

Two MIDI loops today: [intro](http://www.mediafire.com/?f9koc8d850awu2r) and [main](http://www.mediafire.com/?njdz2syug01lozk).

**The Key**

A bass isn't all about bass tones. The most intense basses derive their energy from filling the frequency spectrum almost entirely.

This bass is, at its core, essentially a saw wave. It gets its uniquely powerful character from distortion, equalization, and mixing.

Its ""rolling"" quality has a lot more to do with the notes being played than you'd think. Paul Keeley makes this bassline exceedingly funky by playing with short vs. long notes and making skilled use of funky syncopations.

**Ingredients**

You will need:

* A saw wave or something similar. (See [Recipe 2](http://redd.it/109wrb) for tips on creating your own saw-like waveform)

* Distortion and distortion and distortion. Definitely include a tube saturator in your selection.

* EQ

**Get Cooking**

1. The saw wave should have only enough attack and release to prevent popping. For bonus bass, layer a sinewave with the saw wave. Same octave; we're just emphasizing the fundamental. Transpose the whole synth -1 octave. As with pretty much all bass instruments, you should set the polyphony to 1. For this bass, also turn on glide/portamento and dial it in somewhere between 150-200ms.

2. EQ with a lowpass in the midrange. Don't worry; we'll get the top end of our spectrum back in the next step.

3. Distortion! I’ll take this opportunity to tell you guys about one of my favorite compressor plugins, [RoughRider by Audio Damage](http://www.audiodamage.com/downloads/product.php?pid=ADF002). It has a very unique sound and I use it for distortion whenever I want a warm and indelicate sound. (Quote from the user guide: ""We left off the actual time values, so you're gonna have to use your ears, like the he-men did it in times of myth."")

4. More distortion, what the hey. There’s nothing better than several stacked distortion effects, each of them subtle. Don't forget the tube distortion. I spent a lot of time with Ableton’s Dynamic Tube effect, tweaking the parameters around and exploring the sonic possibilities.

4. Now slap a final ""mixing"" EQ onto the end of the chain. Get the bass energy under control, then scoop out the mids. Don’t worry too much about it until you start mixing your tune.

6. Tweak the distortion and EQ (especially that first lowpass) until you get something that sounds nice. Keeley’s bassline strikes an excellent balance between the low and the high frequencies. It’s not too muddy, not too bright — super warm.

**That’s About It**

Once it’s time to mix your track, it should be a matter of tweaking your final EQ instance and maybe adding a bit of multiband compression for extra oomph and aah.

Also, put a final highpass on the chain and slowly sweep it down during the intro.

**Sidechain and Serve**

Any questions? What sound would you like to hear in upcoming episodes?

**So to help your fellow EDM producers out, if you could hold off on any new submissions that would be sick. I'll try and do another thread some other time.**

**This thread is a bit too busy now for me to see what I did and did not reply to...so If you have submitted your track on the thread here or the old thread from a couple of days ago and I haven't managed to get to you, could you please submit them into here:**

Hey everyone, As mentioned a couple of days ago ..I will be critiquing your tracks for mixdown and production tips.

**Quick background on who I am**
Some of your remember a post I made a few weeks ago, but for those who don't, I'm a longtime redditor and I am also a producer from Australia as part of a duo called The Only. We are signed to Ministry of Sound and in addition to producing chart topping tracks here and doing 100+ gigs every year, I also do mixdowns for a lot of projects.

**Why am I doing this?**
I strongly believe that by helping others, you solidify your own knowledge and also learn things along the way. 

I also wished for some kind of help like this when I was starting out and will always appreciate the few people who did help me along the way and I'm just passing the torch.


**How this is gonna work**

I posted a thread two days ago in which I provided a URL for people to submit tracks to me. 

A lot of people also posted their music in that thread. If you are one of those people, don't worry I didn't miss your tracks, I will check them all.

If you have not already submitted your track via the other thread or my submission page, it's not too late and you can post upto two tracks on this thread or go to this link:

https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=00970c24db6044f5982f3ec92796cea1

So what I will do is reply to this thread and I'll reference your username like this: [/u/neonstereo!](http://reddit.com/u/neonstereo) and give you the feedback/critique!

If it takes me some time to get to your track, don't stress because I may have to give my ears a rest or deal with life stuff throughout the day.

P.s. as a bonus, here's an album of pictures of my cat after he got given the /r/photoshopbattles treatment http://imgur.com/a/Mmppc#0



Someone PM'ed me the other day and asked me how they can thank me for doing this. If you like you can grab a copy of our new single on beatport via here: http://btprt.dj/1bB1Dcm or just simply pass the good will onto someone else who needs a helping hand when the time comes and you're in my position :)

After a bit of tweaking and trying my best to get something good, I ended up with an EQ, a compressor, and an adaptive limiter (in that order) on the summing bus and I bounced out the result. 

I then brought my new sample back in to the DAW (same session) to listen to it again and because I like to look at the new waveform. When I hit play I noticed that it sounded different than before the bounce and I realized that I forgot to bypass the plugins on the summing bus so it basically got resampled. Although it sounded different I thought it sounded a lot better in my opinion, I noticed that it got more punch to it. 
Then I bounced that sample and did the process again out of curiosity and ended with an even more punchy kick than the last. 

It turned out to be a complete accident, but I am super happy with the results. This might be common sense to others, but the fact that I discovered this on my own without hearing or reading about it made me feel accomplished. Incase this isn't already something you guys do, I thought I might as well share it with my fellow knob twisters.  

The only bad thing I noticed though was that there was artifacts that became more apparent after each bounce (in total I bounced it 3 times) especially in the tail, but it wasn't enough (personally) to ruin it and you can just cut it out anyway. 

If you want I could put the samples up on my soundcloud in bounced order so you guys can here the differences.

So I guess the problem here is that a lot of intermediate producers want vocalists on their songs and a lot of intermediate vocalists want to find producers for their own songs and/or do features for EDM producers. Unfortunately, their isn't a neutral place to connect the vocalists to the producers (or at least I haven't found a place)

To solve this I am thinking about creating a website where both vocalists and producers can come to network and connect.

Each person would be categorized as either a vocalist or producer and have their own profile where it includes samples of their music and they can private message each other or exchange information to eventually collaborate.

**TL;DR: A website where producers and vocalists find each other to collaborate.**

So I feel it's important to provide some insight into the community traffic, so that you can get an idea about how much we've improved and to get excited for the future, because a lot of these numbers are pretty exciting.

Reddit has its own statistical analysis that is provided for the mods only--I think this is because Reddit probably has to produce the statistics every time you request them, which takes a lot of processing power. I've also done some of my own statistical analysis on the Feedback thread's traffic. As you'll see, the statistics all show great things for this community.

**First the Subreddit's Stats**

Just an quick note:

* Uniques are unique people--by IP. So you're only counted as one unique no matter how many times you visit in that time period. 

* Impressions are page views.

[Traffic By Hour](http://i.imgur.com/P2JlC.png)

Either our producers like to stay up late and sleep through the day, or nobody visits r/edmp at work. I like to think a bit of both ;) Note, though: we are peaking at about 175 unique visitors per hour each day.

[Traffic by Day](http://i.imgur.com/Asys4.png)

What I find most impressive about this is we are averaging 1500 unique visitors per day, with an average number of page views per person of approximately 3-5. We also see a slight increase over the last month in both the uniques and impressions. We peak at about 8,000 page views in one day. That's great. 

[Traffic by Month](http://i.imgur.com/JsI1S.png)

2012 has been a fantastic year for us so far! For god only knows what reason, the turn of the calendar turned a page in our popularity, and each month has been skyrocketing! We're only about 75% of the way through March, and we've almost surpassed February. 25,000 unique visitors last month--only 1/5 of those are subscribers--140,000 pageviews. This is truly exciting news. 

[Subscribers Per Day](http://i.imgur.com/5Xhme.png)

Over the last month, we're averaging about 30 new subscribers every day! Holy cow. You guys have been getting the word out in a huge way, and I can't wait to see what all this new talent has in store for our future.

**Feedback Thread Statistics**

I've done some of my own data analysis for the Feedback thread. It, too, has been making great improvements!

[Feedback Thread Statistics](http://i.imgur.com/AN83x.png)

Ok so the left side of the graph deals with the bars, the right side with the lines. The dates are by when the thread was posted. The total height of the bars is the total number of root comments posted to the feedback threads. The green portion indicates the number of those posts that didn't get any replies, which means the blue portion are the people who did. One thing you can definitely notice is a strong increase in popularity of the threads over time. We've almost tripled the number of people coming to these things. There's another trend that's difficult to see, but that will come in another graph later.

The red line indicates the average number of children for each root comment including ones with 0 children. I'd say there is definitely a slight increasing trend in this, which means that there is more people making comments on others. The pink line indicates the average amount of discussion taking place on the comments that actually have any replies. This seems to have relatively no momentum in either direction.

[Zero Reply Percentage](http://i.imgur.com/UkHTT.png)

This graph plots the percentage of root comments that have zero replies. Without a doubt, we notice a trend down, which means more and more people are receiving feedback in every feedback thread. This is very exciting news. Even with a sharp increase in the number of people requesting feedback, we are seeing a large percentage increase in the number of people receiving it. That means this community is growing in a big, important way. We'd love to see an even higher percentage of people receiving feedback, so definitely pay attention to those threads! I think with the new schedule of posting feedback threads whenever they die, this trend will continue to improve.

Personally, I'm really excited. I hope that providing you all this insight has given you a boost of motivation and maybe even inspiration (hopefully not perspiration =P). I love this community, and I love seeing the huge improvements being made.

So, I'm wondering what your opinions are on which producers have some of the best technical production skills? Also, are there any elements you can point to that a layperson would be able to understand and pick up on? Are there any producers that you feel have excellent melody/creative talents but lack production skills? (I'm sure the opposite is abundant).

1362057137.0,49,self.edmproduction,19e6pj,Critiquing lyrics in EDM; is there even such thing as narrative in dance?,Nidis,78,29,110,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/19e6pj/critiquing_lyrics_in_edm_is_there_even_such_thing/,"[jjjeahh raised a really interesting point](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/19b562/if_you_could_give_one_piece_of_advice_youve/c8mnxqf) in the *""If you could give one piece of advice...""* thread and after typing up a pretty lengthy response, I felt it might just be better to give it its own discussion room because its a big topic and it isn't often spoken about. Basically, one of his points of advice for new producers was ""every track needs a story."" When asked what he meant, an example he gave was *Language* by Porter Robinson and how it sent shivers down his spine when he first heard it. It's a brilliant song musically and I'm not trying to be controversial so please hear me out before getting any pitchforks, I'm well aware I might be very wrong about this.

I don't want to come across like I'm ripping on his point or anything because I actually really love it and do agree with it personally, but I found the story of Language to actually be atypical of a larger problem within EDM and as such a bad example of good storytelling. The music and title itself speaks *lengths* to me about how theres this kind of ambivalence that comes with talking and how fruitless it can be sometimes when *""no words are ever enough""* to describe a situation, a problem or a feeling. But when the actual lyrics of the song come in, a beautiful soaring cacophony of atypical literary mush flies out of the speakers; which means all that meaning was just me projecting my thoughts, really. Terms like ""waves of space and time"" and ""floating"" just scream *""I'm catering to people who are rolling""* and come across as almost kind of cringe-worthy to the sober. Maybe there's an aspect of the narrative I'm missing but the actual indeterminate nature of language, as the name suggests the song is about, is barely even alluded to. This approach to EDM lyric and story-writing ultimately dogs the culture at large, I fear, in the same way LSD and *feelin' groovy* did to counter-culture in the 60s and 70s; it becomes a parody of itself. I'm not ripping on people who roll either but there's no way some of these lyrics or themes stand up on their own accord.

There's a lot left to the imagination in EDM themes and lyrics and I'm sorely aware of how much people like to assimilate and project their own feelings into the media they enjoy. EDM comes across to me kinda like 'fill in the blanks' in terms of themes and ideology, it pretty much lives off of the personal associations people want to make. It's unique in being able to do that, in the same way an almost blank canvas is unique because it can later become a painting. Its impossible to quantify to what extent it is actually happens, but I fear tracks with nigh-on no intelligent narrative whatsoever like [Kyoto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86khmc6y1yE) by Skrillex permeate the scene as a result. It's not that the music is bad, it's that the song says... nothing, really. I get the feeling this is because, kinda like jazz, the audience is there arguably for the instrumentation and not a vocalist. Of course this isn't always the case, there are brilliant examples of EDM lyrics telling a legitimate story like [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ll5ykbAumD4) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Di5AT4MI6BY), but it's hardly common. How much of a place do well-thought out lyrics and narratives *really* have in EDM? I'd hate to say probably not nearly enough.

I didn't start on electronic music, I grew up on punk and weird alternative rock like Deftones and hip hop and I really feel like EDM (as much as I genuinely love it and live it as of several years ago) doesn't really stack up when it comes to a lot of the songs having an identity outside of the fact that they simply don't sound like any other song. It's kinda hard to go from [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omf8nFt1cCA) to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js8Qg32sBjE), in terms of lyric writing.

I think this is taking jjjeahh's comment way beyond its original point, I don't want to speak for him but I think he just meant the song in question has to at *least* have some consistent sonic identity. It shouldn't just be a fun faceless bunch of chords or riffs with a fun-sounding name, [even though some of my favourite EDM tracks are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2CHvbvNZII).

Change time signatures for the extra bar!",djsunkid,59,12,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/19d6vc/i_just_figured_out_how_to_make_ableton_let_you/,"Have you ever noticed that Ableton subtely discourages adding extra bars to your track?  Like, if you want to add an extra bar before the drop, for example, you can totally do it, but it messes up the measures grid for the rest of the track afterwards.  You zoom out and want to move stuff around, but your clips don't line up to the grid anymore because of that extra bar in the middle or whatever?   

Well, it was something that was kind of annoying to me, since I don't always change stuff ONLY on the 4, 8, 16, 32, etc...  So anyway, I just had this flash of insight on how to trick ableton to making the grid restart one bar later.  You make it think that one bar is actually 4 bars, by changing the time signature of that bar to 1/4.  Then when the beat drops again, switch it back to 4/4 and VOILA!  Zoom out, and notice how the zoomed out grid starts with your drop, not just before your drop?  And everything else lines up too?  

Oh I'm pleased as punch about this.  Is this a known thing, or am I as smart as I think I am?

EDIT:  OK, a few things to add.  First of all, adding 1/4 bars is definitely not the best way to go about this.  Instead, make the bar before the the ""extra"" into a time signature with however many extra beats you want to add.  In my case, I want to add 4 extra beats, so I make the last bar before the extra bar into 8/4.  

Also, I realized that I'm having a hard time describing what I mean, so I took some screenshots to illustrate my point.  http://imgur.com/a/9DsJa Imgur was being weird, hence the doubled images at the end of the gallery, but yeah, this slideshow should make what I mean super clear.  Thanks again to /u/krypton86 for showing me the better way to do this.

Here's the idea outlined:

- People producing similar genres are pooled together.

- Those people in those pools are then divided into groups of 3 or 4, randomly, irregardless of skill level.

- It is then up to each of these groups to agree on a form of communication. email, PM, dropbox, whatever.

- The group communicate with each other, sharing ideas, critiquing each others work, even collab, **it's completely up to them** what they do.

I'll just give an example of when this worked. Porter Robinson and Madeon communicated a lot in their early days,  and look at them now. DISCLAIMER: This does not mean you'll become Porter Robinson or Madeon. You'll be much better. 

- But there's already a feedback thread says you. Of course there is, but it has limitations, especially with timing and no one answering your comment. This is much more focused and you're much more likely to get  valuable feedback. (Obviously continue using the feedback thread though)

If there's interest, I can set up a submission thread and do the sorting.

I had gone to a bar a few towns over, and met the DJ. I didn't talk to him much because he was busy DJing and I didn't want to bother him, but then last night he was just drinking at a different local bar and we got to talking. He expressed interest in my songs, and gave me his card and wanted to play my songs in his set this Saturday, and have my stuff to play in his sets in the future.

His sets aren't 100% in line with my style though, so he'd be remixing my Dubstep songs into a House set basically, which would work at times (When I heard him he was mixing in Dubstep and Hip Hop a lot), but it got me thinking. From what I've heard from feedback threads and such, there are some pretty good songs coming from this community that I'd love to be able to give him and any other local DJs I can network with.

So I was thinking, we should set up a Soundcloud group to share tracks that we feel are ready for the dance floor. Then, we can each browse the submitted tracks and then at our own discretion, give it to DJs we know for them to play if we like the track.

If you don't want your songs to be downloadable, but still want other producers from here to be able to send them to DJs, then if someone sees a song they want to share, they could privately message the person and ask them to drop it in their box so they could send it to their DJ however they want to. And, of course, if you *are* a DJ and you're here, you can just get it yourself

I've already gone ahead ahead and created an [/r/edmproduction Soundcloud group](http://soundcloud.com/groups/r-edmproduction), so if you like the idea, go ahead and join the group and share your best tracks. If people like this idea, hopefully we can get a link in the sidebar.

 [genre competition #1 info](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/w57gw/redmproduction_genre_competition_1/)

  Hey everybody! We're back with genre competition #2. This genre was invented by our previous winner, [rvdh](https://soundcloud.com/thefever). 

  **Your mission is to create a track in the following genre. Interpret these directions however you wish, and create a song that fulfills your vision of this genre. You may use any sound sources you desire in this competition.**

  Genre: Bunk (sometimes referred to in full as 'Bodyfunk')

  Tempo: 105 - 115 bpm

  Time signature: 4/4

  Instrumentation: Punchy kicks &amp; snappy gated-reverb snares, warm staccato synth bass and unconventional percussion sounds. Cleverly-placed short silences are often used as a rhythmic instrument. Regularly makes use of electronic-era funk samples to get that funk-aesthetic.

  Characteristics: Often dubbed the most badass of all EDM-styles, the T-Rex of electronica, the nemesis of Dubstep. If the latter was born out of ganja-infused Reggea jams, the former is born out of the cocaine-fueled, Western equivalent of that era: Electro Funk. Bunk gains it's weight and heaviness not from cliché distortion, aggressive chainsaw bass or heart-attack kicks but rather from the unprecedented fierce swing grooves it bestows upon it's listeners…and also the snare.
Bunk is ALL about the head-nod. Head-nodding is to Bunk what head-banging is to Grunge. Driven by a smashing, hyper-quantized four-to-the-flour beat and shimmering hi-hats.
Punchy kicks on the downbeat and aggressive 80's-style gated-reverb snares on the upbeat provide rhythm to syncopated basslines, groovy percussion, pitched tom-roll-breaks and unexpected melodic elements. Surprise micro-silences are used as exclamation points to the incredible flow of this music.

  Keywords: Flow, in-your-face, Groove with a capital 'G', highly danceable and crisp production (lo-fi has no place in this genre).

  Producer's checklist:

  Overall funk-aesthetic

  Four-To-The-Floor beat

  80's-style gated-reverb snare

  Rhythmic micro-silences

  Syncopated instrumentation

  Unconventional percussion sounds.

*No Reggaeton 'Dem Bow'-style beats, so no syncopated snares or claps. In Bunk the only place for snares is the upbeat.*



  **After you've finished your track, upload it to soundcloud as a private track and send the secret link in a PM to [myself](http://reddit.com/u/Doomsaloto) or [DinosaurHospital](http://reddit.com/u/DinosaurHospital). Please have all entries in by Friday, August 10th.**

Would anyone be interested in participating in a monthly/bimonthly sample pack challenge? 

Stealing the idea from dubstepforum, but basically everyone would download a user supplied sample pack. The only rule is you can only use what's in the pack. No synths or extra samples whatsoever. You can eq, chop, stretch, mangle the shit out of, and toss them back in a sampler if you want. Any kind of processing is fine &amp; no genre restrictions, but absolutely no other samples can be used. Winners would be voted on by the community with the winner supplying the next sample pack.


I've taken part in a few things like this and it's a really fun and challenging way to produce music. Sometimes the packs are super limited and the samples can be really random. The limitations actually seem to fuel creativity &amp; experimentation since you're out of your usual samples/synths comfort zone. Also, I think it would be really cool to see what reddit could churn out since there's people of all skill levels here.

This post is not about what a mastering engineer does but more about as a producer, what it is like to work with mastering engineer. I recently got a track mastered by /u/David_Rodriguez (the same guy who mastered the first edmp compilation) and I thought this community could benefit from a walkthrough through (at least his) process for mastering a track.


In the first email between us David gave me login information to a FTP server where I should put my mixdown and also where he would put the drafts/final master. After that it was simply a conversation of what I wanted the final track to sound like, even asking for a track that I liked to use as a potential reference.


From that time on the process became pretty simple. I'd wait for David to complete a new draft of the master, give my criticisms, and repeat until I was satisfied. In the end it took 3 drafts before coming to the final master.


As a final contribution to this post I'd like to link to both the mixdown I sent to David, and the final released master for you guys to actually listen to the difference. (Note that the mixdown is inherently much quieter than the master so you might need to turn it up)

[The original mixdown](https://soundcloud.com/biz-caus/fight-me-pre-master/s-Fxiov)

[The final track](https://soundcloud.com/biz-caus/fight-me-original-mix)

Now you'll notice that my final song isn't perfect but that's because of issues with the mixdown and not the master. It's important to realize that a good master cannot fix a bad mixdown.

This synth, which I called The Golden Ratios since it's made primarily of Operator's Operators, works by stacking sine waves on top of each other at different octaves and then distorting them. Each knob describes what it does in it's info text, but I will tell you that opening the default patch, hitting a C0, and cranking the ""Space"" knob will give you a great indication of what this synth can do with it's sine waves.

That's not all though. While I made this to be a bass synthesizer, turning down the distortion and playing some higher notes can create some great pads or percussive sounds.

So have at it! Turn some knobs! If you like what I made, I have more effects and synths that I wouldn't mind sharing!

[flairbot's back up](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/wirnb/update_on_the_flairbot/)

---

We have that whole nifty flairbot guy who's been feeling sick for some time now. he's written in python 2. Unfortunately I cannot give out the source code because it's not mine and the person who wrote it made me promise never to hand it out. He also hasn't been around in a while.

He managed to convince /r/furry to give us their flairbot's source. The problem is it's written in Python 3. Our programmer didn't know Python 3 and was too busy with his own stuff to learn it to adapt theirs to our needs. 

So that's where you, unnamed programmer, comes in. The flairbot DOES NOT have to be written in Python. If you'd like to try to plug in /r/furry's flairbot into our needs, you're welcome to, but you're also welcome to write it in C or whatever. We do, however, have a few specifications that you need to meet.

* The flairbot must use the [Reddit API](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API)

* We need to be able to specify the username/password that signs into the flairbot. When it signs in, it should check its mail and flair everybody who's sent it a message.

* The flairbot should check its mail periodically. The time period should be easily changed via some sort of terminal command, even if it's a command line argument when the program is started. 

* The flairbot must be able to recognize soundcloud links. I believe our programmer used a regex that recognized ""soundcloud.com/"" and grabbed that and everything after it until it found white space. Ignore http:// and www. to make it short. This needs to be placed in the text portion of the flair when the request is sent to reddit.

* The flairbot must be able to recognize genres. This should be done with a string to string map. The 'key' being strings we find in the message and the 'value' being the name of the flair class. So for instance, ""dnb"" maps to ""dnb"", ""drum and bass"" maps to ""dnb"", ""d&amp;b"" maps to ""dnb"", etc. These should be case-insensitive. Our CSS flair classes are called, for instance, sc-dnb. So, the value of this map should be specified in the 'class' portion of the flair as ""sc-""+value. We can talk more about our flair class names once you begin.

* The flairbot should message a user when it's successfully flaired someone, as well as when it couldn't find a soundcloud link.

* If the computer the flairbot is running on looses internet, the flairbot should periodically check the internet connection until it's reconnected, at which time it signs back in and checks its mail.

Again, this does not have to be written in any particular language. You can write it in assembly if you're a masochist. The most reliable way to apply for this would be to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fedmproduction) so we can all see it.",,False,,t5_2sa4x,1342216334.0,,sc,True,t3_wi7pp,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/wi7pp/looking_for_a_programmer_to_fix_our_flairbot/,moderator

(or at least wouldve taken me a substantial amount more time to gain)

I honestly just wanted to get a better idea of the kind of ppl that frequent here on a more personal basis.

I'm always surprised by the variety of producers of all genres and walks of life that post here. From big names to people with tremendous knowledge/experience to amateurs like myself that are hungry to learn.

I'll start. I'm from Philadelphia, 22 years old and have been a musician for the past 10 years. I used to play in bands (guitar and piano). I've been through many music phases and wrote/played everything from jazz to super technical progressive metal to RnB.

I've been producing for the past 6-7 months mainly prog/funk/electro house after being inspired by the ""edm"" scene as I used to go to big shows/raves A. LOT (pretty much never now)

I'd be lying if I said I didn't want to ""make it"" but I'd be content with even marginal success as I couldn't see myself being truly happy doing anything else. 

I graduated college recently and holding a crappy part time job as I'm still struggling to improve my mixing/find my own sound and actually finish full songs more consistently to eventually break into the scene.

Edit: Heres 2 of tracks im working on if anyones interested. My soundcloud is really just full of privates as I wanna things to be competent and complete before I start regularly publicly uploading/

Mind you, I only did this because the last thing I want to do with my life right now is study for finals, so it's a bit of a rough attempt, but I think the thirty minutes I had to spend on it definitely got it in the right direction. (Zippyshare's processing of the wav file for streaming also blends the higher frequencies and makes it sounds like there's a phaser on the bassline channel.)

All of the effects units I used were Logic native except two ([Bad Buss, a decent free waveshaper](http://www.stillwellaudio.com/?page_id=19) and [LFOTool, probably my most used plugin](http://www.xferrecords.com/products/lfo-tool)). I linked you to both.

Since I'm really not a proponent of the ""copy my patch setting for setting"" aspect of the Youtube tutorial culture (it doesn't teach you nearly as much as experimentation and thought process do), I won't give you the exact numerical settings I used but instead I'll tell you why and how I used the techniques I did to inspire you to use them in fitting places in the future. For those that want the numbers, links to the project file and patches are at the bottom.

Finally, before I get into it, there's one technique you should get in the habit doing of before you work with distortion/effect-intensive sound design like this: put an EQ in between every distortion plug in. Distortion reacts to and produces harmonics in your sound heavily. Putting an EQ between your distortions will not only allow you to separate the sound you want from those weird ""ghost"" pitches that appear when you apply distortion, but allow you to experiment with how overloading the distortion unit with specific harmonics changes the sound. 

Now, the key thing to picking apart and realizing sounds that you hear in these fully-fledged songs is understanding that they more than likely were not made in a single Massive patch as, again, most Youtube tutorials lead you to believe. So if you listen to the sound in the song, you can clearly hear that there are two elements: a darker, distorted bassline in mostly mono and a brighter supersaw in mostly stereo. I tackled the latter top end first.
 
The top end is a distinctly wide, crispy supersaw, so I made put together a quick one in Sylenth. You can hear that it's crispy rather than soft in the high end, which occurs when you use less voices and less detuning among them. For this one, I had two saws with three voices each and the detune setting set just below half (just enough that the [beat frequency](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/sound/beat.html) was low enough to be unnoticeable) with stereo all the way up. For the sake of complexity and added thickness, I set the detune setting a bit higher and the volume a bit lower on one of the oscillators. Then, I applied a soft Decimator to give it the high-end ring and a bit of chorus to smooth it out with a low enough ""wet"" setting to keep the crispiness of the unprocessed sound. I knew that I'd apply distortion to the sound, but I wanted it to have similar settings to the other sound (the one the distortion would really define) for the sake of cohesiveness so I cut the lows and left it there for now.

Then, for the lower sound, I copied that supersaw patch, set the stereo settings to zero, and experimented with different waveforms in different octaves to get the heavier bassline. When making basslines, remember that the initial texture of the sound relied not only on your waveforms but the relationships between them--for example, a square an octave lower than a saw will give you different phase alignment and different texture than a saw an octave lower than a square. In this case, I stumbled upon using one of the three-voice supersaws with a raw square an octave below it. I set the volumes so that it sounded as much like the real thing as possible, then I got to processing. I cut out the sub and high (Above ~10kish, just to get rid of the sheen) frequencies, and applied a waveshaper. I messed with the settings on 100% Wet and put a boost onto the EQ going into the waveshaper between 100 and 200Hz to overload it in those frequencies a bit, then I took the wet down to about 25%. This took the sound from lighter and thick to heavier and more solidified. I EQd it further to make it sound as much like like the real thing as possible and applied a bitcrusher with 4x downsampling (that setting has a really nice ring) and some drive to thicken the sound out a bit and add some thick higher harmonics. The wetness setting on this was about 20%. I used a directional mixer to take it down to 60% mono, and that part of the sound was done.

I then copied the waveshaper and bitcrusher settings to the top end and bussed them together. I made copies of the track for each individual wobble and stab. On the buss, I did some group light EQing to bring out similar elements from the two parts (low mids, highs) and did some mid-to-heavy compression on the buss (2.5:1, 20dB) to bring the harmonics to a closer level (Theoretically, it just changes the volume, but when the compression is that heavy it allows the quieter harmonics to shine through a bit), ""gelling"" the sound in other words. LFOTool for the sidechain, and the sound was done.

One note: a lot of the ""beef"" of the loop on a whole comes from the long tail of the kick. I just sampled the kick and snare from the original song.

For those of you that are interested in the exact settings and have LFOTool and Logic, I uploaded the project file [here](http://www41.zippyshare.com/v/24602654/file.html). Here are the [Waveshaper settings I used for those that can decipher them](http://imgur.com/rPoLz) and the two Sylenth patches are [here](http://www25.zippyshare.com/v/23862588/file.html) and [here](http://www25.zippyshare.com/v/35380599/file.html).

The problem is that the room is only active hours after a thread is made about it, then it's dead. So the solution would be to make official times.

My suggestion (for maximum leniency) would be **Sat/Wed, 8pm/2am (GMT+0:00)**.

Those times would be:

* Sat/Wed - 12pm PST, 3pm EST, 8pm GMT (in London).
* Sat/Wed - 6pm PST, 9pm EST, 2am GMT (in London).

That way, there's a time for our U.S. friends and our U.K. friends. Although the times aren't that important as people generally hang out for a while. So if you can't make it to a certain time, don't fret, just pop in sometime around a suggested time and I'm sure they'll be people.

If anyone has any other suggestions, comment and upvote the ones you like, and hopefully we can get an official time side-bar'd.

THESE SONGS ARE COPYRIGHTED. If you'd like to remix it, go ahead as long as you put my name in as the original artist! I encourage it, actually. But to release it as your own will get you in a world of hurt! (/intimidation) Sorry about that, I just have to be clear - you can't trust everyone. My aim here is to help you guys, not to get screwed by a bad apple in the group.

Check out my other lessons!

* [Lesson 2 - Melody](http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/v9a58/lesson_2_melody_level_beginner_to_some_experience/)

So for this lesson I orginally wanted to just show you guys what goes into making a good trance lead but that's a completely varied topic. As in, that would take many posts to do and I'm not sure if I'm up for that...yet. If there's a ridiculously large amount of interest I'll do it but I don't want to ""waste"" my time going through different kinds of leads and what you can do to make your own. Instead, I believe I've honed in on a very important part of trance: the pluck. I hear shitty plucks ALL THE TIME. Almost every VST you have will have a bad pluck preset. Don't use it. Please. This lesson is hopefully going to get you to say the same by the end.

My example song has different plucks so I think it's perfect in this case. If you're curious what VST I'm using, it's V-Station. I highly recommend you get it if you're serious about producing trance. I used it for my bassline tutorial and I'll be using it again as V-Station is great for its bass, leads and plucks. 

The first example I'm going with is the more drawn-out pluck. 

****

There's a few things you should know before getting your hands ""dirty."" 

* Keep plucks short. The longer you stretch it, the worse it will [probably] sound. But then there's too short. We'll get into that as well.

* Use your delay FX. The delays your VST comes with are great but for that real nice pluck effect I suggest you also use the Fruity Delay 2 or Delay Bank. (You can use it instead of the VST's, I do both depending on the situation.) The Delay Bank is more difficult to learn for beginners so keep it simple with the Delay 2. Don't ask me what settings to use for the delay, you should play around with it and see what you like. Remember, this is your music you're making, not mine.

* When making the VST, make sure you have a decent melody playing to get the real feel of the sound. Otherwise, you may overdo it and have to spend more time getting the sound you originally wanted.

Now, let's move onto the actual pluck. When I say ""drawn-out"" I mean that when it's played you get a more full effect. Other plucks will stay crisp. Others roll (which you can sort of cheat with a bad arp). And then there's others but for today's lesson I'm just going over the longer and the shorter plucks. 

To get started, make sure you at least know what the abbreviations on your VST are (if you're not using V-Station). Otherwise, this will be a bit difficult to understand while reading. I'm talking about OSC1, OSC2, Freq, Detune, Mod Env, Release, etc. Those are random words, yes, but that's for the beginners out there who don't know what those mean. This tutorial is not for you. There's great tutorials on r/edm for that, I'm sure.

To make it easier to understand, I made this short video of how I quickly make a pluck sound. **[Youtube](http://youtu.be/IVO4psqn0S0)** 

You can notice quite a few things here - what knobs I actually use and don't. The important two things when first making it is the frequency cutoff and the mod envelope in the filter section. The mod envelope essentially is how hard or soft you want your pluck to hit (in this case). The freq cutoff is how short or long you want the pluck to play. There's other factors in play here but after I first make the synth those two knobs are the ones I tweak the most to get the exact feel I'm wanting. 

****

The other pluck I'm going to discuss here is short plucks. There is a such thing as **too short** and it's ultimately up to your own taste. There's always room for exploring but if you make your plucks too short it can ruin your whole song (other things can do this as well, plucks are a big deal to me). 

What differs from the pluck above is hw you want to approach it. It's not just the synth you make but the notes as well. I've already said you should have your pluck melody (or what you originally want as your pluck melody) in the VST before you make it. If you can't envision it before you make the sound I suggest you use a preset. Sure, it's not going to make the final cut of the song but it can provide a reference point until you get your personalized sound in. 

Specifically to the synth itself, make the pluck's attack harder and don't have it release as much. In short, keep off of the sustain and release to keep the pluck from giving too much sound. Here's what my VST looks like for my short synth. [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/7WBmU.png) - [mp3](http://www.mediafire.com/?o4qd2xs317ihtqp)

****

To wrap this up, plucks are one of the many things that can make or break a track so I hope this lesson will help you immensely. 

Now you've (hopefully) read three lessons. What would you like next? The next two topics I have in mind are **organizing your tracks** and **EQing your track (for beginners).** If you've got a suggestion, let me know! I'd love to read your thoughts on this. And if you've got something to correct me on, please do so politely. I'm here to help producers who are starting out, not to argue on the internet about what I do right or wrong.

I've heard I'm supposed to lead ~3-6 db of headroom to give the mastering process space to eq and adjust dynamics / loudness.  Currently I'm running a limiter on my master set to -0.3 db and it is compressing the final signal a bit. 

My question is this:  To achieve some headroom for mastering, should I  adjust each track volume down or can I simply reduce the master volume by 3 db?

I like my mix how it is so I'd like to stay away from readjusting each track, but maybe I should've thought of this earlier and it would be worth it so start over?  How would the premaster be affected if I reduced the gain pre vs post limiter?

Thanks!

EDIT:  Other premaster related questions.

Should I be EQing, adding reverb, multiband compressing etc my master track to taste before mastering?  I always do in the production stage to better hear what the track would sound like, but maybe i'm doubling down with my mastering process unnecessarily.

I'm part of the duo, Zulu Company, we make electro and progressive house (let's not argue) and haven't been on the scene too long but we're getting our sound out there, recently released out first track, ""The Red Room"", on the (amazing) Adrenalin Room Records.  (link below) We do some DJing here and there but production is our primary focus.  We've decided that we wanted to reach out to all you internet-ers out there and instead of just spamming our music and asking for Likes, we want to give back to the online communities that have helped us develop over the years.  This sub is top on that list.  

I wanted to do our tutorials a bit differently than the ones we have come across out there.  First and foremost, these are going to be long.  There, I said it.  If you prefer short videos with no talking and quick cuts to the end result, this will NOT be a tutorial for you.  The first episode clocked in right at an hour, and though it's split into 3 parts, future episodes will hopefully be tighter but still EXTREMELY thorough.  The purpose of these videos is to show every step of the process, not just gleam through edits at mach speed to arrive at a result that leaves the view rewinding ad nauseam.  

Secondly, I wanted to find a compelling way to structure these tutorials. What I decided is to make each episode specific to a certain sound.  Not a specific example from a specific track kind of thing, but more of the genres of sounds that are identifiable by commercial dance music (think, super saw, growl bass, trance pluck, etc) but to explore these sounds THROUGH PRESETS.  You read that correctly.  I am going to use actual presets that I've have gathered over the years and am fond of to explore a way to use the sound we are referencing.  I will analyze the preset, deconstruct and reconstruct it and then build an idea around it. The idea is to show how you can learn from presets, not to depend on them, but to use them to learn both synthesis and the particular synths you are using.  I'm going to only use the most popular synths out there so hopefully you'll have a copy of it (Sylenth, Massive, maybe Zebra, FM8 or Ace) and the rest will be Ableton 8 native effects.  Any sounds/sampels/presets used will be included in the pack, however with modifications made (eq, comp, fx) so as not to be directly giving away purchased presets, which is illegal.  SHAME on you….the very idea!

Okay.  I know that was insanely and maybe unnecessarily long winded, but I just wanted to get that out there for anybody who wouldn't be into the videos based on this description so you don't have to waste your time watching em.  I will included the final loop in the intro of each video so you can judge for yourself whether you're interested in watching! PLEASE leave feedback, commentary, criticism, likes, dislikes, hatemail….any criticism is welcome, as are requests for future videos.  I want these to be helpful more than I want a Facebook like (you will have to like our page to get the download pack, bwuahahaha) so please let me know how future videos can be improved! And if you reeeeeally don't want to watch an hour long video, I won't think less of ya, you can still grab the download pack with samples, midi and the preset!

1349524210.0,40,self.edmproduction,111ebs,Submitting demos; Do's and Dont's!,demoshredder2000,47,7,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/111ebs/submitting_demos_dos_and_donts/,"Recently I have gotten the assignment of keeping track of the demo inbox for a pretty big EDM label (along with other members of our team). We get between 30 to 40 demos send to us each day, and guess what, 99.9% is shit. I've been doing this for a week now and have yet to find a song strong enough to present it to our 'boss'. 


So, because I've got love for this subreddit and because I need a place to rant, here are some tips. I know some may look obvious, but I'll put em down anyway for good measure...


1. When submitting to multiple labels, please send each label a separate email, or at least use BCC. We get several submissions with 10 other labels in the 'to' field, this makes it come across as spamming and does not make me feel special...


2. The title of your email. Try making your submission look as professional as possible, so no 'bigggg deemmooo!!!', no 'MUST HEAR HUGE TRACK!!!' or '15 YEAR OLD PRODUCER'. A title like 'Artist name - Track name' usually works best.


3. Send whole, finished tracks. We will never release your 'Preview', your 'Unmastered Version' or your 'Unfinished please send feedback'. I actually can't believe I'm typing this, but you'd be amazed by the amount of 1m34 tracks we get.


4. Send 1 song. Send your best song, if it's really good and we're blown away we will ask for more. If the 1st one I hear isn't amazing I will not check out the other 4. By sending 1 song you show confidence, that it's a high quality product you believe will make us want to sign you.


5. This one goes especially for the electro/dance/edm style that's the most popular at the moment. Don't let this stop you from experimenting, but there's a reason most song structures follow kind of the same line. We want the DJ's to play the tracks, so there's a 1 minute intro and a 1 minute outro, between those there are usually 2 drops, and it should all happen in about 5 minutes time. Now once again, there are exceptions, think 'Karmameter' and 'Metropolis', but if your song has 6 different parts and lasts 8min, it has to be really really impressive, and usually that's not the case, sorry...


6. Mastering is important, even if it just means putting an L2 on the master channel to push everything to 0db. This might sound stupid, but after going through 40 demos a day, I've noticed the ones that don't 'look' mastered usually sound amateurish. And by 'it doesn't look mastered' I mean when I open the soundcloud page and your song's wave form looks like it's malnourished.


7. This is where it's no longer a matter of not acting retarded and giving your email a normal title, this is where you have to distinguish yourself creatively. What are labels looking for? The general answer would be; Something special. When you receive so much demos each day, so much people producing EDM, so much people looking to get their record out, you get to be real picky. Compare your sound to your favorite artists, A-B the shit out of your song, it needs to be as good as the current #1 on beatport. It's hard to really give advice here, some people just have it and others don't. Some people need to practice for 10 years and others become successful after 1 year of producing. Aside from that, you need to be really critical of your work, if you're in doubt then you're probably not there yet.



That's everything I can think of for now, I hope I don't come across too much as a dick. I've been on the other side as well, submitting demos etc, but now that I know what it's like to receive so much music on a daily basis, I understand why labels can come across as assholes. The amount of emails is almost like they're spamming us, now that wouldn't be bad if the quality was there, but it's like 90% of the people make their first song in Magix Music Maker and send it to us for feedback... So yeah, after a day of going through poop you become a bit of an asshole.

This basic guide might help.",daveshow07,42,1,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/s2h44/thinking_your_track_is_missing_something_this/,"I have made a [graphic](http://i.imgur.com/oZct0.jpg) to help explain the basic concept of adding dimension to sound, which I know is something easily overlooked when producing. If your sound is there but sounds flat, adjusting a combination of the following parameters might help.

*The graphic illustrates what the following describes* 

Picture hearing sound in a box that encloses your head. That box is a song, and within that song are different instruments whose sound can originate from all points inside the box. 

By balancing combinations of the levels of volume, pan direction, reverb and/or delay - wet or dry, and pitch/equalizer freq, you can effectively ""place"" instruments into particular regions of the box. First, I will explain what each parameter does:

**Volume** - Raising the volume of a track within a song production (an instrument if you prefer) can bring the sound to prominence. Basically, turning the volume up results in that instrument dominating the space (in the box) in which it is placed. Conversely, reducing the volume of the track can reduce the prominence of the instrument in the mix. 

**Pan** - The pan is simply the balance of the volume of the sound between two stereo speakers. Move the slider 100% L and the sound only comes from the left speaker; 100% R will result in the sound coming only form the right speaker. 

**Reverb/Delay** - Reverb provides the feeling of space. The size and character of the reverb (long fading or slow fading release) can essentially create the dimensions of the box. A longer fading reverb will make the box space seem bigger, and shorter fading releases make the space seem smaller. Delay is essentially more of an echo type effect, where the initial sound bounces around in the space. A short delay (where the sound echoes soon after the original) provides the feeling of a smaller space, and a long delay (where the sound echoes long after the original) provides the feeling of a larger space. The Dimension Expander effect in Massive is more or less a short delay.

**Pitch/EQ Freq.** - This parameter is of some debate but most speaker setups will have lower frequency speakers down low and high frequency speakers at the top. At a club, the subs will likely be on the floor and the tops will be on stage or up on the ceiling; or on your home studio monitors, a sub (if you use one) is generally on the floor, and the tweeters are generally on the top-side of the linear reference monitor on your desktop (unless you are one of those people who likes to turn them sideways).

Regardless, adjusting these standard parameters (along with some EQing to make space, I can explain if necessary) will go a long way in making your track feel as though it has what I like to call ""dimension"". If I close my eyes when I listen to music (particularly with headphones), I somehow almost always envision some sort of space wrapped around me, almost like a small or large room, where the sound of each of the instruments has its own place in the space. Different genres of music have different styles of using the space but nonetheless, there is a space created. If you keep this in mind when you are working on a song, it will make a world of difference.",,False,,t5_2sa4x,False,,sc-harddance,True,t3_s2h44,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/s2h44/thinking_your_track_is_missing_something_this/,

I messaged the mods, and they said to start writing it myself or make a thread for it. I don't have nearly as much knowledge on the subject to write any part, so I come to you!

If you think you know a genre inside out, help other users out and write up some things about it! (Or comment to help others provide information you think others should include.) I think we should be mainly focusing on two things:

* Genre Characteristics 

* Songs that almost perfectly exemplify the genre

  Sorry about the delay, we had some issues. Some things to think about when scoring an entry:

  * How well does it fit the Nu-Melowfe description?
  * Is the track well produced?
  * How creative is the track?
  
  Genre:
  
  Name: Nu-Melowfe

  BPM: 150 - 165
  
  Time Signature: Commonly 4/4, some in 6/8.

  Characteristics: Known for its erratic pitched percussion, melancholy synth leads, and warm fuzzy atmospheres. Often makes use of samples from folk music.

Tracks are scored from 0 - 9, with 0 being completely awful and 9 being absolutely amazing.

  After voting concludes, a winner will be announced, and the second round should begin shortly after. The winner will be allowed to choose the next rounds genre and will have their name featured in the header next to the name of the sample pack competition winner.

A few weeks ago someone [requested a music production class](http://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityofReddit/comments/n5x3g/request_music_production_classes/) on [/r/UniversityofReddit](/r/UniversityofReddit), so I decided to make it happen.

The plan is to build a curriculum around a set of screencasted lessons I'll be recording over the coming weeks and months. These lessons will be in 1080p and freely available forever on the Youtubez. They will start with the very basics of audio production -- like the fundamentals of synthesis -- and progress on to more advanced topics like tool use (with a focus on Ableton Live), sound design, composition and orchestration, the use of EQ and compression and other effects, mixing, and mastering.

Here's where I need your help in answering a couple questions that will help me build the best curriculum for you:

1. What topics are of the most interest to you? Which topics do you struggle with or wish you could better understand? What do you most want to learn?
2. How would you classify your general level of competency? ""I just installed a DAW and I'm SO EXCITE!"", ""I know how to open a synthesizer and browse plugins"", ""I started a few tracks but don't know where to go with them"", and so on.

My goal is to create and build upon a solid foundation of applicable theory to help you understand both the ""how"" and the ""*why*"" of electronic music production -- and to give you a lot of quick wins along the way -- to help you learn and progress as artists.

I'm currently working on the first lesson, ""Building A Sound"", that covers the fundamentals of audio synthesis. I'll do my best to show that seemingly daunting topics like additive synthesis and Fourier analysis are not only both intuitive and easy to learn; they're also fundamental to the art of electronic dance music production. I'll show you how to use additive and subtractive synthesis to do practical things like create a plucked string sound, a warm pad, or a totally sweet reece bassline.

Here's [a screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Hd8J4.jpg) of me building the all-mighty saw wave using additive synthesis to give you guys some idea of what to expect from the screencasts.

To give you an idea of my credibility as an edm producer, [here's a preview of a track called Scourge (yay Starcraft) on my upcoming EP](http://soundcloud.com/all-your-bass/scourge-preview).

I've seen so many different ways to do mix. I'm wondering what people do here. 

I'm frustrated by a few things in my own mixes. In a lot of my favorite music, I hear this incredible sheen on the high frequencies - there's just this silvery atmosphere I can't seem to recreate. Examples: [Bondax](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU639WhxTIs), [Fat Jon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEqi8enwnvw), [FlyLo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diIDRIyFgC0), and [Stimming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36lkHXYs4aY). And [Sorrow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOFXDU9lxXU&amp;feature=plcp), for good measure. Is there a word for this shimmer? Is it just boosted hi frequencies, or is there a processing element to it? Has anyone had any success creating this kind of atmosphere?

Second thing - many of these tracks have this immersive quality to them. Examples: Again, [flying lotus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GW1NTN5vMyY&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PLBDF152BBDA789B00&amp;feature=results_video), [The Cinematic Orchestra](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwjmMcN1WtU). Granted, I am wearing headphones, which contributes to the experience. But especially with the FlyLo track, I feel like I'm just swimming in bass - how is that achieved?

and last. Power. Punch. Not just in the kick, but in the synths as well. How? Example: [Deadmau5 cover of Boards of Canada](http://soundcloud.com/fuckmylife/boards-of-cadanada-roybgiv-deadmau5-cover), [EDX](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-i2gZXtNDo), and [Mord Fustang](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGgBWghFgZQ).

I'm curious what r/edmp's thoughts are on this. I like using white noise under filters as a top to a sweep (or the sweep itself), or with no attack and a short decay to add some bite to my claps.

Do you guys use white noise? Do you hate that hissing sound some producers use? Let us hear your thoughts, and perhaps people can elaborate on some techniques they've discovered to use this massive range of frequencies

Tools: Native Instrument's Massive  
  
1. Start with a simple saw oscillator, one octave up. (Or alternatively, just play the patch at F#4 and leave the saw the native octave).  
2. Filter 1 is daft. Cut off at full, and resonance at ~15%.  
3. FX1 is reverb, default settings, with dry/wet at ~20%  
4. FX2 is dimension expander,  default settings, with dry/wet at ~20%.
5. Under voicing, set unisono to 2. Turn on pitch cutoff and move the slider until the first large notch is visible. Turn on Pan Position, all the way to the right.

I mentioned in the last thread that Reddit silently changed their HTTP request maximum frequency. What I didn't realize at the time is that they heavily throttled the default User-Agents for python (and I'm assuming among other things). This was something like ""python 2.6"" or whatever. If you don't set your own user-agent, it defaults to the python's (if you're writing your bot in python like we did). So once I asked /r/redditdev about it and got some help, I've now added my own User-Agent and voila!

The Flairbot is now running at 100%. Your flair should be set on average in about 3-5 minutes (he checks his mail every 5 minutes). I wanted to make a concise thread that explained to people how to use it who don't know how.

You can add 'flair' next to your name. For this subreddit, it's essentially a little soundcloud icon with a url to your soundcloud page and/or your primary genre. The soundcloud url will be hidden until you hover over the flair.

To do this, [Message SCFlairBot](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SCFlairBot) with a link to your soundcloud page and/or any values from the following table.

You will receive a confirmation reply when your flair is set.** If you do not receive one within 20 minutes, feel free to message the moderators.

To remove your flair, message SCFlairBot with the body of the message simply, ""unflair"". 

If you have tried to set your flair in the last day or two and it has not been set yet, message Flairbot again. 

In the future, I will see about him automatically updating the sidebar with his on-line status.

I've played rock, metal, jazz, indie, country, classical and about everything else you can do on a guitar and a trumpet in all sorts of venues and settings. I've been producing for about a year now and I feel like my electronic music is finally starting to get decent. I really would like to start exploring this new side of my creativity in a live format, but I don't quite understand how to get there.

I have the necessary gear, but I don't see myself as a DJ. I don't listen to dance music and I certainly don't make dance music. My music is more along the lines of trip hop and downtempo stuff. So how would I go about translating myself to a live format? I've been thinking hard on this a lot and I'd like to hear what some of you guys think. Tycho has been an inspiration because he does a similar thing to me, but plays live now with real guitar/bass/drums and triggers samples/synths in addition, so it's more of a band format than a DJ thing.

TL;DR -- How to play electronica live without being a DJ?

You can change the voice settings and stuff, and even export an audio file. It's great for techno and electro, or if you need a robotic vocalist. I'll go over a basic way to get some useful samples.



-Open System Prefs &gt; Dictation &amp; Speech &gt; Text to Speech. Select a voice. There are a ton of voices to choose from. Audition them by hitting ""Play.""

-Open Terminal and type the following command:    say hello -o hello.aiff

-This will render the computer saying the word ""Hello"" in the voice you selected, and output ""hello.aiff"" to your home folder. (There are more command line options which you can research if you'd like)

-Drag into your favorite DAW and enjoy. I like to adjust pitch, timestretch, chop it to hell, and even supplement real vocals to get sort of a cyberpunk-android type of vibe.

**Bass sounding things:**
  
[1]. http://www20.zippyshare.com/v/76636997/file.html Is this a 'moog' bass? Or just chords?


**Arpeggios:**
  
[2]. http://www35.zippyshare.com/v/98665030/file.html - I hear an arp and a very fuzzy sounding lead thing. Is the arp just a basic saw or square? Is that lead called a 'dutch lead'?  

[3]. http://www35.zippyshare.com/v/64459008/file.html - There are two sounds in here, an arp and some bass/chord sounding thing. What are these called?  
  
[4]. Piggy backing off of the last clip, http://www65.zippyshare.com/v/2283600/file.html it sounds like it is using a similair bass and arp. Correct?

[5]. http://www20.zippyshare.com/v/61934034/file.html The arp here, does it have a name? Or just a basic waveform?

**Leads**

[6]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/69452071/file.html The first sound it makes is this big bright, short, opener. I've heard similar sounds used in pads and leads. What is this? Stacked detuned saws?  
  
[7]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/42915820/file.html Similair sounding one-hit.  
  
[8]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/41784779/file.html The really distorted crunchy lead, is this just a basic wave form under tons of distortion and crushing?  
  
[9]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/54653275/file.html I've heard this type of synth in all types of progressive house, a 'dance lead', is this a 'dutch synth'?  
  
[10]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/57517027/file.html The crunchy lead sound, I hear this all over as well, is this a distorted saw/squ?  
  
[11]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/40361172/file.html This lead is gorgeous, does it have a name? It's obvious under a heavy low pass, but I've tried this with a squ/saw/sin/tri and couldn't get anything similair.  
  
[12]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/14769414/file.html The bouncing lead here persists all the way into the drop, any special name?  
  
[13]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/96382743/file.html The pulsing saw thing here, super saw?  
  
[14]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/43144455/file.html sounds very similar to the last  
  
[15]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/41463063/file.html The high-pitched lead here  
  
[16]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/39877280/file.html What makes this synth sound so close to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQtZ0ZsTW8c&amp;t=2m10s they both have some gorgeous movement and voicing, is this formant filters with vibrato?  
  
[17]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/2462059/file.html similar to last, any ideas?  
  
[18]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/94908773/file.html Another pretty lead, sounds like it has a pulse wave in it?  
 
[19]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/48596450/file.html Similar again

[20]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/55433756/file.html I mislabled this one as a pad, it's actually the lead I'm interested in here. Is this just a saw run under a low pass?
  
**Misc**  
  
[21]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/66709710/file.html The reese bass here, I've created a similair one with a bunch of detuned saws and phasing, but can not get it to reach the same movement as this one. The buzzing in it, is it a saw?  
  
[22]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/72519740/file.html The pulsing bass here, is this a super saw?  
  
[23]. http://www7.zippyshare.com/v/69807231/file.html Sounds the same as the last.

I was only ever in one band, really.  I just started an industrial-flavored project with a friend in The Netherlands (I am in California) and we're both a little lost as to how to handle things.  He is a vocalist and musician in his own right, I usually just use samples for vocals, but write all the music myself.  He has Reason, I have Ableton.  I have an ftp set-up, so whatever is necessary file-wise is easy enough, but *any* advice you can give on how this magic can happen easiest would be greatly appreciated.  If you are in a similar, online-only situation, I'd especially like to hear your thoughts and a bit of how things go down for you.  You people lucky enough to be in the same room with each other surely have some useful advice too, though.

Beepbeep, boomboom, y'all.

**EDIT**:  I was trying to keep the question vaguely precise, but since some are answering questions I am not asking, I'll expand a bit.  Dropbox is just a file-sharing service, yes?  Don't need it.  I pay for server space and set up a directory we can both access, via a process known as [ftp](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/FTP.html), an all-but-forgotten arcane magic for sharing files.  Not an issue.

Really, I am more looking for clues to the creative process, a bit of which I see in the comments so far and will address later, thank you.  With the one song we have so far, I not only started it, his part is purely imagination so far.  I have some hardcore master bus processing that I think is going to require the song be finished in my Ableton project, too.  His studio is being remodeled to make room for his latest child, he's weeks away from joining me, so I figured I would use this time to better prepare myself for the project, ask Reddit wtf.

He's not going to use Ableton and I am not going to use Reason, so using the same DAWs is not an option, part of why I am asking.  I started off with Cubase on a 1040ST and Ableton is rather similar in its boxiness, if 10,000 times more powerful.  He started in an actual studio, so he likes stuff to look like he's sitting in one.  Honestly, I wish we could just both go Bitwig for this project (project synching built-in!), but I'm broke as fuck and any money that comes along is gonna get me a Push+upgrade.  Hopefully soon.

Anyway, I hope that clarifies a bit.

**EDIT 2**: I appreciate all the feedback and will take much of this advice, thanks.  I happened to ask the question just before running out of Reddit time for awhile, though.  :/  Got a lot more than a new band in front of me right now, just sayin'.

",bandersong,97,58,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/edmproduction/comments/17vuwl/an_opinion_about_edm_production_tools_used_and/,"As stated in the title, this is my OPINION. Although that alone should not discredit anyone, I feel like people get easily offended when they are criticized, which I will do heavily in the coming text.



The word ""Producer"" in the most modern context:

Why do we use that word? I can honestly describe that word as TOXIC to the music scene. 

There is a clear seperation in the minds of many young artists, especially those whose career lives mainly on the Internet, between themselves (Producers) and people involved in other genres/realms of music making (Musicians).

Now, I'm not advocating that everyone who torrents FL Studio call themselves a Musician, BUT it's a word that is stupid and useless. It leads people to not see themselves as ARTISTS attempting to create something THEIRS. Often, people are content with ""producing"" house, dubstep, trance, whateverfuckinggenre. What does that mean? Sticking to convention many times, repeating things they hear others in the same genre do, maintaining the status quo except with a little ""flavor"" thrown in there. We have the internet literally FLOODED with this generic mainly electronic music because the technology is so accessible. People see a foray into ""production"" as ""musician lite"" (regardless of how flawed a misconception), when in reality ARTISTS should eschew conventional musical boundries when they can. They should GROW the scene and not just ADD to it. 

""But everyone starts out bad... etc."" 

Sure, but if the person starts making music with the intention of reproducing other people's ideas then they might never get to the level of making something truly ORIGINAL.

Remember Burial? Mount Kimbie? Aphex Twin? Flying Lotus?

Those people all took something that did exist, and turned it on its head. Played with genre boundaries. They looked at their music as something that should stand on its own. I have listened to Untrue, Maybes EP, and all of Aphex Twin's albums with my MOTHER who does not under any circumstances listen to EDM as such. Yet, that music could speak to her even being from outside the scene, it could stand on it's own. Could the same be said about the beeps and bops over a 4/4 kick track that you might be producing today? Probably not. 

""most producers don't aspire to just copy""

But they don't aspire to eschew the WHOLE paradigm of music either. OBVIOUSLY music and inspiration come from somewhere. EDM, Garage, Dubstep, House all existed and if you were to classify them, those albums would fit under a genre of sorts. But they CHALLENGED the norms.

I feel often the root cause of this is that we do not see ourselves as ASPIRING MUSICIANS (which we should) rather PRODUCAZ on the internet. 

Fuck that word, fuck copying others. Be your own musician. Forget the internet, forget fame, forget everything, get YOUR OWN MESSAGE, YOUR OWN FEELING OUT THERE.



TL:DR : The word ""producer"" and the label attached to it, hurts creativity in many new ASPIRING MUSICIANS because it makes them think about their music in terms of ""how can i fit it into X genre"". How many people describe their own music by comparing it to other artists? Learn, be creative and break boundaries. There's no point in remaking something someone else already made.


Excuse the typos, etc.

I'm talking about kicks that are so heavy that no other bassline is really needed for the drops.

Examples:

Tony Romera - Pandor http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIgCCO9he6A

Sander Van Doorn - Joyenergizer http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4znGUn85y0

Kenneth G - Bazinga http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHT5sYOb5VE

Rick Mitchells - Sub Zero http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5zXZ4z1cJw

All these kicks have such massive bass, which I don't quite understand how to achieve all on its own. Is it just good use of compression? Every time I try to just make the bass big, I get a muddy sub bass that doesn't have the higher ends that you hear with these kicks. I tried layering up the subbass with another sin wave 1 octave higher and it just made it sound worse. 
Not quite related to the kicks posted above, but with this bass issue, here's another good example of what I mean with the clear higher range on top of the sub: Dillon Francis -Broken Hearts http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NhLoTxbaVo
I got a decent sub bass going but nothing I did would get me those higher ends of the bass that you can easily hear with this track. Is it an issue of creating a good pitch envelope?

Also, all the kicks I posted above seem to have a high frequency snapping kind of sound that seems separate from the bass itself but it gives the kick a good punch and sounds very clean. It's a quick snap in Sander's track, and it almost sounds like white noise with Tony Romera's track. I absolutely have no idea how to achieve this effect lol

If any of you guys can help me out with this I'd be unbelievably grateful, these kicks have been something I've been trying to craft for almost a year now but I've never seen any good tutorials or anything for this.

I've just gotten into music production and one of the aspects I'm having the most trouble with, and which I think is probably the most important part of music composition, is coming up with the main melody of a song. I feel like most edm or electronically produced music in general revolves around building up to a main melody around which the rest of the song is constructed. For example, the ""Avicii anthem"", as some call it, in Levels. 


I'm wondering how you guys go about constructing a melody. I'm sure everyone has very different methods, but every time i come up with one I think I like just screwing around on my piano, I'll go back to it the next day and think it sounds terrible. I think a problem that I am having is I'm trying to make it too complex, being that I was classically trained in piano for a long time, while edm melodies tend to be much simpler.

Thanks to college_loner for the request (and for my first ever reddit gold)!

[Here's a demo of the successive steps I took in moving towards Zedd's bass.](https://soundcloud.com/mark-henry/synth-recipe-8-demo/s-KbY2c) Even the last version is not a perfect imitation. Not only is there necessarily a lot of randomness and tweaking in the design of this sound, in this case it's not guaranteed, nor is it even likely, that Zedd created it with FM synthesis.

Today's recipe is kind of an experiment in a variation on the Synth Recipes formula. You shouldn't expect to duplicate the sound exactly. I'll be giving you a starting point and a bunch of heuristic pointers on what to tweak, but I won't be giving you the usual piece-by-piece deconstruction. I'll be interested to see how this is received.

[Here's a MIDI file of the riff from ""Breakin' A Sweat.""](http://www.mediafire.com/?uw7rfcb9ud7umxc) Now open up your favorite DAW and let's get started.

**The Key**

Sonically speaking, this is a simple bass. The sound is static and unchanging, without modulation or envelopes — it's based on a single waveform with minimal processing. Because it is somewhat vocal and mouthy, I think it's likely that FM synthesis was used to create the basic waveform. That's what we'll be using today.

**Ingredients**

* One FM synth that lets you adjust individual harmonics. Operator and Oatmeal let you do this. [So does Sytrus!](http://i.imgur.com/M0ptO.png) (twice edited)

* RoughRider or a tube saturator. I got good results with RoughRider in combination with iZotope Ozone's harmonic exciter module.

**Get Cooking**

1. Set up your FM synth really simple: one carrier and one modulator. A second modulator will tend to make things a little too fuzzy, and this is a really clean sound. Transpose -2 octaves. Put your distortion modules on the chain as well. The distortion should be very subtle; it will just lend a bit of intensity to the sound.

2. Start by listening to just the carrier. Tweak it until it sounds reasonably close to the finished product. This makes for a good place to start. Now for some exploration.

3. Set the modulator to a rather darker waveform, and set the FM at somewhat less than 100%; we don't want the FM to blow out and make the sound too distorted.

4. Now it's a matter of playing with the following settings: modulator level, the partials of the carrier and the modulator, and maybe the tuning of the modulator. (Don't forget to revisit your distortion effect every so often. Another setting that will yield interesting results: set the modulator level to track the key, making lower notes brighter than higher ones or vice versa.) FM is an unbelievably finicky beast, and small changes will make a large difference in the timbre of the sound output. But try to make small, controlled changes and you'll start to see patterns.
 1. Keep an eye on the waveform shape as you mess with the partials. Sometimes drastic changes in the partials will result in very little change in the waveform shape and the sound.
 3. As you turn on more and more partials, the sound will develop into messier and harsher timbres as the FM drives and distorts the carrier. For this sound, keep the modulator focused on a narrow, low band of partials, with a couple of subtle high harmonics for flavor.
 2. Turning up an isolated band of partials in the modulator will make a distinct vocalish-resonant kind of sound.

5. **Every time you arrive at a sound that makes you say ""hey, that sounds pretty cool,"" save it.** Duplicate the track and mute the duplicate, then continue working. This will leave a handy trail of breadcrumbs as you traverse the space of all possible FM configurations. Keep iterating like this until you feel you're done.

**Garnish**

The most important thing to get done now is to deeply sidechain to a punchy kick drum. A little EQing will finish the job.

Different types and quantities of distortion will do wonderful things to this sound. Other things to try include modulating the FM amount or putting decay on the modulator, which creates an interesting organic character.

This bass is just begging to be resampled. Whether you’re familiar with the resampling process or you need an excuse to play with it for the first time, there's a lot to gain from putting a few resampling iterations on this bass.

**Serve Directly To The Forehead**

With that in mind I set out to create a simple web platform for doing just that called Muserik that I think r/edmproduction would be interested in. The site is a cross between music and social networking, essentially a ""Twitter for music"", and we recently launched http://www.muserik.com into a private beta for music makers to come and upload their songs before we open up to public users.  

If you are interested in getting in on the ground floor of this new social music service you can register for an invitation [here](http://www.muserik.com), or PM me your email. The benefits of being an early beta tester include 1) No song upload limit, 2) Your music will be part of the initial site content when we launch publicly and some of the first stuff users listen to, and 3) You directly help shape the site as it grows. 

We are hoping to make Muserik a great resource for music makers to gain exposure, build a following, and connect people with your music.

[The results are better than i could imagine](http://soundcloud.com/arka-9/i-feel-right-demo) 

In that example, there are 3 *completely dry*, separately recorded vocal tracks, recorded with a cheap $70 samson mic that i use for djing. The only effects so far are compression, panning for the chorus parts, and i had to chop and move a few parts to make them closer in sync. 

Im sure everyone has their own methods for recording and processing vocals, but i think i am going to run with this for the time being.

I like my chord progressions, lead lines, bass lines, transitions, and even the beats that I come up with, but the drum tracks themselves are just plain awful.  I create the basic beat using Ableton Impulse (usually the backbeat room patch), and I've tried using impulse to create better sounds, but nothing comes close to what I hear on tracks that I like to listen to.

Examples:  on the upbeats, many prog house tracks have that sssssshhhhh sound before the crack of the snare.  Also, the hand claps and finger snaps sound so full.   My high hats are very consistent and unnatural sounding (not being able to get the good opening/closing sound of a natural drummer).  

Really, I am looking for any direction at this point, because any sound will be better than what I have right now.

Since then, we have established a warm and welcoming community on IRC, have hosted genre nights and have had plenty of DJs play some really great shows. But now we're taking things to the next level, and that is why we're renaming and rebranding as **bside.fm**.

The fact is, it became clear that we were not just about out EDM, but about any great music in general. We've had jazz, funk, soul, hip-hop, disco and anything else you could think of on the station up until now, and whilst we still definitely enjoy our electronic music, why would we decide to limit the amount of awesome music we can play?

If you're a listener, we're sure you'll find something that you'll enjoy; be it a great piece of music that you've never heard before - or just the comforting sounds of our excellent radio presenters voices as you sink in to your armchair.

If you're a DJ, sign up on our website and come mix. Beginners are welcome, our only rule is you have to really love your music and we ask that you have a mic to really make the shows 'live'. Please include a link to a social network with recent mixes up, just so we can make sure you're somewhat competent.
We have music running all night brought to you by some of our station's more regular DJs and admins, so do join us and meet the crew in the live chat on the website.

Maybe I'll even make a decent track someday, and maybe I'll get lucky and it'll be actually catchy and listenable.

Like many other hopefuls, I'm just some guy. I don't have the time or resources to be 'involved' in a 'local music scene' (despite living a little more than an hour from Detroit; being married and working full time kinda kills that), so it's not like I'm dripping with connections.

I have some good friends that I've met over forums over the years, but those of them that are signed to labels and such are active in genres other than what I produce, so that's not much help.

So, that puts me in the unenviable-but-all-too-common position of 'barely talented dude that would really like it if people listened to his shit sometimes'. This means that if I don't send out promos to labels / blogs / DJs that I admire, there is absolutely zero chance of anyone else finding my music.

Ever.

And really, I'm not okay with that. I do enjoy music, I love the creation process - putting a track together and watching it assemble itself before my eyes, there's nothing in the world like that. But I'd really like it if people listened to my shit, god damnit! It's not wrong to want that.

So - how does one craft a promo email without sounding like a douche? I mean, these guys are probably CONSTANTLY BOMBARDED with promo emails. They are working musicians with little time to spend listening to shitty music by unknown people. Every time I send out a promo message - hell, every time I even bother to ask anyone to listen to my stuff - I feel really guilty, like I'm wasting their time. Is there a way around this?

get yourself some of those glass beads that you often find used in vases for flower arrangements.   (They need to be flat(ish) on one side and round on the other.

Here are the final results:

Track submission page:

* http://soundcloud.com/themonthlysample/sets/sample-pack-competition

I recommend you upload your track to your own Soundcloud page now as I will eventually have to remove all those tracks to make space for next months submissions.

I hope you guys enjoyed this first months competition. Dante will be making the sample pack for next months competition and we hope to have that available during the first week of next month.

This being the first sample pack competition we've run, we learned a few things that will help us make changes to allow next months competition to run smoother. A few of these changes will include:

* tracks will only be submitted as mp3's, max bitrate of 320kbps. i'm not sure why I wanted everyone to submit their tracks as lossless in the first place.

It's come to mine, outlawchesus', and dontworryimadoctor's attentions there have been posts made that weren't intended for this subreddit. Please be reminded, this community is specifically for discussing the process of EDM production. Please observe the following etiquette when taking part in this community:

* This deserves its own bullet point: This is community is about HELPING others progress their productions and improve their production skills. This ideal is absolutely paramount to this subreddit. A give and take is to be expected.

* Check your arrogance at the door.

* ONLY post songs that are a work in progress (WIP).

* Please include a genre tag in your title. Examples: [DnB], [Dubstep], [IDM], etc.

* Please have a specific question in mind, not just, ""What do you think?"" Examples of specific questions: ""What do you think about this kick sample?"" ""How's this mix?"" ""I need some help on this melody, the last measure comes off a little cheesy, any ideas?"" etc.

* Please make an effort to comment on others' questions. Even if you can't give any production tips, you can give an opinion of how it sounds. Production veterans, please be as helpful as possible. Production newbies, please be as descriptive in your opinion, and hence as helpful as possible.

* Courtesy and respect. Like for real. We are NOT a group of elitists and this sort of attitude will not be tolerated. ""This is not dubstep"" ""shutup hipster"" ""i hate all these rusko fanboys"" type posts should be downvoted and ignored. Please report these.

Posts that are NOT for this subreddit:

* Hey all, check out my song I just released.

* Listen to this Deadmau5 track!

* Check out my new toy! [picture of your new shiny moog]

* I'm sick of all this dubstep, lets get some Drum and Bass in here! [without posting your own song and asking for advice]

Also, I think it's important to specifically define EDM. Electronic Dance Music essentially is the most generic, to my knowledge, genre of music that encompasses all music produced electronically on a computer using a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). This includes obscure genres that aren't specifically ""dance"" like Breakcore and IDM.

I intentionally waited a week or so to post this to let the community settle in and for us mods to get a better of idea of what we wanted here. Now that we've been here for a week, we felt it was time to outline a little common courtesy etiquette for this community. If people stick to these ideals, I am confident this will become a prosperous and beneficial community for all those involved. We are here for the same reason: our love of producing electronic music.

Please feel free to propose other etiquette ideals to be considered.

I'm not happy with my progress, it could be faster.  Yes, straight 4 on the floor beats are easy, some basic breakbeats, but it feels more like trial and error than anything else.  I want to learn the theory behind programming drum patterns.

I'll take a quick diversion to point out a lot of ways that resources online seem to talk about it.  Half of it is people talking about being drummers, and how they adapt to using pads.  This isn't too relevant to me.  The other half usually consist of ""take a beat you like, layer your own beats over the top and reconstruct the pattern"".  This is a very tedious process, and doesn't explain the theory.  There are a lot of resources on music theory, I wouldn't expect to learn chords, harmony or something like that through similar trial and error.

So what are good resources for the **theory** of percussion and programming it into a pattern.  How to structure a breakbeat.  How to use volume to accentuate beats over others.  How to make a groove or backbeat.  What sort of patterns to use on the percussion/hi-hats/etc, and what effect they have - syncopation, using triplets etc etc.  These are all things I've learned CAN have an effect, but I want to learn all the theory of it, from a drum pattern programming standpoint.

Recently, I've been reading up on ""magic frequencies"" and ""sweet spots"" for different instruments. All of this reading has made mixing and mastering my instruments a lot easier. I found that I was able to give each instrument its own room within a track while making the entire track sound more full and less muddy. This has inspired me to try my hand at creating a  multi-instrument mastering suite for Ableton.

Now, this is only a work in progress right now, and I could be going about things totally wrong, but hey, that's how you learn, right?

What I've done is create 6 different EQ channels each for a particular instrument. I set a frequency range  that pertains to a specific characteristic such as clarity, body, warmth, etc., and mapped that to a macro control on an audio rack. I also mapped gains to macro controls so you can either boost or cut out said characteristics.

I've tested these eq channels on several of my instruments and patches, and they sounded awesome! I would love it if some of you would try it out for yourselves and come back to me with any advice, criticism, etc. Again, I could totally be going about this the wrong way, but I'm willing to make myself look like an ass if that means I'll learn more. =P

So with all of that said, here is the dropbox link:

https://dl.dropbox.com/u/79937213/Mastering%20Suite%20%28WIP%29.zip

If it turns out I'm on the right track, then my goal will be to create more eq channels for this suite and give it away for free. I just need some test subjects first =P

tl;dr: I created an instrument mastering suite. I need to know if I'm on the right track with it so I'm giving you guys a demo. :D

Thanks!

EDIT: Here is the link to the full version. I have been told that this process is actually mixing rather than mastering, so I've renamed the folder accordingly. If you guys have any questions or concerns, feel free to PM or comment here.

I know I'm not the only one who has a giant pile of random ideas, sketched down melodies and half made draft's. Most of which would make perfectly good tracks, but i either found myself stuck, unmotivated, or i don't feel for them anymore. So why not share them around for other people to possibly use? (With giving credit to the creator if they finish the track, of course)


How it could work:

We could either all post a few of the mini demos with the melody or the basis of the started track on sound cloud, or possibly upload the song file to a hosting site. (I personally think the sound cloud idea, due to different DAW's)
And depending on what everyone thinks is best, we could either choose to trade them between us, or possibly just give them away to whoever fancies them, as long as they credit you in their work. I have a few chosen out myself which may become useful to others. Even if you aren't looking for anything in return, why not just give away a draft or 2. I'm sure there are a lot of beginners who would find working from an already developed idea very beneficial.

If other people are interested, tomorrow i will make another post to carry it out.

&gt;So here's the typical problem. A bunch of noisy guitars driving along and you want to inject an acoustic guitar or vocal lead in there once in a while. But you can't get the track hot enough or eq'd enough to overcome the noisy guitars. Ducking the guitars with either automation or a sidechained compressor might be too noticable, so this trick allows you to just duck the specific frequency range that is masking your lead track. Here's how to do it: 

1. This is a mix technique and we'll be assigning plugs to auxes, so make sure PDC is set to ""All"" in your preferences.

2. Assign your noisy guitar tracks to a bus. We'll use bus 10 as in my example. 

3. Assign your lead track to your main outputs. Create a Send on this track to bus 11 and set its level to unity, (ctrl-click the send).. This will also create an aux in your mixer. Delete this aux. 

4. Create 2 new aux channels. Assign both their inputs to Bus 10, and both their outputs to your main outs. 

5. Don't put any plugs on the first aux. On the second aux, (from top to bottom) place a Linear Phase EQ, a Noise Gate, then a Gain plug. 

6. Set the EQ up with a Lopass and a Hipass only, with steep 48dB/oct slopes. Leave the Q at .71. 

7. Set the Noise Gate as follows. 
Threshold &amp; Reduction: -100dB 
Attack, Hold &amp; Release: 0mS 
Hysteresis: -20dB 
Lookahead: 20.000mS 
Sidechain: Bus 11 

8. Open the Gain plug and enable Phase Invert(s). Close the Gain plug. 


&gt;Here's what's happening in my example. When the acoustic guitar plays, the gate opens up on the second aux track that has the flipped phase noisy guitar signal. With the EQ bypassed and the aux faders at unity, you'l hear none of the noisy guitars as they will cancel out. In my example, I want to hear more of the body of the acoustic guitar which is about 225 to 1300 Hz so that's what I've set the EQ to pass. So now everything below and above that band won't be canceled. If I drop the fader down on the second aux, then the signal isn't cancelled as much. 

&gt;When the acoustic plays, the body of the guitar sound comes through the mix a bit more as I'm attenuating the noisy guitars just in that band and just while the acoustic is playing. So your guitars can keep driving along! 

&gt;You have a lot of control as you can tweak the reversed aux's fader for the amount of ducking and tweak the lo and hi pass freq parameters on the EQ to tune the band that gets ducked.

**Producer:**

&gt; Hey! I noticed that a recurring comment underneath production questions is ""what DAW are you using"". There's cool SoundCloud flair, but would a tiny flair logo of DAW be worth considering?

&gt;Cheers

**rxi:**

&gt; Nope.

&gt; All this would do is promote DAW-prejudice. It won't benefit anyone here and won't do anything but help people get a possibly false and possibly negative preconception about other producers based on what DAW they use. Your DAW is just a tool and parading it around next to your name is not the sort of behaviour we want to encourage.

**Producer:**

&gt; Phew, that's a pretty negative approach to the suggestion, but fine.

**i_lyke_money:**

&gt; haha, don't feel down. rxi just has a naturally angry tone but deep down inside he's a fluffy little bunny who we all love &lt;3 :3.

&gt; all of the mods agree with the sentiment behind rxi's response though, in that it would only create ""daw-prejudice"".

&gt; the ""what daw are you using"" threads do happen every so often but it will pretty much always happen inevitably in every production forum.

**Producer:**

&gt; Ah, okay. Thanks for the explanation. I truly did not suggest it as some sort of badge of honor (or potential point of strive) but more as a practical way to pre-empt the question in the many 'How can I' threads of late.

**mwd410:**

&gt; No worries, Producer. Don't worry--we had no misconception about your intent. It's true, I totally agree with the other guys.

&gt; In truth, production techniques are very much daw-independent. Asking the question ""what daw do you use?"" is next to useless for the majority of questions asked. This is because ""Boost the snare around 200 and 2k, then compress with about a 3.5 ratio to get about 3-5 db of peak reduction"" means exactly the same thing on Ableton as it does on Logic.

&gt; A slightly further explanation of specifically what rxi said--FL studio is frequently known as a crappy DAW that has little to know ability to create professional quality sound. This is complete and utter nonsense. Many well known producers (porter robinson, for instance) use FL and get banger tracks just as easy as the next guy. The reason people get that misconception is that FL studio is very frequently the first daw somebody picks up (I'm no exception), and so there are a high percentage of new producers using it.

&gt; The point is that every daw has its strengths and its weaknesses, and each one is perfectly capable of creating professional quality tracks.

Very few of my friends/acquaintances are musicians,producers, DJ's,etc. and the ones that are see it as more of a hobby rather than something they could see themselves doing as a career. All of them are either back where I'm from or in their home town right now as well. So I was wondering, how can I meet other music producers in real life? I'm not really down for the whole over the internet collaboration sort of thing. I tried kijiji ads and all I met were casual musicians who didn't really have any serious aspirations, ambition or dedication. I want to meet other people who are as passionate as me, I just don't know where they are. If it helps, I live in Halifax, Canada.

...
Hi guys, first I’d like to say that this sub has been extremely helpful in my development as a producer and most of what I know comes from this community.  Some of the best ways I have found to improve have been both giving and receiving feedback in both the feedback threads and plug.dj meetups.  With this in mind, would people want to officially have a meetup that is more carefully moderated and focused in the discussion chatbox towards feedback and thoughtful advice on tracks?

I do not want to change the way the current meetups are structured.  It is fun to hang out in the plug.dj and do the substance of your choice and shoot the shit about production and Kompressing and give the odd advice on drum levels or a complement about how sweet a drop is.  Sometimes pretty good advice is given...  But to me the majority of it isn't completely well thought out and a lot more careful/honest feedback could be given.  I feel it would be very useful to a lot of the people in the community to have a more focused meetup once a week (or however often people like) where careful, thoughtful advice on anything from arrangement ideas to EQ advice to general songwriting thoughts.  You could even ask questions of the person playing the track and they could answer as best they could if you enjoyed a particular part of it.  If nobody in the room were filling up the chatbox with inane chatter or just plain off doing something else not listening to others’ tracks everybody would get a lot more out of it.  Think about it like this... listening to a track and deciding what to do to make it better is the skill we as producers are trying to improve at to make better songs.  YOU SHOULD WANT TO GIVE UP OTHERS CAREFUL FOCUSED FEEDBACK, it will help you so much in your own production.

I propose we have a meetup on Tuesdays that is carefully moderated and understood to be a very focused, professional forum for improving each others tracks and challenging each other to get better.  Does 9pm EST work for anybody?  I’ll be in the room tonight and I can stay for a few hours I’d be happy to give close advice to anybody that wants and would welcome the same on some of my newer tracks that I’m trying to improve.

Again I do not hate the way the rooms are done now... it is a lot of fun for everybody.  I’m just proposing an idea that I think would help a lot of us improve.  Before anybody says ‘this is what happens in the plug.dj room’, no.  Not really.  I’ve seen entire songs play without a single comment or advice.  Lots of people leave and don’t listen until its their turn to play.  Often the only things that are said are halfhearted praise at whichever element of the track you think is good enough to comment on in passing.  I was once told after asking for feedback that somebody liked my track but didn’t know what to say because they were drawing in whatever enjoyable group drawing website is.  I’m fine with this if that’s what the community wants the plug.dj room to be for, but I think it’d be great to have a more serious one on tuesday.  Come in tonight and get some careful advice on your mix, then tighten it up and set it off in the room tomorrow night!

I hope this doesn’t come off as too dickish... I really just want everybody here (including myself) to get better!  I love you guys!

The issue here is that when switching tracks you will need to disable any effects on your master first and doing that means you need to stop your track , disable the effects and listen to the othe track . Thing is , you don't want that ""gap"" when you're doing a comparison because you are going to lose marks of what the levels and frequency content were on the track you just listened .

 So , getting around this is very easy , you want to set up an audio channel were you are going to put the reference track and mute it . Now open the key or midi map mode and assign the solo button of that track to any button you want on your keyboard or controller . Now group all your master channel effects and map the device activation button to the same key and you are done !
 
  Now you can switch from track to track instantly with a single button   and no gap in the audio !

 Hope this helps !
 Cheers

* Try to imagine your tune pumping out of a nice sound system in the club, and the crowd's reaction - the drop is where you catch them, carry them through!
* Imagine how your song would fit in a set and mix with it, especially if you would like to show it to a DJ. You know how to mix, right? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
* Think of the track(s) you would like your's to sound like and compare your mixdown and mastering to it. Make sure to pick out where the individual parts fit frequency-wise!
* Listen to your track on every thing you can, a great mixdown will sound good on almost anything; earbuds, TV speakers, laptop speakers, regular headphones, car stereo...
* If you have a sound you processed, EQ'd, modulated, threw effects on, and it **still** feels off, just ditch it! You can always cannibalize the MIDI and/or patch and reapply it somewhere else.
* This last one is hard for me to even accomplish but is one of the best and most helpful I've ever come across: *Finish what you start!*

I've created an instrument for Kontakt 5 featuring the Yamaha Grand Piano from the CX-series.

The instrument should work for Kontakt 5 Player (which is free) so there is nothing stopping you from trying this one out.

**Why free?**

For this to be able to reach comercial status, it would need to have all notes recorded, or be able to resample all the notes to a certain degree, which it does not. It also does not have manual velocity recorded for each note, but rather recreated with volume inside Kontakt.

The instrument does recreate the pitch accuratly, but some overtones obviously does not get recreated perfectly.

It was only recorded with one long sample, which means the volume envelope is created by code.

**Can I use this in my productions?**

Even though it is free, which is hard to beat, it does not sound as good as the professional comercial variants out on the market. However, it does sound good enough to use in productions. You are also free to use these samples or instruments in your productions, as long as you put my name as the creator of the package, recordings and instrument creation, and do not claim it to be your own. You can find the details in the readme.txt that follows with the piano.zip file.

It might be a nice change to use this, instead of using the grandpiano of Nexus :)

**Will there be a comercial follow up on this?**

The plan at a later point, is to create a package that meets the above requirements, which will be released in that case under my homepage www.syrou.eu (under construction)

**Where do I get it?**

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5256694/piano.zip

If you wish to supply a mirror for the file, since dropbox is quite slow, that would be appriciated.

**Who is the Creator?**

Wallpaper for the piano was taken from http://www.flickr.com/photos/oldpiano/

**Genre:** *Postremo*

**Tempo:** *Prestissimo, +178 beats per minute.*

**Time signature:** *3/4, 4/4,5/8, 6/8, 7/8, 17/8*

**Instrumentation:**

Synthetic and Natural percussion representing a wide variety of percussive timbres. Speedy Synths with nearly constantly changing timbres Characteristics:

Recent experiments at a theoretical physics laboratory in the United States have uncovered what appears to be coded audio data from an unknown origin. There is speculation that the messages are from a parallel universe or perhaps from a future point in our timeline. Based on signal analysis, the audio data appears to encode a rich amount of harmonics.

Most blocks or “songs” span from 180 to 200 seconds. There is most always a decrease of data halfway through the song, suggesting a drop of harmonics. 

Another feature common with all of the data is an ever changing compositional structure such that no two sections are Identical. No two measures/bars^1 are exactly the same with bars/measures towards the end of the compositions being much different than those at the start.  Time signatures may or may not vary.

Further analysis has shown that this music is based on the Prometheus Scale^2. The reasons for this remains unknown.)

I'll be giving up a days work to do this so I ask if you can all be kind enough to help make it as orderly as possible by following the following guidelines, that way I can help as many people as possible.

- No more than 2 tracks per person, make sure they are the tracks you need the help with the most or your best tracks that you wish to know how to improve even further.
- If you have a specific question i.e. ""How to i make the bass not clash with the kick"" that will help get a more useful response from me
- Don't OVERDO the master channel, I can give you better mixdown feedback if I'm not trying to tell what went wrong on the master channel and the mixdown at the same time. 
- If you are uncomfortable posting your track in public, follow this url and submit it to me directly: https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form?EQBCT=00970c24db6044f5982f3ec92796cea1
- Make sure your track is labelled well and there's some contact information.. If I hear a bloody amazing track, I will be sure to send it on to relevant people at the label I work with (with your permission)
- If you post soundcloud links and they are secret, please make sure that you give me the secret link otherwise I won't be able to hear the track
